The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry industry.
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious linguistic barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their new colleagues from the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when Prague was governed by the current members of the coalition.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political nata during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bem, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand those well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"But I am a beginner in the Praguenese politics," said the Lukáš Kaucký cultural councillor during the examination of terminology of "college".
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel Březina reacted equally.
Maybe they know the concept of golf hoyo.
"Perhaps it's the only expression of everyone you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, usually in slang jobs."
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published by Aktuálně.cz last June before the voting congress of the ODS, the wording chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "torus nucca", "treason of the capital" and "blindar".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will in future be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get involved in these things and I'm not going to appreciate how civic democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, allegedly Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" tells him nothing; the only term he reached in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, immediately adding, "but rather I know it from the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," she jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental councilman Lukáš Plachý.
Then, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but we really don't seem to have anything like it."
"But among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make word games with names," says ČSSD's Praguenese president, Petr Hulinský, whose matchmates call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
Aktuálně.cz tested the name and works.
For his party mates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the election deceptions during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname "Igraček" ("playmobil") from some of his peers.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speaking within the party.
Hulínský does not like being called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this president in Prague.
"The doctor of the rights of the sluts" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "brujas", as published in a brochure
Women considered witch in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be older, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer like this."
"There is no isolation for healthy young women, because they help in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa Burkina Faso, occupies a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information leaflet that should help to prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," says the Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah died, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was taken into the oil used for ritual anointings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "expulse the bad spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of "brujas" supports people of all levels of education.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls have always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to calm down witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian president Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that, supposedly, had been linked to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him, he brought the shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, took the men and women chosen at random among the Gambian peoples to the President's property in Kanilai," says Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, arrested persons had to drink a handful of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people arrested.
The tenant of Bakala: warms up with coal stoves and signs a higher rental
The man, old and clean, crossed the doors of the center of customer service of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-storey leases: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
The three of them just caught the rent liberalisation.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 kroner for a two-room flat with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water available and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows the man with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOK.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends tenants who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in view of this, man only makes a demise.
"Everything says a thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of proof of liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were up to now under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG's waiting room is one of four ostrava's and, on Tuesday at nine, was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and beside them a machine to take number.
"Rent 2011", can be read in a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a little paper comes out of the machine with a number.
It almost gives no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the room crowd is not here for new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as old times: settlement requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the lodges of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38 per cent.
On November 18th, a special window is opened at the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalisation and former mining floors in Bakala are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, treated them loud and clear, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"Nor did I change the damn toilet dish," the man mentioned in the introduction was drowned.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than nothing retired to check whether they receive a discount on the rental if they sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the February rental discount for the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the "liberalization" mine certainly does not dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked for the rent in 2011 about forty-fifty people," says the saleswoman.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and in its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties fail to reach an agreement on rent, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
"This is not a threat, it is information about the only possible and complete way to proceed in accordance with the law," says RPG on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I don't have the means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The regulation of rent will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents do not yet cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, opposite the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlight in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month," is indicated on the screen.
Only increases the rent of 400 floors in the RPG portfolio by 38%.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities of 19.66 kroner per square meter," says RPG.
In 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect rents in any way, but will escalate between four and eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the rental (see the chart) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental ascent agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all its own to such facilities: coloured walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can come to her.
The architectural projects firm Arch.Design, of which numerous well-known buildings of Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the building Avriopoint to include a space for its mini-guard.
In the company work about 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow architects and delineants to return soon to work after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a small schedule, kindergarten is one of the benefits Arch offers.Design your workers within the framework of your social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Design's own employees and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-guard of the company is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the Czech Republic State budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a provision of over 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to buy equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to maintain the mini-guardry with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the submission of the request for funding contributed to the Economy Rating company.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day long. The day-care centre currently houses children without age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since this is a "ministership", it can only accommodate up to five children at the same time, even though with shifts they turn more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guard programme are comparable to the regular pre-school programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach even English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from work.
Parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among the companies that sign that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The home of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar shape to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones."
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the new use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and the omnipresent lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and texture drawn from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and order are observed carefully thought out.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the torsion of the forms continue to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the rails, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district in the number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
Reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on overthrowing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of carrying out a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not design it by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project, ornaments arose for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Park Güell de Gaudí, in which other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows, began to call it "the box house."
It is also said that, at the height of the construction, the sword of St. Jorge appears, master of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilating ventilators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange to see his 40 - five - degree inclination.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the construction rules of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although clearly in it the indicated data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so impacted with the result that it requested that it be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public side.
The arrangements never took place, rather on the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of the town hall, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
On the lower floors was installed the owner himself.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, with six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection of space.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way without any problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and more recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the door to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The visits confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entrance to the monument is not negligible, it reaches 16,50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighbouring houses and visit you at home.
How mattress and somier are chosen: women and men look for different things
Nothing from a pompous frame for bed; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, mattress and somier.
First of all, they must complement perfection so that they can be adapted to specific users.
During the election many elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
Moreover, they often weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central canals are not properly aired and, above, they are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Even mold can appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence customs.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their brushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"This type of mattresses is also recommended for people with diabetes who have long nervous system problems, so they are poorly informed by joints and skin," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropic brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard game.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastics also function as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: as you lie face up, you should have hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouniką to dekoratérą, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a theme that he teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to assemble the smiles at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interiors of a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When touching him with your hand or by settling in on the mattress, no doubt the docks should be noticed," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain kind of somier.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which mattress and base are like Siamese, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and cannot wash their case, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that talk about a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a life guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully deal with cleaning and washing the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers with zip fasteners are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opening them, they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and washing!), their manipulation in larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, do you have a firm table?
Never!
At most for beds designed to spend one night visits.
However, you should do (if you don't have them already) ventilation holes on the table and it should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-artictable sheet soms containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses may be used (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre), although it is always better a somier with a larger number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the blades of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Joint blade sommers should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection may also be used.
This is a special fixation of the blades that allows to press or even tilt the blades in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male" began to use a softer area right around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for which they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are smiles with cross structure or tables with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also take into account that, even if you use the right mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "wow"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles can relax themselves.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the somier with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest area of the mattress) than the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, e.g. castor or soya.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of mattresses, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "cooled" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress bottom absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer "heat" the mattress.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warm.
The Favorites Currently?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allow the manufacture of mattresses from different areas that perfectly know where the head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you 7,000 crowns up.
Those who have a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, since they are considered as health facilities.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is complicated to save on mattresses and smiles.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreez mattresses with a memory memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is available free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and great density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the take-offs astronaut wools were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
It is therefore ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed to track vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of matches, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
"We are all trying to tell ourselves that it is not a matter of spying, but of another means to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to take him, he will simply throw him away.
"Even younger children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, the parents trusted the mobiles enormously, but they could be deleted as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child carries some type of electronic device that can reveal its location."
"Now it's the phone."
"The use of follow-up devices is being extended, and will also seek out them, since their sale will certainly take place with great publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a given period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have a tilt meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and remains still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," Čech says.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, in which only a special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a box of matches or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify him after some time, which can make the police earn time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround all of Chechnya. But it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to arrest explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of mega.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the mecha life is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the explosive mecha from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million kroner.
General staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha by saying that soldiers need for training manoeuvres 60 kilometers of mecha a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, they should perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want the defence minister Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army to be exempted.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometres of micha.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional reaches a maximum of two metres of mega, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained to Minister Vondra recently because they say they have barely ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand either that he's repeatedly buying us such amounts of wick."
"But it's their decision and they will certainly know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of mega, also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a lifespan of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by the possible criticisms of the army, do not want to give his name.
After the end of their lifetime, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, it obtained a discount.
"We cost 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says Pejšek spokesman for the Ministry of Defence's shopping center.
To compare only: the annual consumption of mecha from police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammo from the Second World War or the left by the Soviet army, has not for years exceeded 1,500 metres.
In addition, the police always ask only for the fair amount of ammunition to be exhausted before the end of their useful life.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnic and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of 200 thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: it will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being purchased "barata".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got through the competition.
The win of the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the "Entrepreneur of the year" contest, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story seems to be drawn from a film.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad realized that quality housing was needed at a good price in Liberec.
With the savings I had with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-done composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the price-quality ratio of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first reconstructed floor for foreign workers.
All the income he received was invested again in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he managed to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the number one entrepreneur of last year.
"To this sale of licences for the opening of hotels greatly helped to win the 'Entrepreneur of the year' contest," Pytloun adds gratefully.
Victory increased its fame and popularity in both Liberec and the surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Undoubtedly, it recommends to everyone that they want to try some company that participates in the competition.
But it does not consider it necessary to win, but participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest, I started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition."
"It is not, let alone, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"Only my name appears in the foreground," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have gone through the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel ŽŽárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the year", last year in the "Slava House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence in the fight against competition," says the winner of last year.
The story of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel’s father Žárský the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with his father of plastic piles.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to consider Farmet as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel ŽŽárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also received recognition of the commercial results until 2008 and, in part, of 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, did not escape this situation."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," explains Karel ŽŽárský.
A viable company should sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and got great ratings at national fairs," Žğárský says.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel ŽŽárský.
A Survey that Unveils Ridiculous Standards
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is a fourth time in the corporate tournament.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when carrying out a check on the taxes of the insured person," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdity survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the corporate tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create a hobby also among the general public.
While last year's edition was attended by three thousand voters, this year nearly reached four thousand.
And it's not surprising, since we still have a number of legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers necessary for tax reporting we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czech Republic is in position 74a, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and each year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prime" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that receives more votes.
For this year's survey more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
The examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world are usually involved.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the State is continually hindering entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations were not left in drunken water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate in advance of three days to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the office of work by its foreign workers on working travel for up to 30 days, was deleted in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is over.
Absurdness of the year 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a great mirror, a fridge and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hostodářské noviny contest is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of the 2010 Vodafone Empresa main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies completely between activities, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, persons with disabilities, other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists throughout the Republic, for example, the company Praguenese software Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years now.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; that is why he received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Empresa competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it buys Czech manufacturers as a priority, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities can have the least impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
The Praní laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region is also placed in good place with a mention, the employees of which receive subsidies in a special way that affect their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, upgrading skills and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of the construction company Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Empresa contest of the year who answered the questions of the registration form were automatically appointed and sent to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed the forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of Company responsible for the year, but were not disqualified from the "main" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main Company competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
I should have paid Luboš G. half a million kroner for that.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a briber during a public auction and public tender," said Právo, Chief Prosecutor of the Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being he cannot disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur.
On how it could influence public auction, given the limited official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomira Černa Agricultural Fund responded to Pravo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the summons, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the field value is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," explained the Fund spokesman.
Luboš G. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, since he was both interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to stakeholders on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
For this reason, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former chief of the Václav Sankot PF, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly where a large road should be built in the industrial area of Borská pole.
Later, he changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the town hall had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked land would avoid construction.
Families must pay additional expenses of several hundred kroner a month
Households will have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Therefore, families will have to pull several hundred crowns a month more than now from January onwards.
The price of electricity rises by 4.6%, gas is about 2%, in some cities they have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns per year more than now.
However, major electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately increased, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred crowns more each year.
While electricity and gas are growing throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
Price rises are mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay since January for central heating about 50 kroner per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 kroner per year.
Prague residents will also have to bear a 9 per cent increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, the praguens will pay 6.8% extra.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rent prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns around 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will bring the courts to those who do not agree to the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase the coming year to 10%.
Czech youth get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer so, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under 15 years of age.
The children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who are involved in such cases in the hospital's pediatric admissions.
"Beber beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," says Prevo, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle from their father in the hall, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and does not smell so much," he explains.
The spokesman for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, also confirms this.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spiritists who took home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikan, they are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years of age who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It began at the age of twelve, when she was brought with 3.5 of alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture of ecstasy," says the department doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother was not surprised that her daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
The experts point out that, in the case of children, it cannot be spoken of as a dependency.
"Alcoholic means a person who has chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena associated with alcohol, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those with severe poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the medical examination, go home to their parents or to the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink a spirit, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that can be mentioned: Witch Day, End of Year and end of school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once," adds Pelikan.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"This is much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"Only when they are confused about where they are", says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer into an ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients costs about ten thousand kroner.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I tell the children directly on the visit how much it has cost their drunkenness and that they would have to spend all summer on a job for young people to earn enough to pay for that night," Pelikan adds.
The health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns people the treatment expenses, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in the hands of others in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time that a device of this kind is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for training or demonstration flights.
This is the two-sided version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 monopla.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales broker, Omnipol company, has already taken over them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159, on the other hand, were separated from the fixed-wing aircraft long ago, without any additional investments or inputs from the Ministry."
"The bipla L-159T1 were exchanged in their present state," Pravo Pejšek said.
He added that the army did not run out of bipla planes, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a quantity of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 unnecessary devices for bipla.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to adding the aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that removes the L-159 aircraft and will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," Pejšek says.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Home aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a bid for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence management claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes possibly comes to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely's Praguenese airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help to determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the shorter right-hand Indian finger than the annular finger.
They had the same chances of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with ages below 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the foetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "shown completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, like most of Europe, pawned on Thursday covered in snow.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and the shantytown machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the road D5 was closed between km 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of Ústředního autotoklubu (UAMK).
In kilometre 91, a truck was damaged, in 93, two industrial vehicles were hit and injured.
Several tourists also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 towards Prague.
There they hit two trucks.
Drivers should circulate slowly after Brno at kilometre 190 or pass through Brno and be incorporated into kilometre 182 in Kývalce.
There, attacks of several kilometres have been formed.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Attacks, for example, are being formed in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams circulate late, for example on the line between Karlovo naměstí and Náměstí Miru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company must have cancelled seven connections by three rapids.
Problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně was closed from eleven in the night of Wednesday until five in the morning.
Currently, it can already be circulated on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to circulation, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
To date the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, millers will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as ČTK indicates.
In Czechia, two to ten inches of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfalls gradually flow back to Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and to "change the progress of the game" made their victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise aim.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
There is no doubt that normal protection cannot be used and, when you launch your murderous rain from metal rods, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who talked about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the line of projection and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say it's been 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pushed, the gun loads and throws the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are relocated
The Fujitsu consortium moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex at Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad neighbourhood in Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term 100 more employees than the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" has been won with that.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu sits in the city, settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The address informed the city earlier about its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives led to the fall.
In this way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the building's owner and landlord show cooperatives."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the waste buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial project of construction of the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance is formed to the city, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and as to the level of buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and charging companies, the Software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, and then merged Siemens with the computer manufacturer house Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the real estate group Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenty years, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats to Assange
Anxiety is becoming more and more like Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet service provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
Political pressure is possibly behind after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
Wikileaks' platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, which is always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for a European Internet homeland.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted people, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"To speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelation activists communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service web in order to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfectly, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its server through Wikileaks, after a senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate's security council had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I had wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before previous information publications classified through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and unconsidered Wikileaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," he said in an independent senator's statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted people.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian is under arrest in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has consistently rated research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, Arkansas' former Republican governor Mike Huckabee said that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, he said a chief of government advisor Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there is a big dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for President Barack Obama, called for "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in spying tasks.
"I'm not absolutely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed as an exceptional leader, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must endanger Wikileaks' publication.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if necessary."
University of ice cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the greatest affluence and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream really come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream maker produces cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The gelatoio takes out with a spatula the cream of the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the greatest affluence and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special extra day courses on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice-cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
It is not only their good taste but also their silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to production seems very easy.
Luciano throws out the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white cream comes out, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural or non-sampling elements?
How can one give loose reindeer to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises them to ignore the trends of the time.
He who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", at best he has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Flavours are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into your merchandise."
"But you must experience it sometimes."
Be it with fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them prepare four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with fruit ice cream types.
That you know better doesn't necessarily depend on you having more tofe aroma or more pure fruit.
There is no need for hazelnut ice cream to be known for dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group prepares the lovable kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is a problem of artymetics: melocoton purée with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe has to be reduced.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which to fix the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easy to count.
Making ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously beats the mixture of prepared ice cream and cools at a temperature below zero.
However, all automation is left out for the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if it were a giant mini primer without control.
"In all courses," said Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry it experiences with genetically modified plants.
This is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, Head of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired for years in the Illy Association.
Consorcios like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost him.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly on Efsa's testing standards of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticises.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi's situation and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking Efsa manager was without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and he has changed his gang with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as an EU Parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this matter, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified corn in agriculture," Then says.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you going to meet?", asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
Scientists have been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and are currently working at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Thus, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was at Stuttgart Station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations
Snow.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
Stuttgart's land was never the same again: Thousands and thousands marched against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was rubble.
Rotated at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
Like he said once, he smelled smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The stouttgart stone trail leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition tank, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He's bought everything from demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be dishonorable, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dumpster," he says in his office, a wooden house that once was a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remains of the north wing to the hit company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-pound cut-out, with a price per slice from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest of it has long since been sold.
Landlord, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If not for the political component."
Ascent to its all-rounder, make a tour of its great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And she's a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sting sandstones.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Point out a lot: Red sandstone, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And follow.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the solids belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the Sankt Blasien church, toba of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were to be destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave what to do to the stone dealer, besides quarries, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasssmith and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue there.
Talent struggle around great potentials
Queen an active affluence in the buffet.
16 students swallow around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, you have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Your mission: To recruit the most talented students in universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, they try to delight exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady of the staff department distributes pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the illustrious young talents the training programs and work for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet the students, observe more closely the interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point above was in the technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to advertise themselves and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 positions of vacant engineers.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes costly recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of Yucana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight highly promising students to the U.S. the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities increasingly strive to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey itself was short."
For the Dykta hunters the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some of them are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's very complicated to fill in the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Professors advise that you can practice with us or perform your thesis.
No advertising campaigns are being carried out for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium normally cannot offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good opportunities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his classification by his aspiring people to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advises your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the own staff.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappellant manner.
Also on the Atlantic coast remain new perforations fenced for the moment.
This announced the interior minister, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost 11 workers their lives and caused the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
In this way, supporters wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To this day it has not been entirely clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British BP energy consortium, which is faced with millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different peterile consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which, after being charged with corruption charges, has now fallen into disbelief, is reformed at the root.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative fiscal gaps for the oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the greatest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current poll conducted by the BDO consulting company - before Wednesday's ban on extraction.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are being extended at the same time, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters poured out of crude have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal trade in oil.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today will pass enough oil in front of you."
The Nigerian 37-year-old has been able to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It doesn't look like brown oil stains are floating on the surface.
Earlier here, she took her legs to her fists, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and situated in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most dense regions of the world.
On the path of the river passing through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which sinks its hand into the water, will bring out a few oil fills.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark regal sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain are flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier of the exterior is shut up, a sort of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with a smell of gas station is expanded into it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is carried out.
The area of the Ogoni settlement is a reborn battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke down more than 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here he had to put his first Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the oil workers.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is forbidden: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold every day in the entire region of the delta, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each two hundred meters excel steel platforms as extraphalian water sculptures: "Christmas trees" lovingly called the perforators heads.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
A head, Akpobari thinks, is missing every moment, so he manages a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to the experts' assessments, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the fault of the "Exxon Valdez" ship 21 years ago into the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and pipes with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world the conventional, blamed scientist Richard Steiner for the consortium in 2008: Only the indexes of tube defects are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere."
In one place, which from a distance seems forgotten, there appears an oil-filled workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
One of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, calls a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil warms up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, then the oil pipe drips and finally comes out of diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 nira", about 22 dollars.
Delta inhabitants take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just EUR 40-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the pipeline network that runs through Ogonilandia: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost in the entire Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the temporary raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and senior military officials, keep the best part in the Aljibes and sell it cheaply in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considered the debate purely academic as to whether the environmental disaster was due rather to the management of the population or to the loose way of production.
"If the oil tankers did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only one deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the army's special unit catches illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arresting them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to benefit from the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely broken our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas Airlines want to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers at the Qantas Airbus which carried out an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: The Australian air safety authorities have seen thanks to their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alert to a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated consequences: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those found the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a complaint at the Sidney Federal Court that allowed more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests for overts equipped with the engines concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa repelled the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nevada all over the country causes chaos in traffic
All white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Ice Germany: In almost the whole country, freezing temperatures were reached during the night of Thursday, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
In the A7 at Flensburg, the snowshoes are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but are not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects lively tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimetres of new fall snow and cold and strong winds take care of it.
A lot of trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
In Saxony Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major riots on the streets.
In A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed traffic and created attacks.
In Thuringia the snows affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, falling trees on the lanes or the broken chain and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
The firefighters and the rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Snow winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, winds with snow caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The harnesses are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers thrown into the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds ready for them.
In many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: Also here a truck was reached at a crossing of tracks because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's route to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after flying her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have a good news: Snow will be softer and dustier and will therefore be swirled in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to €500 million.
Recently Deutschen Bank established its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank neighborhood; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to take advantage of the costs of renovating, and look for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as stated by the "Financial Times Deutschland" on the basis of a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale on the project.
"We always check whether we should own or sell the properties and then rent them again," he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany once again renounces its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for €272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some €200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area estimate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed "Greentowers" at around €500 million.
If renewed buildings are sold at a bank fund or an independent investor has not been disclosed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourn for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the corpses have not been found, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near Greymouth City.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the place of misfortune, but no sign of survival was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be released for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been able to recover to date.
Currently, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright shine of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand island of the South.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags waved a half auction in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, to journalists.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does the gore fit in artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the borders of the genre with his epic of battles "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of by filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his torturers and assassinates his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies apart the guts of his bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the bastitors offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown and interested filmmakers in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a shame that they cannot be mutually excluded.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and trilogy on the "Pusher" drug-trafficking hairstyle to be a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses stoically to make his works for all audiences with something more humorous in the mainstream or somewhat less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and a few guts that sprout can't deter most followers of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troupe of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity in calm and fog is stuck before his team reaches America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of film is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for viewers.
Refn is condemned just a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the grim soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, that from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde, who supports Unojo faithfully, preserves something as innocent, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior from hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this matter until checks are allowed.
About half-night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 I Israeli warplanes attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Éufrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), deals with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA's international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves any other purpose than that of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
It had been a short time since the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later, the bombardment is hardly better known than at that time, the enigmas became older over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he hardly saw indications that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "pleasible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a high diplomat of the UN responded in summer in a stoning manner that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly disbanded themselves from the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and raided the ground to conscience.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by individuals.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a Member State, from commercial sellers at the time of the attack, who must have a higher information value than the CIA had.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected him as an inverosemil after particle analysis.
Since then Damaskus has refused to discuss this, just as with respect to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are banned from a second inspection in the Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also has a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "has gradually become a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious infringement of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons is finally pending, for which the IAEA looks.
The IAEA considers three more equipment as the key to progress in clarifying, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not made public until the time when equipment is being treated, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as an intern to Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possibly on or immediately beside a military base, Syria thus prohibits the entry into the IAEA of all three places.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to U.S. Secret Service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates shore.
A Western diplomat with a senior position in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities", no enrichment of uranium or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium must come from and where the plutonium for the pumps must be subsequently separated, for these central questions there are, in the best case, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
Since the hundreds of loads of trucks have disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE sees as unlikely the salt mine al-Tibni, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 because of its ability as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, connected her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three alleged suspicious locations and eliminated large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be random, but it hardly helps to dispel the suspicion.
Furthermore, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, that the Syrians would allow, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
In the meantime, Damaskus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador fencing the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has talked about "an option that I am open to in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: for this, most of the IAEA governing board is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still unnamed.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
It is not known much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
Rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, which at the last moment has moved a few days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hassecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested an encounter with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, women offered him a meeting in Hungary weeks ago that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasic.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on the matter tells the victims enough about the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be removed as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The ministry of Bosnian culture that read the script, granted after a strip and loosens a record permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is introduced with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
In the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim rape falls in love with torturer".
It's certain Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
On the other hand, the home team dominates their customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream with joy as he resounds the music high, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southern Cork, because the players throw, and find, pingpong balls to the beer cups from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this amazing drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, get distracted by the fulminant question, what the future will come up with.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: Your girlfriend is waiting for you in Auckland, "from a gunshot got the job of your dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already looked abroad for luck.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin currently works as a consultant to IT in Londrés.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the Dublin ESRI Social Research Institute.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave is comparable to that experienced by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
Above all, the economic crisis confuses well-trained young Irish people, for whom so far everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "Everything in Ireland is sinking."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the Irish student union sees a dark future as the government is only engaged in montage and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to get new jobs," says 20-year-old girl.
Notice how his peers range from unremembered practices to the following ones.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On their website there are photos of one boy surfing in Australia and another one practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they pick up a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his country only a few times because he works overtime so that he can pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, since long since the first time he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never that good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes for frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, in the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent funded by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids I have to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civilian engineer does not like the complaints he hears today.
"No one must starve, our situation is, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and counts on his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future stand and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He worked a couple of years in London and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"He's fired, sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to march, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy continues to increase in Latin America, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime causes more concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinbarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues were highlighted in the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the relatively animated mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per annum since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a low of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly more than 25 per cent in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent stated that they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher in relation to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis is likely that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty is only marginally increasing in 2009 and has been further reduced to 32 per cent this year.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent say that either they or close relatives have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
Around 58 per cent agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by polled in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to Waste
No one hoped that the 28 November general elections in Haiti would be perfect.
However, there was a much worse outcome than the fear of foreigners trying to help the country to recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, paperwork thrown into the sewers, electoral schools destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were given up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were " relatively good elections in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The draw is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who hardly has support, if he has any, has passed to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than a million survivors of the earthquake continue to live in tents, great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a people's and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as is clear, so do Haitians themselves.
Advancing of points towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public who has increased their popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, it may turn him into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who remained in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some discrepant members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the bribery government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of trade unions, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández change these policies now?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, their officials claim that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum for growth achieved with a high devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not imply supervision by the IMF, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when she ends her term of office, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you repudiate, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Half hurrah by China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, came to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts on 27 November in what appears to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of sentiments on the continent, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five elections to mayorship, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been inclined by total independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50% of all votes compared to 45% of the KMT.
If it were the presidents, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied up with the KMT in town halls.
In the elections, we could see the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banderitas and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempt to murder rigour fail.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether a man intended to hurt Lien or to take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to bow down to the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with regard to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing will be to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
The President was openly instigation of explicit independence between 2000 and 2008.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai was welcomed as a candidate for the PPD for the presidency, as was Mrs Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relationships with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced the plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates had gone out better if they had insisted Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to present himself to the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen's interference, the PPD will have difficulties choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also perform a consciousness test.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman claims that he will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for closeness is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Nominations to the Grammys: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
You act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bass player and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of jazz since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammys rules that must be an artist who has not brought to the market more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Its ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", no doubt meant a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, it is possible at least to draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated on jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the competitors of Iyer is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and techist John Beasley for "Postootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite thriller in New Orleans and a regular guest in "Treme", from HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which, moreover, leans considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the big camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, Pathways, was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bass player in his band.
Grammy Awards Appointments: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the Best Direction of Classic Albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his 4th symphony, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the L.A. Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphony Orchestra No. 3 and No. 4 Royal Concertgebouw; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and the Verdi "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze by "Appasonably Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
The Pärt Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play it in Avi Avi Avital mandolin, which performed the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The compound with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestra function category for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a Stravinsky recording of works.
Listed instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula receives the approval of the commission of order
The mosque project for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local commission of order after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
The critics attacked the project by saying it encourages terrorism and attacks.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahai, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the valley of Temecula, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"Prove that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who intercede in favor or against the center, practically the same amount on either side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"The United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"This is another planet of the apes with Mrs. Libertad dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans for construction of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families had been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24-943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal to the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes her something very peculiar, although little is missing to be a really 'alien' type of way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online Thursday edition of the Science publication.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbial discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were made public, generated great speculation on the Internet that the report might indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates replacing one element with another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one by another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"Arsenic, however, is different enough to make it not work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, by the way, calls biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, to which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbial grows better with phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead suggests that there may naturally be a life-form that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there was never a proven example.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the early forms of life might have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to L.A. County Sheriff's officials on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Galese Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck that they were spending the night, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are feeling good," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore didn't want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following up on some leads."
The dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in the county at Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the national AKC/Eukanuba championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them at other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
The South of California is one of the stops on the tour of almost two months that the couple performs participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked-in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer's baby, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the stolen van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to begin again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to delete approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to re-launch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The process of restructuring the study began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. investment bank was hired to advise on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million per year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and a bankrupt enterprise recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial tribulations of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-millionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received 1.2 million dollars, will get a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company's administration services, will receive a "successful fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to make a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain balance of your gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mile in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy salesmen, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, cost the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
Moreover, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and over) are toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their belly is tightened.
A hurdle is equivalent to a note, and a second hurdle is beginning to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and over) is the best option.
Taking advantage of Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animatronic wrist plays turn swap games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to convert a car ride into a session with a notebook of passing self-correction exercises.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first major milestone of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7 years old) uses a iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words by putting blocks in line before time runs out; it's formidable for an improvised word-armed competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on his presence in toys, the two biggest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6-12 years) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits at Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle mascot toy.
Slightly larger than the sock of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the last in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 paws of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It's also lasting.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is being promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing low-level orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the massive police officers of the Chinese urban order, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign!"
"Warning!"
Show them, whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pair of perfectly lined black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with blue and white striped handles.
"Personally, I think they look normal," said Mr. Tang, despicably.
"Models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a jumble of snacks, and watched him with the frowning constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the dirty cop a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's low respect for these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat up a passer-by after using his cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, which described how to effectively whip criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a street vendor of sandwiches from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Changguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a warning eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's warning called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the job was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, an almost governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then comes the "and inner qualities" temperament.
The Chengguan women are like flowerers, he said, and added, "besides being flowerers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting this description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job warnings for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured must not show up.
"We can't let a lame person or a jorobado come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his coloured cheeks and a subtle curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His work partner with 21-year-old Xu Yang said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don't oppose their work on a fixed-time basis, they said, because they have higher career ambitions than simply driving out sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces more or less a dozen street vendors who run on foot or on bicycle, trying to sell as many pans or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Fräulein Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn car with locks of noodles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to expose the violators to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were mutinous after the false rumor that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or Chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were shot or shot.
Xindu has for the time being avoided such violence.
But calmness is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where the women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
As female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li totally naturally.
"Most of the time is the audience that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that the prosecutors in the Department of Justice have apologized to Senator John Ensign for the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobby work for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his business had national holders last year and will damage his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "safely pleased" about the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have confabulated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work by lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's business with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find a job for Mr. Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of revolutioning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for his public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, CEO of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to show that the money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "mashing" the Ministry of the Interior on a dispute.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and renounced his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, Ensign told journalists that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate two weeks ago.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and conclude its investigation.
" Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter · Global Voices
There were half a dozen of them "chattering" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes a minute, they sent reports of the horrendous testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process was widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official final, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed writings in the court that outline the arguments of the appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative states that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such a widespread and immediate saturation with exciting details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force adjudication judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate of the defense of Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that the coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a 1966 historic ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of an osteopath from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the court of appeal that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, could be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The issue of Twitter is only one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also state, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them spooky photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurors have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, aged 48, and his daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
Counsel for the defence says that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
Juries weren't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually cast wood on the fire of emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something never seen here in New Haven and maybe all over the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court's policy on the control of coverage weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted by arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes lawyers are pressing that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which repeals Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the process's coverage, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civicism draw a bridge to unite divisions?
After a notable campaign for invective and negativity, a bit of civicism has been unleashed this week in Washington.
Is it a presage of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But for what they all say, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, each one seeking to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting of Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of Tuesday by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and very deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the past two years.
Whether they are taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two parties are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections awaken partisan passions, which then go extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing meeting, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment subsidies to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible discussion on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
"After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
No matter how conscious Republican leaders are of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and cancel the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly reflected in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in certain taxes and retirement age, and the cut-off of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been tasked with one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the issue of the deficit into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been fighting to get close to that figure.
The increased resistance is among the staff elected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least at present few bases or desire for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama about budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch with attention the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and look for compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partidism and polarization are currently greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common points on the issues that still divide them.
An American document filtered portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," leaving a part of the bribes and protection money that directly collects the Kremlin, according to the February U.S. Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libelo on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian television channel they asked him about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a girl, it's a nuisance."
According to the polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that to be the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to affirm that the government functions more as a cleptocracy than a government," the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "the roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they do not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the NGO Transparency International, the country was ranked at 154 (the countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not occur until late in the night of Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be guilty of Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that he is resolving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a lightly lit concrete classroom, with stained and hushed walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemers.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the Red Jemer government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Red Jemer fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia tribunal issued the first conviction of a former member of the Red Jemers, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Twins of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Red Jemers, but they cannot do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Twins was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that was surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, major Red Jemer fighting groups began deserting the government, culminating in Ieng Sary's performances in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Red Jemer fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials from the Red Jemers retained their local administrative posts in return for laying down their weapons, the private soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained few benefits after surrender," Sok Leang said from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-supply."
The current court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jemers.
The court ' s mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This was not very useful to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Red Jemer government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent boisterous afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields at his house on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dark pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She stated that if the court summons her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Jemers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the high school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemers.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemers, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of his story.
But his parents responded sceptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
On the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by an oxidized roof of leafy.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its Uranium reserve qualified for armament
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point without returning last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were conducted classified with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of Uranium qualified for arming a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-qualified uranium) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled over 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an energy officer working in Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of human rights by Lukashenko.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distancing.
It was stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central topic for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government has not set sights on CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not set sights on the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guantánamo on Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram by the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, where it is added that the then government's first vice-president, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, including Spain, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no defense of intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unpredicted stacked," says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest profile possible, although, by being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited ability to influence".
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among governments," Aguirre says.
In March 2007 at lunch between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he said.

To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through testimonies from their family members.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tunez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
It wasn't long before another bridegroom met him.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him he came to live for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the young man stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her a week to Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it can be seen that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musque, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not to have freedom to do what he wants to do."
Then, talk about a message on the mobile that you just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick it up when I get back," she says.
In May, he talks about his return to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be until 19, because I have to introduce myself to a job so as not to lose it."
He says that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"It will be with the one who owes me, that is, with me, and never in life will it happen to me to leave it again with anyone other than my mother", doubtless intention given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on the 10th, is dead.
"César is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand she's with me and she likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand she's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and thus save me some kangaroo pasta."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Says Alberto who sent you I don't know what videos you email, look how you want to find me, you have to fuck."
On 30, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's ahead of me money."
On the internet there are your messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the Prisoner."
"Terror at the Galician (heading). "
The last man who lived with her, a jury keeper, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, from the centre of judicial detainees in Menorca.
The lawyer of his own choosing, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "neither intended to cause harm to the minor".
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor applied for psychiatric evidence.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already seen the general views because, whether or not progresses, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes this training obtains in these elections usually doubles to what it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been fuelled by a shift in votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 MPs (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - now has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief to the front of the Barcelona Diputación, one of the administrations that most budget manages - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility of the PSC losing the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be uncanny for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its vote in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the turning point in the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were found several times.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians detained by police officers in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of the last bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaeda forgery apparatus has been "disabled" internationally and, therefore, "its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that are part of the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that their "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with complete impunity.
The cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operating in Europe, hence that investigations have involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU, similar blows are carried out in the coming days similar to that carried out last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddic Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who headed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "Islamic World Front".
In other words, documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended with the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that it is summarized to give priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with Philo-Soberanist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise on the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself want, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition will abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the talks that these days are holding Mas with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "we will have to park all sovereignist and independentist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to reduce the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax on inheritances and donations.
The details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not by "lack of measurements"
Olot's center owners don't let their keeper kill more than 11 elders.
Managers La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who, while employed there, killed at least eleven elderly people in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's wish would be to be able to accuse the person responsible for the deaths" but "legality and responsibility compel us to take up the procedural situation of civil officials."
And it is that, in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the host, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed to the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, in view of the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through her director, denied this tip round yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been a reckless action on the part of anyone other than the accused himself."
The already baptized "Angel de la Muerte" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by flashing an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control the access of the center's staff to medicines.
Insulin punctures and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to give them death.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he embraced them inside by giving them away as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the coven, not even to the number of confessional murders, which do not rule out superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they are at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
The investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that warned "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have been strongly closed and the actions of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes either, and the euro has hardly given up what is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illegal market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago the ECB asked us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that they will extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you will continue with your bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to obsess on the withdrawal of liquidity measures, let God assist us!
As in their May meeting where they claimed that they had neither contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still the types in Portugal dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change of market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for the hole in Allied and Bank of Ireland have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or become nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension in the face of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the other European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a three-year bond key auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in available liquidity the triple that in March, to expensive types and closes you access to markets sine says.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being it, it must appear".
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The weather does not ameine in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge the El Enebro judicial board on the 16th, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to make use of their majority and make use of the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors was disbanded by five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose contest is noted in the Register Mercantil.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Magistrate of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the case of the thunders within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism guaranteeing the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is rated by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants his five children to, through procedural rigour, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of January 18", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the appeal, once the board has been held, to be deemed to be "full-fledged".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already attempted without success that the judge will convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the estate company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, calls for the use of 51% of the capital according to family protocols.
This is the matter of substance that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which no date has yet been stated.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs car improvements in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a new arrival squire and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, at the final straight of the championship, all gambled for the victory of the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the ability as the final champion's driver, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine to propel its car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce, simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utilitarian cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during racing and testing.
Russwurm explains that the schools in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle upgrades during each season.
Today, 180 high-quality young professionals are working on the Red Bull team, which, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications in the vaults.
Siemens management explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's bolides with the exception of the engine, which is Renault's entire responsibility.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend maximum in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its vaults in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this task is 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of their participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety null are hidden.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago it was possible to assert that R & D advances in cart cars contributed 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology adds up to 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer technology because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 businesses from 80 to 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero set an example of the remodeled shop located in the Barcelona Gran Via, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has worked for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to unveil the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in buying, paying attention, after-sales and even packing".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a worldwide pioneering pilot program to solve the potential problems of HP IT teams under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on stealing a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and vaticulates the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will have a three-year term.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to win market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if discounted those who can leave the bank -, their large outstanding subject, since until now had pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail client.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it is 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be presented by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare at this time to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has detracted from all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's Optima Master Plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three years, but the market situation has made it one more exercise.
Customers who let savings banks escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the departure from the crisis in Spain will "be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even though he believes that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and boxes are paying for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving to the credit price to compensate for the drop in the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a stress on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave the Thursday orders to his network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -see FiveDays of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to go up commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he claims that in Spain "they will require larger sizes."
"The next year will move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters red numbers.
And notes that ROB can supply the market with funds for new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers boast already as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which dampens the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is taking place.
When he started the merger process of the Spanish savings banks, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which in this has collaborated a lot too," the manager pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarieta has stated that the process of concentration is affecting "at the earliest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied with how it is going to happen in the times that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
"Spending from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion volumes of assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities to 62% so that they are much larger to fulfill with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of very unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who put it into question.
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic climate, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "important" concentration process and that "gos as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Tensions in the markets have led to a dual governmental response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed people, until the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined in criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should those movements be interpreted?
It goes without saying that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is again a nutshell in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which collides with that of maintaining the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the South would abandon the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although science fiction now appears, with a very favourable pattern of opinion, close to 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the sister proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments of any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government took out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigor plans and stability in public finances), and what were practicing its European partners, including France.
The second at the front was the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the Greek rescue decision.
He was already the object of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published it were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union Treaties, in order to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, compel private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should be attending the process of EU reform which enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not plan to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if now we have to take action with which he may not very agree, from that date on the former functioning of the euro, it will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the violating countries will be severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another debt- and construction-based alternative, with huge balance of payments holes, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, is simply not going to tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd hurt not to understand it.
It's not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing in these circumstances we could do is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And let's take advantage of the opportunity window we've been given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his twofold manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't seem to be going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of abandoning an overcrowded monetary zone of unserious countries, it cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Assholes like those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax demonstrate ingenious but unwilling to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly hit by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behaviour is anti-sports and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time in removing missing paths to provoke the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next game of the liguilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned with two parties the team coach, José Mourinho, and with different amounts of money to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather a frequent one in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been played by a team from the Real Madrid entity (who, in his hymn, boasts nobility and honor, and who has sometimes been fined their players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of his hystrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions commit legal fraud; for they are, in fact, actions respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question arises as to the type of damage to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that includes the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, an aspect that with these actions was not jeopardized, i.e., there was no violent play.
Another of these items to which the clean game refers is to prevent the team of the violators from taking unfair advantage of the other team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not suit what we normally characterize as trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not made in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most evident in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders derive from the deliberate offences examined.
It seems necessary to note here that the rival is not placed in a disadvantageous position and no benefit is obtained from the same party, since obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated at the first of the changes, and in addition with this performance players perform a penalty game and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor to take full advantage of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offer offensive to pick up Christmas dinners from groups on NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
They proliferate self-suffering celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turron and lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive of prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
In order to finish complicated accounting, this year's calendar (when Nochevieja fell on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reserves for rush days (the 16th and 17th) and just movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on a budget basis.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it by paying for it from their own pocket.
Whatever the juncture, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi of Restoration of Barcelona, Gaietà Farras.
The employer's representative, today, does not dare to hesitate how this month's festivities will be.
"People think about it long before they book."
"You want to go out but you have the alerts on the price issue," he points.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments, there is a collapse of petitions for the evening of 17.
In the Soteras group, there is a real boom in applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance reservation, even since early November.
"We have done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they detail.
In AN Group, which is the flag of El Mussol, Attic, QuQuu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in billing from the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group point out that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that preselect the parties.
Its six group menus have added a Christmas tree, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, like cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that invite their employees back and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the patron saint Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association), his vice president, Henry Gomà, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That's right, the enthusiasm for the festivities hasn't come down, pay whoever pays, says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme raises great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State leaked through Wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns that Pakistan's nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details that they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of atomic security, instead of going up, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is listed by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson, Pakistan, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is contemplated, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferating motive for keeping the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high pace of production of nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
An embassy office in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani army must end with the tacit support of terrorist groups."
At Wikileaks Chief's Hunting
Obama appoints a senior leader in the fight against terrorism to prevent further leaks.
Interpol sends a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dated November 20.
And it's not about the last leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but about the accusations of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator's lawyer Mark Stephens claims that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus things, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free news network to make an arrest -- which must affect the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been willing to respond by videoconference to the Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence-- Assange remains in an unknown whereabouts, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was announced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior leader in the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House as of January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and to pursue anyone from any contribution or assistance."
Further away is Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should make it objective and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, Arkansas ex-governor and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with foxes to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the huge internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without the north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his mask of resignation is insufficient for the likes of the exclaimer Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as diluted today as its own mentor and that it can at all cause the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with foxes that will allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
With stickers, and not by hand raised.
If the caronists want to carry a certain vow of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the chief of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of subjection to his person.
In a number of interviews, he said that one-half plus one of the votes would not be considered to be ratified, but he added, without precise percentages, that it would not be good either a result "to the Bulgarian".
The next to Carod demand more than putting their office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But by not having the majority enough to force resignation, they will try to agree with the executive a road map from here to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that will be put to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to move Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to advance the congress in the autumn of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of the ERC recognized that "polyphony" damages stability and that its goal is to make once and for all the organization be able to wash the dirty rags of doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation said in fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five, out of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces from the Carod sector.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERA liquid at once as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes allowing congresses to be celebrated through elected delegates.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsive conclave left the task for the direction of reviewing assembly at a specific statute reform congress.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend dealing with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors, it can be a good time to resume it and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the account of MILENIO State of Mexico there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.

Along with him the agents found a postcard with a message.
Maintains China’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 40 to 45 per cent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of China at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Her Wei assured that her country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he explained, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot support.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local governments to achieve energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it has abounded, are under way or have already completed a number of multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for changing incandescent focus for savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, exposed, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and plans to do another by 2020, has abounded.
Pasted the Legality Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national PAN leader detailed that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is in his right.
The national PAN leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was tied to the legality and that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is in his right.
In an interview prior to the protest taken by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, if any, to the National Council Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the area of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that he was never at the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which it will have to elect its successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The Panist leader specified that the NAP supports 71 years of dialogue, so "it does not scare us from internal competition; the narrator "we enjoy it and strengthen us," he said.
He said that no doubt the council will be able to choose the best or the best leader requiring National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the shelf "to whom the council determines."
"I have this absolute tranquillity and openness, one of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the match that the party recorded in the past July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it's not time to think in 2012 yet."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the cause of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to the expectations".
As César Nava was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, he called on the prisoners to reflect on the sexes of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks Zedillo and Salinas' governments were better than Fox and Calderon's, they start defending them; they get out of the lock," he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive could make such expressions as those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no biting or much less censorship in the country.
Promotes Obama on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," the U.S. president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is the right thing, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains an open cyber-link with a wider document asking the public to immediately communicate with the senators, since the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vow that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he points.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get a deal at some point at that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's most Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "closing vote" for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senatorial version of the Dream Act or American Dream Law would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when the project's supporters organizations are involved in an intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
That is why the advocates of the Dream Act need to join several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The pleasures of the language was a walk where the participants made a gala of the narrative
"That of Sex in the Language I understand but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger on the plague... "put us in a hurry," the Argentine writer gently spooked the public, mostly of young people, who gave himself a date at the International Guadalajara Book Fair (FIL) to hear this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know which is the "laga", goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers even though clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: "Patience is not my fort, it may be my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who makes it clear to him that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled "Elogio de la invention", where the finger on the tongue is not named but is discovered at a moment.
With brushed with magical realism, it tells of a famous sorcerer, who played the same clouds, it brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a maiden, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel to which they had not missed from the beginning their own chroniclers who told her and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise never had come to tell the history of America with imagination to which it lacked even modesty."
However, he stressed "are the madmen and the ambushers who imagine best" and that is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belong to one side or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
Actually, it's called the "Beerthine Tradition."
"For his inheritance we are what is counted."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero jolted and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the plague.
The Cuban-Prussian pointed her to the great scourge of social violence across her country - and she shares Latin America - which is the product of drug trafficking and drug sales disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs put in place a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
On the night the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the edge of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciences that result in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To own our thinking and own our reality, we have to hue: and nuance means many times putting your finger on the back and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, black and white, established ideas and no nuance and also bothering the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had upheavals in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had upheavals in his career, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the sub champion, has remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive endings.
The sanctist strategist came to his first end as coach at the Open Tournament 2002, when he was wearing the reins of Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 overall before Toluca; later, in the Closura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with 3-1 overall and went precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, Rubén once again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied up 2-2 in front of the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty band he put himself ahead for 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 turnout.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the evil and to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the Timorel when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous end, of which, it says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalty for throwing we were already ready to run out and I think that that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that does not worry you, because it trusts your players: "One never seeks to get to the range of penalties, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no one else and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad play the fate, sometimes by nerves or anxiety to have the title in hand, but we left, that left us something for this end that we hope not to get to that instance."
Romano has in his hands no longer being a champ technician and first taste the glory that gives the titles.
I change rules to get visa
Persons should attend Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will be changed.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer a payment will be necessary to complete the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another payment to get the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with a request (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for trader and investor's visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but only come to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their marks.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the 26 dollars extra service fee.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life finding
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will make known tomorrow, Thursday, an astrophiological discovery, which could prove the theory that alien life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the one responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put at the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings such as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbiome that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way of surviving and of this ability increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is no other way of life, a second way of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD Gesta, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 Laws were not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'thron' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates 'bipartisanism', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the NAP and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overrun again by both parties and thus the opposition coalition ended.
"So far it came (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political preference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, for Congress after being monopolistic, now to be "duopolic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other comrades and comrades to make them more, the convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'botin' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're dividing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked for respect for the deputy's personality, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, let us leave out of 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, it calls out to the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform they have made they agreed, we are out and we disagree with that reform."
Two hundred thousand more coming out for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlan City Council another cheque to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come from the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to you and, therefore, how many more cheques are left to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what is due, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and the latter, 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law points out when an undertaking is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after the publication on 25 July, Northwest published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he received cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Emergency to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist entrepreneurs foreign tourist accident due to bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on several occasions they have reported that the image of the destination is taken care of and that the bad things that tourists find with new activities or routes are reversed.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and turn it around to the nearby businesses.
"Policies don't know what it's like to close a company one day and they have no idea what money is being lost, or otherwise they don't do the work this way in so much time and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not fall into the corrective only," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the Town Hall should change their strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and Venadict of Mazatlan.
"Today, to come the tourist does not depend solely on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
"The due attention has not been given and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, expressed the urgent need for the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan, because they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city daily, clean, tidy and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put in line to make them attractive to be able to add them in the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Requests IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Labour Legislature worthy of and free from agreements between parties and the state executive calls for the Mazatlan business sector, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature has been installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the more of the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to achieve a clean and committed management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordination Council, proposed that the newly-established 40 members of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges she faces.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnavaleric comparators of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
He therefore spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the Governor forward in turn.
"We are looking for decent work and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the signalers who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job creation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity generating foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to help secure the state and update the Alcohol Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
If you are looking for a magician king
Dolls, chariots and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a snitch.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family inhabits a humble home in the Salvador Allende Colony and lives a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no talk, but we sell tangerine and dad... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her 3 year old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'we'll see son,' because he was very expensive,' said Cayetana sadly.
For older children, those who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the campaign Seeking a King Mago, donating a toy or cash in the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out within the framework of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
"They have seized about 750 plants in Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec's spokesman for Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in Sherbrooke's courthouse within the hours of their detention.
They could face the production accusations of Cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," Ruel says.
This police operation involved about seventy officers from the Estrie de la Seguridad del Quebec investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department.
The fight against clandestine migration can be combated without problems.
The Conservatives ' bill, which the Government said should address the problem of pateras charged with illegal migrants, would surely face great opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you're stepping on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we'll see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms which point out that its party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those responsible for clandestine paternals, and that is what we want with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explains Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country like a felpudo."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request the holding of a vote so that each Member to oppose will be explained to their electors later.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity.
Although the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation has been a question since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
The announcement of Tuesday therefore caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party dealing with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad as "a rabbit drawn from the chistera" and as "a last-minute hat solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest is stubborn about avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our view, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a research commission is with Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a poll on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general speaker," he concludes.
He also believed that Quebec could give the same powers as a commissioner in its intervention, thus enabling it to force individuals to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrille is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Act on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being monitored closely due to the heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, there was another land run in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded strong rainfalls, ranging from 40 to 70 mm of rain.
Also, between 20 and 40 additional millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the melting of the snow that has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Civil Security Unit in Quebec issued alerts for the Ouareu and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to be disbanded in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, strong rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several tracks, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The civilian security unit is still on alert and monitoring the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong crevices of several rivers, in particular the Mashinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain set of setbacks to the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and on Haitians, as well as their coarse language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an improperly negative representation of Haitians and coarse language that should not be used in broadcasts throughout the day".
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not infringe the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must report reliable data and not misleading data.
In relation to suicide, introduced Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le Midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Any blame has therefore been discarded in this regard.
The last dispute concerned statements made following the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been involved in a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
CHOI's presenter stated that he had not made any donation to help Haitians because he could not be sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an improperly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of coarse language.
In any case, the radio chain CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which should, inter alia, announce the decisions once at the time of the highest hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The watches of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek combat everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as a UPS employee, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shu in China."
"They will invite the sportsmen who have finished among the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this point, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sand" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to strike with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will definitely attend the great "King of Sanda" Kung-fu Super Bowl tournament.
"This competition is China's most notorious and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It is like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"He who has earned me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semifinal winners face the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts there is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a tender before the most important contract, the management of the project, in an amount of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Gerance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Gerance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, resorting to business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of secretly doing it, now they do it openly," said Quebec MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr Simard raised the matter in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collision with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "honestly" and "with no rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be that the QP apologized.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a competitive bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been negotiated.
Moreover, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial registry allows identifying more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Gerance consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the territory of the James Bay responds to a particular labor dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Corporation (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Gerance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of $449,783,344, including the maintenance energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Ms Normandeau has dropped that the QP is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before specifying that it is rather about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. Green label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer is hardly trusted in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they pulsate messages defending a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down its commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, the Quebec people seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust in the environmental commitment of the companies or environmental advertising of the companies, they reveal the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of the Quebecers take the speeches of politicians seriously on this issue.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of information make 46% of consumers desist from this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they are also distrusting the alleged returns of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell to them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the King's post of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (from their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of the bicycle and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has requested that it commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex from the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy again Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true film vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has accepted to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first plan of action and an application of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been reviewed downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent her a last report ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus are due until 31 December to respond to it.
In any event, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
We recall that the Association of Film House Owners and Film Complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it did not do so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do claim considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of copyright cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film rooms was clear in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its customers.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, Parallel, has continued to screen films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois' beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
He lifts the veil of Canada completed...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the U.S., but at the same time reflect their sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, provide rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a virtually inherent inferiority complex for Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "sorbing silence" because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Legically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, of a party, and even more, of the leader of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 million," writes Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image of the U.S. CBC's drama series.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that during its first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "He has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have been warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee echoed in the United States.
A global plan to renew the enlightenment
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancún a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in a quantity that accounts for almost one third of the additional decrease that needs to be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major specific projects that the United Nations expects to be adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, with LED or "LED" luminescent diode bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be further reduced to stabilize by 2020 the increase in temperatures to two degrees centigrade in order to prevent any out-of-control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), possess a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," notes a spokesman from the head of the UN.
"Call on all Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let the deadline of Wednesday to midnight pass without the results being published three days from Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Wednesday has multiplied in the world the requests that the IEC finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo gang has the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraud" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, has said that the intimidation of the voters conducted by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round, on Sunday, should have put the crane on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations has warned the Côte d'Ivoire political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% on the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent on continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the seasonally adjusted data (CVEs) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the working population on continental territory and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and look for employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2 per cent in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), i.e., 482,000 people over 50, which amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only unemployed persons aged between 25 and 49 have been unemployed, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 0.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the president PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of public funds and property, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions posed by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, otherwise it is to prove them," he had told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, prior to his client's appearance.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to pass on a document to the judge before his appearance to explain himself through his lawyers.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and incarcerated one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done is take care of the landfills that he has to handle.
As to the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds related to their implementation, he did not know anything about them, according to counsel Simon.
In the context of this dossier, it has also been being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but they have left him on parole and has forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and left him free," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, on Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier agglomeration have been interrogated by "abstraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guerini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social property."
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guerini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their companies have served to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that the research focuses particularly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the Aubagne waste, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "expionage", has had in vilo the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the eye of the diplomats in the United States.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
Describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of advising them to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought justice from the United States for traffic in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic issues, François Richer, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly retained in Iran.
"There is noise," they say, "soltad continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "inocence," "immediate liberation."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful with its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often."
Because, once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day on which he will take refuge at the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (€230,000 in reward).
In addition, he notes that Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition from the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which surrounds Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the excarceration of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guaranteed that this was not the case.
Eliseo, states, not only "has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There has been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot nullify the decision," he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
Eliseo's advisor dials a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in some Paris buildings run by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo is not spared in efforts, uses communiqués and "runs" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and check that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials."
To what such "gratitude" is due to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials in private acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to put up with this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he says.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been smitten by premature and demerciful".
When "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praises it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also "to sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Eliseum.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played a "active role in the liberation of our countryman".
From midnight, Korean youth can't play online
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister responsible for the bill.
The online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precise.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people so request, he added.
In addition, it will make it available to anyone who requests free software that allows you to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various events linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world's online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where 58 other countries were faced.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee appoints Thursday to the world Cup organizing countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where the struggles of influence and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emir, Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions between backstage, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is also difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temerii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday, spreading a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have been throwing themselves into intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the JJOO 2012 organization in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Copa de Europa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could lower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are all they can achieve by giving points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're going out to polish their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had the experience of 1994, seemed to have the most logical favorites.
First global economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country appears to have taken advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the 2002 championship.
Another risk: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would lead to Asia being left out of the way by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be adversely affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: evidence
De Gaulle had really doubted it.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy minus yet.
One term in the Eliseus leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be re-candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, one must always appear to doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends stated that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the MPU's deputies, Tuesday night at the Eliseus, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The President merely indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the five-year terms of office to two.
He simply transmitted the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he's talked about presidentials, with a juicy tone, in encounters of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about what will come next."
His statements of yesterday did not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor did he any less.
Comments appear for two reasons.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal has brought to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 was evident is what led many people in the PS to claim that the battle was organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he immediately and prudently reacted to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You will always think you can win," says Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its procurement of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for leaving the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should be completed by the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute can no doubt be allowed to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a situation more than complicated today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis of the European States.
It did not mean that it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its State obligation purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer eloquent on his intentions, indicating only that the State's procurement programme in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main type unchanged in 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to around EUR 1.350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscrete market operators, it would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have acquired securities at a level of €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will continue to purchase (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations under beneficial and lasting conditions ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I don't imagine you'll significantly modify your program."
"If not, it would run the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," opines Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive departure announced during the first quarter of 2011," he anticipates on his side Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such obligations so that the market remains stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no option but to maintain its presence on the market.
"The lack of market investors must compensate at any price and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in returns paid by the weaker states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are set for the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing their indebtedness, or even in stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has the temporary
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations at 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the departure of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the person concerned.
In any case, Tuesday the difference with the long-term German rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQs) had been fired at up to 263 points, causing a certain revolution in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have given the government a cold water jug.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the rumor is that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The bases of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have said for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a period would be opened which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening the mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of European States' obligations has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common target today for speculation.
"As in May, there is really no political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," exane BNP Paribas economists say.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than market rhythm".
Aware of this gap and the dangers it hides, the European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms of exit from the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the marketplace collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFEFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has started a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground.
The first issues of EFSF titles are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative has entrusted Reuters to the agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
With regard to the countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are combined with austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path to that followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase confidence in a lasting manner.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of standardizing public bond markets.
By way of passage from Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to take the purse back.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of about 100,000 million euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could certainly examine in detail European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowstorms continue to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Weather France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snowed lightly on the island of France.
A snow layer of between 2 and 5 cm, between 7 and 10 cm, is expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de Francia and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause difficulties of movement and affect some economic activities, Weather France alerts.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be conducted except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures were foreseen on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "instills all drivers to drive with utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The General Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% in Orly because of the planned snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the island of France reached its peak, billions of transport have been taking place.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To launch this GSP, the State has announced a fund allocation of EUR 4 billion.
On the theoretical level, this amount will then allow the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Law on Finance, which was discussed in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate it to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"Tax resources are specified to be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilise and which will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project moves forward," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment of income creation (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised do not appear in the credit, can lead to a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is exclusively made up of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not just because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism not only rely on what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that was sending the U.S. Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as it was published on Newsweek the previous week.
So why have they caused such a stir in the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, they only say what any cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the Heads of States can call on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just appear that we don't know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of US diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "wisdoms".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Previously, in Orwell's time, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction carried out, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the power eye.
But when it is shown, as now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be held that can no longer preserve its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put in the network any confidential information, since it would be like publishing it in a street sign.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential conversations cannot be expected on the telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my prediction is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelism, but I imagine that government agents who move discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: at the end of the day, the spying attempt at Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances as a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a cable telegraph (telephonic).
The video tapes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of mounting, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to advance or back from chapter to chapter, i.e., to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that communication politics and techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
Previously, the press was trying to understand what was secretly planned at the embassies.
It is currently the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's hats on its financing pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether rapidly unblocked financing promises (called fast start or early start) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to providing EUR 7.2 billion in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was a significant result and was appreciated for what was really worth: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which places it on the right track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken as its reference in 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years ' expenditure or to the total level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), while attempting to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the sharing of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro lent is equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more effective technologies), it is necessary to present a euro which will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated ... As a whole, only the cost of the loan to the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of a rate of interest) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros making 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million); consult the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that so often uses the loan.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France has a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending just EUR 36.1 million, it can give the impression that it spends "new and additional" 420 million, as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term detail in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make the discussions on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Moriset, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by Générations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in the Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as the golosins, were examined in the laboratories for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although virtually all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a weather for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green jews of Kenya, including food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were adhered to with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "contaminant cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimates", says the study.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
