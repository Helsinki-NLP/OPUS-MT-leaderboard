Inflation in Europe has derailed on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after a rate of inflation of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, said the Bureau of Statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, with the rise in commodity prices and the fall in unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the rate of inflation below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, Catch 22 is for the ECB: "Inflation must be deterred" in order to stop having to intervene later on.
In Germany, the 3.3 per cent inflation rate is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The market shares of cereals have increased by 88% and soya prices have also reached the highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 per cent and, last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will increase from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease its direct rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters (the Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly since December. Thus since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (the Institute of Surveys) has never previously found such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would be, because of the greatest determination of the voters of the opposition, more than two-thirds (71 per cent) of support against the support of one-fifth (20 per cent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent across the population.
On the one hand, some of the loyal voters voted, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, with the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious had never been as high, with 41 per cent and 46 per cent supplementing the situation.
After the more optimistic outlook for the spring and summer of last year, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects aggravation and only one tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, found that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather bad than good.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent don't trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without change of government.
While, following the October riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) felt that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
To the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the referendum result would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look only at the same proportion of those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by close to twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, unlike that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Napi Gazdaság Article (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly more than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
The prices, which had already flown into the major food stores last December, have no longer risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the probed hypermarkets exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value in the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of turkey nets, nuts and poppy have increased sharply.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the KSH data (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from 1 kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forks.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle marked with two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forged the bottle included.
It only prevents this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and the least expensive Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its 15 percent daily Cart while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the least expensive basket of this year, we see a 12 percent difference, while the difference between the least expensive basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1 206 forns, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noticed in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Cart evolved in such excessive way that the most expensive basket was higher than 1,720 forints at the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the price of the most expensive basket was more than 1,630 forints than last year's and the prices of the least expensive ones increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By getting closer to the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some diets of prime necessity, the statistical institute has found an increase in prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Cart of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has hardly increased by more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the reports, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they were able to accept the brutal increase in prices by multinationals as well.
In the trade gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important tails formed at the caisses of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers has increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to polling companies not even to reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hospital health conditions, insufficient beds, overcrowding of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals are also saving disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the János Hospital's trauma service.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a hospitalised man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after it had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, the doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacterium in their body.
Up to December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of the people are carriers of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as angina, tonsilitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate under bad hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, with small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we cannot find only MRSA or we do not seek it, Tibor Nyulasi said.
SA is resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is non-moderate
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSAs could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most of the cases are only seen if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The implementation of microbiological surveys is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals are saving disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, to put gloves and protective masks. However, important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in the end of the epidemic, the patients should be away from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, lack of nurses, the sick are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is lower demonstrablely or the proliferation of the pathogen may be blocked.
Government project against MRSAs
The treatment of MRSA is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why we are fighting all over this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Commissioner, author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness
The official record of the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was prepared.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since, who has crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to the state of drunkenness or scorn, announced Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police station crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he shot, with his own car, in Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(Furthermore, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and applied for his retirement because, according to the police report, he was greatly upset by the accident.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated initially with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance of Hungary, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, with a credit contract worth EUR 100 million already signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible amendment of the initial contract once Hungary finalized the details of metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has totalled EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations in accordance with the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the least expensive but which will soon become expensive?
Analysis from Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
At present, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, along the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly searching for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also growing to buy in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the areas of commerce and offices promise the highest rate of depreciation.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradise and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old collapsed houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general to the local physician.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (since last December Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term value added.
The price of the capital's buildings continues to rise as a result of an ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals end Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after official opening, the negotiations of Ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map intended to define the efforts to be made after the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there is strong discussion on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also noted that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss exact figures, but that they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 to 2020.
Another important issue at the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund set out in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of 16 members probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Water Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20% compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the ‘After 2012 Agreement’, and was ready to reduce it to 30% if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries that were signatories to the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members at that time had committed 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the 1985-1987 level, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within the two-year period, if not the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, an international scientific body, which has obtained the Nobel Peace Prize of the United Nations, to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in average Earth temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
British Army units report on the video-sharing site of recordings made during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan are loading video footage of Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the headquarters of the air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is indispensable.
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and reports on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on to the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the actual objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing in relation to the usual advertisements for recruitment on television, communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, and, on the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the soundness of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is embarrassed because, apart from the videos composed and censored carefully, amateur videos have been placed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been packing up for loading these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently using the American's Army shooting game for free download. In this game the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and doughnuts in ministries
Mónika Lamberth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking biscuits and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so enjoyed power.
Public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the department employees who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will feast.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forks and, of the six hundred employees in large, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this holiday, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forks and was organized on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice building (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forks, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company in charge of calls for tenders.
The Gaîté Theatre building was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory.
The ILO building was not only home to the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luke on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
There were 500 people in the ball.
The party began with the minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening was not compulsory at this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a party on this issue.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party for 400,000 forged employees in its walls.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamberth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her collaborators to a Christmas party but to a year-end working meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to a coffee and to eat the doughnuts, reported the press service, the party will not cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to take a drink in the Department of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (MFP) will host a Christmas party in its large hall where 436 employees are expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forks per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No holiday atmosphere planned, the official character is strengthened not only by the minister's presentation but also by the afternoon party time.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas Day will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, in Bois de ville, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forks per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are initiated by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, they communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather together
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute, on Friday, their strike commission which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate strike of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic stops because rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV's employees (common transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The Unions of the League will announce, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike commission will also be set up and will serve as a coordinator of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, as of Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the health funds law, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike appeal.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next steps to be taken.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Fund Act will take place only late at night or at night.
Due to the planned strike on Monday, important stops are planned in traffic: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the companies Volán are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will be blocked as well.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of them is constantly updated on the League site.
Some organizations report an indeterminate strike, others reported a temporary stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, or, as Christmas parties approach, more and more people take the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Syndicats of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for 4 a.m., the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers Union have called for a strike for 2 a.m. and 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Sector Employees' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SEFS will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new approach to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be put in place from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim requires a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the system to pass on the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the Hungarian Guard's activity, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Mouvement pour une miglior Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the society points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsies and non-Typsy people of Hungary".
The Research Institute added that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy likely to lead to this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "the public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of the radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians".
The problem is exacerbated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the Hungarian and international media's activity "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, particularly with regard to confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving the name "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their adherents for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, law enforcement), armies if necessary, in addition, referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was based on the method that, based on the grudge of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on the civil character and status of association therefore only serves to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of these associations in the court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the Hungarian Guard activity is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard, for example, resembles the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many disorders of Roma that have erupted in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence."
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrored" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had been a source of strong debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by certain Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own guard as a resistance signal indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Policy Capital Research, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they inform the public, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
Days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have at all eleven feasts marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as on October 23 as well as the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrated the constitution of our state, May 1st is the holiday of work and November 1st and 2nd, we remember members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
On the days of our national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in the cases or there is only one working day before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in a special regulation on the days prior to or after the holidays.
The Act covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions continuously and in service, through their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experiences most people do rather overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay home for four days.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work for a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, 24th.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can make a terrible mistake for colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that touch us almost more: these are things that "beaut" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we are used to these problems or face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems for others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," a colleague told you.
You missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments for your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool, or a phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember that night you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Did you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be angry at you for hurting their good.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it envelopes into your pocket because it can be embarrassing that there are no more envelopes and that you need them right away.
You're a colleague's privacy dad?
There is no good way to stop pruning.
Who did what, with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone about your colleagues' privacy.
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't be distrustful!
Bury shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You're calling yourself a sick person without a fair motive?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick on the pretext of a heartache tearing because you feel bad or think you need to rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your term missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and colleagues to keep them from being surprised at your absence the next day.
Cooling, refilling, telephone
You're diving into your job, but does your colleagues' blackmail brutally take you out of it?
Have you, without wishing to be, witnessed a phone discussion that you would have done better not to listen to?
Do not bother your colleagues with chills, blackmails, high-voice discussions (that you lead above their heads), beatings of feet, big words or discontents expressed aloud.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not plunged into a project (drafting, design, organization).
You're accusing the others of a fault?
If your work is not done for the time limit, you forget to send a mail or important message, don't accuse anyone for that oblivion!
Do not put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize him if you have made a mistake and if he has presented any inconveniences to others, fix the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at your desk?
Jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Do not jogging comfortable even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We move slowly into the usual mouthpiece of the morning.
Suddenly, a particular song is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm on the sound side.
Music changes rhythm and bass comes to accompany the tones of all time, then a female chorale comes to join it as a true jewel.
Mr2 spread the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the some interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the picture overall and, despite the new fashion of the rock garage tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own path, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dance music and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 cited their first 2002 album among the fifty largest records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole became undeniably "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted as needed, it released a new and better disc.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new tracks for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former Balázs Zságer Pécs group.
We are there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting early in the morning-to-night popular music, began to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine, then (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music remain a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer doesn't say much to me.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be poor and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of the language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially to the west light music has older traditions.
La, people go to concerts and not only young people of about ten or twenty years but also older.
They follow much more closely the changes that have taken place in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested to know who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, I'm happy to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important for concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the insatiable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you'll be no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has a career rather west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other's musical presence and let them deploy.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because there are many of us leaving his group and taking another path.
hvg.hu: On the palms of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many people have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to do a tube so we could sell the disc.
That song means more.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to soften the noise of sounds and the most difficult themes discussed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choir like gospel.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus was composed of the choir of six members, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Boris Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This piece had existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The suite of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I even sang the song that the girls learned later last night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that galvanized me at the time but we sure needed Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were behind the stage too.
Is that what you wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love take us away.
I wanted others also to feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Did that song make you the most work?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and because I've already "done" this record.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Trader risked the billions because of its inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
This is how the French giant, the General Company, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka, is designated by its former employee.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of it.
But it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear him report to the police.
However, if we take care of Kerviel's deposition reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the occasion from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, which were granted to low-income customers or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he put it right.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he obviously didn't keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses that he has failed the reports in order not to be detected.
He managed to duper his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything has anything
Was he afraid of discovery?
Rather not.
"I thought the mere fact that I got $1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where did his will to risk so much?
He reached his post only gradually.
He started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university degree and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won a half-billion euros by placing on the decline of this title during the Londrès attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
So long as you win, where you leave in peace
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As much as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
That is when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to conceal the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer a bank employee.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that Chechnya can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
Transport is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain through these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the National Transport Infrastructure Fund's budget, which next year will manage an amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more effective management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic was one of the new members of the EU's least successful recipients.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released and lived assigned to residence in his estate near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again, is not clear for the time being, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, or they will let German finish his sentence at home, or will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
They were fictitious societies, and the accounts actually belonged to members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to finance its election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
In what way is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
For the current year, it was a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the heated debate prior to the vote on the statement of defiance to the government this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's some kind of paradox.
Whether it is desired or not, each chapter and article constitute the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, though concealed behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media, and that is why he is given more attention in the media.
Political men's disputes are much more of an interest in opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not capable of resolving at the same time:
The first is the significant share of the statutory costs of warrants, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social expenses, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest threat.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the city and commune deficit.
Many mayors often issued, in hindrances, obligations, depressing their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they managed to repay these debts by mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatisations.
Today they no longer have this source.
If only the official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it is found that:
Our economy has been passing through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not lacking.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were indicting the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on the whole, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, in recent years, been unfortunately unnecessarily inflamed.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures, approved last year before the elections, have been eliminated, if a change in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone who will be in power, it will only administer.
By exaggerating, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which causes the ordinary costs to be pushed back by the mandate costs.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated as much money as they could.
If we really don't want policies in power to become simple bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it takes to tax and tax, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, interest rates to which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auctions, and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl, Economic Outlook Group, in his report to customers.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of non-refundable loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still follow," says the chief economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession that could influence economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after it was not successful in lowering the Londrès interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual borrowing, even though the US, Canadian and English central banks had declined their interest rates several times in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a new decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks approach will help to bridge the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the US real estate market.
President Klaus: The debate of environmentalists is incredible
Global climate change is supposed to harm developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the problem of global warming.
The criticism this time came down on the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue, not Green Planet, he stated that the debate of ecologists was incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a word rocket, it's working on solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Interested persons can now read their positions without deforming them.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of monitoring and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, in his view, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of it are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, therefore they are no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
As much as he has experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels to be a dangerous threat to freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this matter two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have not been able to renew their driving licences in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have not been able to renew their former driver's license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit by the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid licences will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their licence to drive especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a fall in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital have invaded applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a half-hour tail about.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issue of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to ask for the issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence, will be liable, as of January, to a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is increased to 2500 crowns.
According to former information, a fine was likely even for a person who was not going to circulate.
By doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driving licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they wish to have.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driving licences.
Just bring it to the municipality or send it to it.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with records from the years 1994 to 2000 are still three years old for renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych's gang, will be in prison for thirteen and ten years, respectively.
The High Court of Prague finally condemned them by reducing their sentences by 1 years and 2 years respectively.
The detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were originally sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, but only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently waiting for only the first instance verdict.
However, in other trials he has already received sentences of more than 16 years' imprisonment.
He cannot receive any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found 19 persons guilty for participation in hold-ups, and the High Court now dealt with 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the accused had questioned the accusation by claiming that it was a manipulative case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the police, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang counterbalanced 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the prosecution, it is about the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Mainly armed robbery, most victims of which suffered a serious health damage, but also the abuse of power by a public official and the prohibited weaponry.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a visor for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already convicted other armed robbery Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men from the Berdych neighbourhood are still being explained in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has for the time being avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision concerning their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured families Igor Veleba wants to obtain from the hospital of Třebíč a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why counsel for the Ondřej Dostál hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the exit of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has ordered the drafting.
We'll check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
In his view, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked for a million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress on different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, although they faced remorse of not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women remain less serene in the face of current trauma and in the face of what is happening at the moment, the contents of the Veleba report are summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on December 9.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave each of the 100,000 crown families at the end of October for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are subject by law to insurance in civil liability.
In the event of a breach, they must draw in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
So far the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were of the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute over the Valašské království mark (the Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had for the first time used the title King of Valašsko, but the project was created by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the actor's former collaborator.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic about Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words “Kingdom of Valašsko ” evoke this actor and comedian to everyone.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's almost ten years' work behind us.
Researching money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They're the ones who want to parasitize on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used for the first time the title valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this did not relate to the plan to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of showing passports from the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally came a profitable business and business, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the society Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be quoted in the passport and even offered to the holders of the balances on the price of the visit of his farm and theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only made use of the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the core of the project was created by Harabiš and his team that devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between the enemy parties today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, inspired by Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as the mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court today dismissed.
What could clear the case is the proposed tournament for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast in need.
It would be something like the Kings parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polivka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also the quality of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to average.
At present, however, its successor to Peugeot 207 is much better on the market.
As much as the SW-named combi goes one step further, I have more to think about.
When I was testing the classic hitback of Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the head space on the back seats.
While there the complaints are over because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's go see it soon.
I'm going to evoke the inside very quickly so I don't repeat too much.
This is a very successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or too short records is overturned.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly in relation to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body dimensions is also sensitive there.
The combi also sees the lack of place above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy rendition.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This does, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the next generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we find that Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to leaving on leave abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the cashier remaining after the reverse of the back seat records perfectly straight, or a very low walkway.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The automobile we tested was equipped with an Otto four cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it pushes well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression that I have an exhaust pipe filled with a napkin, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's look at the tariffs.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that a fairly well equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine rising to 329 900 Kč is still valid.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we have available in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipe-out, automatic rear window control.
In fact, the vehicle costs 531 900 Kč at the end of the account.
It's a lot, but try adding extra equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's only one left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is wrong.
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concerns about the evolution of local education among those who remain.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases in which conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflict between the remaining and the immigrants of Slovak origin is beginning to increase, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Struggles, chicane, and fights between students have moved into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a 10-year-old student with a bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him by racist speech.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant carried out by two adolescents.
The young girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we came home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," he described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went to describe conflicts with immigrants in the struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the original and the immigrants is beginning to be strained.
Seventy thousand Slovaks who have come to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can be done if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering on the beach pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list solely in its entirety, but enriches it.
However, there is only one island on which you will find even more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described her as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected in the early 1920s.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings have pushed and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s, were circulating on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the entire American business show and politicians left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still travel to Havana, since the jegouli and the already imported fiats have long, in such a salty and humid, rotten climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is markedly decrepit, nowhere else around there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have pushed not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also to small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still proposes a fantasy that is unique to the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The rod had returned from the plantations spread in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and so it is possible to see small locomotives in which the contemporary are not only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or Havana.
Or remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales west of the island is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone floor.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks climb up the bottom of the valley, and, having taken fertile land in their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is probably grown.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness has become part of the beauty and the city-window character of this small town.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain mass Escambray, is a place to such a point that still in the 1950s there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We weren't building anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which cheers after sundown and where the music only fades in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way in which it leads.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern Cuban school, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Columbus (in reality, it has been born about a hundred years after the Columbus trip) and from the hill where the former castle-fort is held and the current El Castillo hotel, you can see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Truces and the island of Isla de Pinos, Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
Only, as we're just saying, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment affects, according to the United States, the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going as it should, and representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States called on NATO troops this week through defence minister Robert Gates to engage in greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the intensification of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only constitute part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC channel.
Eighty-eight percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. Army, the most intense of the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, located south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, including about a quarter in the south.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has today made similar remarks.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is passive
In recent months, they have also been among the countries involved in the conflict on the question if all allies are able to do their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the demands for combat they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called this week German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan exploiters discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document completed by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
The debt burden of over 84,000 Crown bonds is borne by each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
With a better-than-planned evolution of government budget savings, the department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The Czech State's debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
During the nine months of this year it has thus increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As from June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the debt of the State from the beginning of October.
The debt burden of more than 84,000 crowns rests with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has seized over 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that, due to a less significant deficit planned for next year, one could cross the border of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance Analyst Vladimír Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and is mainly generated by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, rent, direct loans or, for example, by borrowing from the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt has increased from 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
This year's external debt has increased from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called marketable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the rent securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand this indicates that there will be a matter for negotiation when the pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than expected.
As a follow-up to the government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, as a result of a better-than-planned change in the state budget, the department reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is mainly made up of the deficit in the state budget which is clearly reaching 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the originally planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion for pension payments, the financing of state-owned securities for 43 billion kroner and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
Today she was in court in Khartoum for having named a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in the Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students aged 6-7 to name a teddy bear Mahomet while any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
She was punishable by whipping.
This 54-year-old British institute at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with defeat of Islam and sedition, under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"There are names out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favourite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself was not bearing any labels with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching in the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he said it was only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who described her as "very attentive to her students" and "never speaking about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most widely given name in Britain, he writes in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
Of course, this is an interpretation issue.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiation session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria without having been able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"There is no immediate violence but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "clear tensions exist".
End of mediation on December 10
The ombudsmen of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90 per cent Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be over on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not resolve it in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "was part of a past that led to killings and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade, in particular, said that it feared a "domino effect" in a region that was still weakened by the 1990s' independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
“Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
Journalists Fatmir Sedjiu replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be “in consultation” with the Westerners.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed immediately to enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old contentious between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "the terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities," Bush said, recalling both parties to their obligations under the "road map" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This appellation covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees fleeing their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
In turn at the rostrum, Olmert committed that future talks should be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort should be made to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States" which co-exist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his interview with Saudi capital-based Arabic speaking.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in each of these types of acts, official versions and rumours oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the National Police Inspectorate (NPIG), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in surgery but in patrol, and she was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to move on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circulated "with a very lively allure".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right," says a policeman.
The control of alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle proved to be negative.
The state of the car (formerly defrosted, windshielded, bumped bumper) is evidence of the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicides and non-assistance to persons in danger" at the IGPN, which was conducted by the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor states that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the policemen's version, namely that this mini-mote arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the treads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were stuck as long as the police car managed to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police officers would have left the premises very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also “all serious misconduct” regarding this point.
"This is one aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows is on the stage.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to heal them," said the witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw “a completely stubborn policeman, who was boxing.
Two others tried to revive one of the youth, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that the people who were present with the unexpected situation of the youth, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
Always according to this witness, the relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police."
They also performed heart massages in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police have not provided assistance to young people.
These youths were rescued.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police reprimanded the first demonstrations on Monday since the start of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
They fought back by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers in the Supreme Court Bar Association called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties gathered in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president '' urged the people to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the detritus to those who took an oath before Musharraf''.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds''
The Pakistan Supreme Court is directly governed by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
She was to decide in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the Presidential on October 6, at the indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
'Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings,' the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president ''keeps no more''' after the establishment of an emergency state, said Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by November 15, following the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of Armies.
Over one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unanticipated births.
Even now, more than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is not foreseen, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unanticipated births.
The different methods of contraception, such as the pill or sterile, still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, says Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed for a better "fertility mastery" according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20-44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See month by month for a couple of five and if possible in spring, season deemed to be the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, indispensable for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that has accumulated records due to its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, the rapidity with which it was imagined, of the tools "knived" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece that was soon to host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for workpieces.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move a solar panel module weighing 17,5 tons, already present on the ISS, to post it to its final position.
After moving, the crew began the redeployment of solar panels from the module, which have a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged about a meter by a wire that got stuck.
Deployment has been stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally to take out the Discovery shuttle control, then go and repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of Nasa's best spacewalker.
Large, resistant, very nice, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was responsible for "operation" of the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the faulty cable and installed some sort of "cut-off" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" that remained close to the sas and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey rod wrapped with insulating to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "knocked" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS sanctioned in the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply to the Paris stock exchange, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 as a result of delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which condition the initial flight of the aircraft.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, is ''between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus'', announced the European manufacturer's parent house EADS.
Because of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to burdens related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a television message to voters on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of a united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to transceiver by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of choice during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish for honest, most transparent and open elections, unbridled elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from being counted.
She's reporting a pressure-hit campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there was "never such a dirty election even in Eltsine's time."
Following the crackdown on last weekend's demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains prohibited from visiting according to her lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspended legislations there are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the first round of the Presidential, on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to get to know each other.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot hold a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, to the legislatures and the president, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has taken a time in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as much as this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "grainfully renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What is good to think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of 54-year-old Tamara Cherednitchenko: “What good is thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
Heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi archives, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archives, stored on 27 km of lineage in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were only available for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., on an individual and adjective basis, upon the request of a former victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of the agreement by all States has been completed, and it has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these documents to the public because of the sensitivity of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for compensation.
Again in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to await these documents," said Fr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Antisemitism Research Centre at Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A far-reaching free trade agreement between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a 450 million prosperous Europeans market," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of India's first ten products exported, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regreting that bilateral trade has not yet "not reached its potential". The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England expressed its concern on Thursday to alleviate the current return of credit concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer.
"In order to alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its projected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE puts the cash market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These normally take place within a week.
BoE adds in its press release that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on the day-to-day basis with its base rate.
The daily interbank rate was Wednesday, 5.829%.
The three-month rate has been 6.6% higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England's market money had been accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the book's price to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more discreet discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS bids on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounted to a rejection of the text.
The text was part of a "socialist niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), with about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS national office, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the recovery of floating ITPP, a transport cheque or rent management.
Upon voting against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the sitting was adjourned following the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the entirety of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with someone who has, no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said C3's Charlie Jones at Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival should be held from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts approximately 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones from C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and laborers with the Fairmount Parks Commission to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
“We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been enraged into politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Heavenly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resuscitated Lollapalooza in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having set foot in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a peasant festival, while ours are instead taking place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a peasant festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are sufficiently interesting to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the host capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Award Promoting the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays to Montreal when nothing other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is one of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the "Governor"?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer those that they will judge the best," he says.
The race at the festivals
For the time being, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Coast, whether it be Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting the Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is posted in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end stock exchange rally? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the year's end, investors are already rubbing their hands while waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not as certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in the stock exchange usually has positive behaviour.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since in view of the current context, uncertainties in the markets, at least in the short term ".
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking on momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leakage to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not exempt from volatility "especially because one does not know the impact of the likely decrease in Fed rates, given the high level of the brute and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, sales manager for BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing," the expert assures.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert says that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the constitutional festival (December 6).
Analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Invertis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be triggered based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
Analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date approaches, the electrical sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that increases will be due to the bank and industry.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they put in it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that the other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be prominent in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions in December was a month's kiss.
The authentic rally of the end of the year took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds computer on its year-end rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday.
The Popular Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a big change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10am to 8.30pm.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to adhere or not to this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the Popular Bank is looking for.
Attract self-sustaining customers circulating in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street businesses chosen to open up.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but about renewing existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the clients of the different streets.
In this way, hourly amplification is accompanied by a different design of the inside of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but staff hiring, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experiment was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía branches of Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, that open even Sunday and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value in Borse of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect ternied his joy: 'What hurts me, it is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have less decreased', he said.
However, it emphasized that in a small market, 'we have less fallen '.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a progression of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The value of the company's stock exchange controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who surrendered 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange amounts to $3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Dias) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to exceed the 1.000 million gross advertising revenues, as stated by Giuseppe Tringali, the managing adviser to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
For this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Bourse is the important pay out that it has maintained to date: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those whom we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market now gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, to 7%.
This is due, as a result, to the decrease in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of Antenne's earnings by 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.

Ibersecurities recommends that the two values be purchased based primarily on its significant return on dividends and long-term sustainable potential.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on November 1
In parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation that would ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies in order to make the markets work effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial advisory services for both specialized social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets can be added to multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management, and obliges them to keep records of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by CNMV.
In passing through the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that the titularized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management took advantage of to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economy can have 30 years after in 1977, the Royal Decree delimiting professional functions reserved for economists was approved.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its product marketing and attracting services from new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized Consumer Price Index increases by five tenths per month in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as the one used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information on which it is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the definitive data that will be disclosed on December 14.
"The ICP will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, stated that the 4.1% increase in ICP in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue to be "relatively high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has specified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November, "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42 billion over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12,000 million (16,800 million) since it entered into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit to the Bank of England.
At the time, he had accumulated some record deposits of over £25,000 million, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of the money that the Government had offered and that it would maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with its business brand Virgin Money, needs to capture about a quarter of the income of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get these 18,000 million pounds remaining up to the goal of the 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnate group, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock appointed the Virgin Association's offer, in which three other companies participate, including its favourite to save him from the bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today at the beginning of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (Popular Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, the current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the mayor, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'meneur' of this plot.
The officers continue to search municipal and Council of Urbanism premises and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out within the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban plot of corruption, discovered earlier this week, was imputed.
As the Chain SER told the Member's lawyer 'of the People's Party' yesterday, Juan Morales was arrested on his way out of Morales' home with important documentation relating to the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged cashing of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company of Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to be at the head of the candidacy of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the ex-minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono is "one of the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist group who will preside over Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who released his decision last November 15 not to present himself at the next general elections and to abandon his political career in the fight against climate change in academia.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped urging him to return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, even though the citizens already know who will be the Economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over Congress, in a "transparency act".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only local in Madrid where we can't speak quietly and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions was interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "I know how to do" and he did not want to do as if he already occupied his position in order not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might regard as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subjects to persecution without mercy both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, contributed decisively to Spain's leadership in the European Union's non-implementation of the Kyoto protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy economies will be required to do, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costsome, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of businesses and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed so dangerously to Zapatero that he hurried to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the election campaigns that he does not speak, that he does not denounce and that he does not demand, embellishs the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only a purely virtual contracting party which does not claim that we are cycling or cooling off with the margin.
Mayor and Chief of the Local Police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have informed today of the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hall, where at this time many agents met, who also presented themselves to the URBAN municipal councillor's office and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made on Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that Galician Nuaria could build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana was investigating.
The first six detainees have now come to a judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently the parliamentary autonomous party of the PP, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a registered real estate agency in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the UCO Group of Urban Crimes of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was therefore arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the town of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Catholico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

If they want it well, we will let the Book of the Month rest, see if during this time it comes to us in the mind of other ideas.
I'm already thinking of something.
Life is change.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent gave us the comment of yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA information on top of education in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day when it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The contents of the Philosopher course questioned public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the school in Jokela.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsinki Sanomat and he said that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the basic compulsory course of Philosophy in the high schools."

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Penal Code of crimes about downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a punishable offence from six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store of less than EUR 400 is considered as a fault only (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for up to 1,000 euros is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the trafficking of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month to one-year sentence (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and CD trafficking would involve a six-month to two-year term.
(article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real world then someone exaggerates.

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
That is to say, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depends on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted with magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed".
Researchers observed that when both people became receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died-, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at liberty.
Their names are on this list, the documentary of which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, 'the Carla list ' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who continues the criminals fleeing and presses on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance do I have?
Motor vehicle insurance, which covers the driver in the face of adverse events, involves an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be provided or use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the insurance price, which is based on a variety of factors, such as age, sex, age of driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the actual use, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices according to statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of injury than they are cautiously concerned.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages at the time of a contract with an insurance at an affordable price, as may be the low experience in driving and the seniority of the driver's licence.
Although the ideal to be well assured is any risk insurance, other more economic options exist.
The most likely drivers can opt for a risk-free insurance, so that they get the coverage of any risk-free insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the amount of the disaster that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe, the online insurance mediator in Spain.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid injuries to the extent possible, as this will affect the benefit, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic tariff that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses ", clarified Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers when they contract with insurance, since the rate of damage is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose a risk insurance with franchise.
"As a rule, young people cannot take advantage of the experience gained prior to an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation permits him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be people with the lowest rate of claims, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk-free insurance (may be EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more casual conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to afford themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchises," Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance is preferable (the latter is EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the missing point to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it is used by Italians to be first and Scottish to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the six-day Shakhtar Donetsk, who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass it in front of him.
These two matches of Group D will be played one week before the sixth day ends, since the Milan AC must compete for the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month looking for a place for the final of December 16th.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able only on this since with nine points the game is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope to rank for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would return only to the Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic loses, to rank for the eighth finals in order to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began in Vancouver, Canada, in front of approximately 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice ' (Melania Brown), 'Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melania Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the history of the group was told at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincided with the launch of a new album that resumed their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Vodoo', which EMI published in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls were on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience who filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', which was part of the group in 1998, "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings changed, feelings for Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that in time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate it a lot".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, on TV CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, a babysitting army was waiting for them.
They count five sons to her.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will be exhibited in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23rd.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine sets off the alarm.
A dispute over the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are channelled by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two, had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company providing gas, failed to reach agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbor Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas transits," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuation of gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine."
In January 2006, the last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of supplies of Gazprom to Ukraine.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve controls on its extra community employees to check whether they have previous criminal charges, said the Monitoring Committee.
The Reviewer General's warning, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas persons employed.
Its report has nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks carried out correctly on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Reviewer General has conducted checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having darkened with his jeep, in the gates of the main terminal.
He was a member of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer general's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Control, thus allowing employers to undertake controls in various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified well, this is not done every time."
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health would carry out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He stated "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities have declared that 1161 overseas persons, most of whom are doctors and nurses, are employed.
But the Reviewer General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems relating to the identification of indeterminate contract staff, who could choose whether or not to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current health authorities' control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are entirely adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for non-ocean staff in the health service.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government allied to the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas employees.

The 50th-year-old director, having filmed films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' suite, The Crane of Crystal.
Winston said he was proud to receive this award in honor of the star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."

Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrorist Plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed arresting 208 activists involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smuggler's cells.
Al Qaeda supporters staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees would appear to have been complacing the murder of ecclesiasticals and armed forces.
The government requested the clergy to do more against Saudis headed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda activists fighting the Allied Forces and the Allied Muslim Shiite government in the United States, considered heretical according to Saudi Sunny's tough line.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiasticals have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by appeals against the Saudi government, pro-Western Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy-supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medine organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing militants.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European orbital ship showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation allied to a slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a warm enough temperature surface to melt lead into it.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor at the physics department at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand the reason why Venus's climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, even with a living surface."
Uranium enriched sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to it as a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the debate on You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the democrats for their position in relation to the global warming.
But this time, the questions and the answers reflected a lot of the conditions of the Republican party, which is a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube's clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-on-one, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to telephone when they would hear funny things: Governance raised increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor, of using illegal immigrants in his home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote "amnesia" (providing illegals with regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this issue.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they have started to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least in relation to immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, allied to concerns particularly raised by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears about the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the contents of the Bible in their entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about believing in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another intervener asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in a pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - declare that the death penalty is painful as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The rise of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincided with the recent provocative research of grants conducted by Libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during the debate on Wednesday.
These two are emerging from the void, thanks to the fact that the two party's protégés do not agree to decide who is the most known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifiated the party in good time and convincingly thanks to a message of success on the American scale thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which he was hiding; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra successful foot finger.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than $650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have fought well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went back on his election project, foolishly insulting British intelligence, claiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The buyback of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, showed a flaw in the guidelines and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals has launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military spending: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, David Abrahams' suspicion of mad donations; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former chief of vigilance) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is boundless towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, nor even govern for a long time, when he risks the suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of the ministers take stock; the press look for bad stories; and the government becomes on the defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Northern Rock issues and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was the chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long investigation into the party's funds "money counting for members of the House of Lords," voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr Brown is not as tragic as she looks.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim or scam.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realize Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies of always, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Mr.Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big granters of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr.Abrahams' programs, without knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the person responsible for the grant collections that had spoken of doubtful donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing seems to suggest that he has been aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made have been made as a result of his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative failure of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power was based on something he knew well, resorting to an investigation committee on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the police's responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Living Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a supporter Mr Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters back, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see hot fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators aim at the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could amount to $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Tensions are clearly visible.
There are increases in costs and insolvency rates, which measures non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States regarding the personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall in the bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses to credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt amount that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 issue volume would be 25% higher than last year.
Direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debts now that fair real loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species rather than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, debt by credit card would become a priority to repair the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and more flexibly to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were supposed to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared innocent of the seven charges for alleged collusion fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich himself despite their employees.
They are due to appear at the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all pleaded guilty to having committed a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC group, have become famous throughout Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 led to Fastow's understanding that he was the subject of the government's inquiry into the collapse of Enron.
The charges against bankers, nicknamed the "three of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to turn the bankruptcy proceedings.
By the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary bank for £ 1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper for interest in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually, that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have received $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year prison in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British men were released following the payment of a $1 million bond each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national corporation, on a bankruptcy basis in December 2001 after years of accounting scams, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in loss for pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former General President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of her death due to a heart attack last year.
No way, no way out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, amounts to $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats as they are more of a family-owned aircraft or for the president of a society."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand at Gulfstream, last Friday, at the Millionaires Show, an orgy of encouragement for consumption, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians in their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars such as 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was writing a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to run in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar from the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the largest worldwide spending.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH's president, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(the World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She participated in the exhibition for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Grupo Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the salon on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents posted on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grasped her dress of high seam like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to do the tail in the plugs to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canyons, Mövenpick ice creams, customized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand for Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall painting by Raimbran on blue tiles, hand made.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much in accordance with Russian standards) have already moved from glowing logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, millionaires, millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are surveying the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the King Koil Bed CEO, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold thread.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also declared that he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals for it to look like a wheel of roulette.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of hide leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr.Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr.Karapetian said that the expression "Russian millionaire" is not on the order of the day, given the increase in the prices of real estate here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if not in the present case," he said.
"there is more that you could think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company set up four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with bulk of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire trade fair.
Passersmen arrested to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their furniture, in the midst of this false wealth or impotent a few million.
"you see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Karyev.
Non-accredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving's eve when Ronald Livingston looked at the glass bay of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then comes the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Livingston, a manager of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unaccredited cosmetic surgeon, that the police have not yet identified, residing in 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms Arroyo's death, but they expect confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take some time, but which should allow for the resolution of this mysterious death that has attracted the senior ranks of Newark police.
Ms Arroyo was the assistant director of the police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Board, and that she left two 14 and 11-year-old sons, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, speaking in the Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
"This is an opportunity to consider."
"investigation is continuing."
The authorities said they arrived at her house about 3 p.m.
and have found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms Walsh could not confirm that Ms Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Miss Castro's house where a wild rose-tree lies in the narrow front cemetery, and a Dalmatian was barking at the back.
A blue canopy called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two bikes all ground hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since he arrived in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate to the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"It said, "You have to pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and again when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the effervescence of the world stock exchange.
The shares are exploded from both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the terms of the credit, further reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, #2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence in part "reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
If this harsh turbulence persisted, it would increase the likelihood of a later rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed to calm Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been accentuated by the statement by Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that she will terminate 650 people, i.e., 4% of her staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the betting loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in Londrès where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In Londrès, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% at $6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the high demand for a sale at the auctions of monthly funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and injecting further funds into London's financial markets causing credit tensions, caused the British banks' monthly "Libor" tri-monetary borrowing rates to grow at 6.59% since last September, followed by a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces an appeal against the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who were exceptionally there to assist Peter Moores, coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national, at least part-time selector.
The one who won't win the n°6 will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to get Bopara to emerge?
Is this just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new managers who have obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted; but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine a cricket's fair level unless he is given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time it must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 front-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the primary Cricket of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent marked against Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning to innings of the 88 test in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, which at 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan again in shape, demanded his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket floor and he exaggerated when he recently ended up on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He only reported slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor right on) and call Alastair Cook, his teamman who looked at him from afar, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his filamentary allure allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the man is just one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be the one who will play this weekend.
The buses bring people to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has found normal.
Some have come back to fight the activists who have driven them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in official government bus convoys, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called to inform him that the U.S.-aid militia allowed Al Qaeda to be hunted from the west of the capital and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have attracted the growing accommodation of the capital since the American troops arrived, and with the view of continuing training of well-armed "groups of citizens" and working with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion that everyone felt about the visa for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government not to give visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The fall in violence can be explained in part by the fact that Sunnis have been chased out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is concern that a sudden flow of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state conducts vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that there is a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-desiration, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saarland, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by double or triple degrees.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saar also leads the country's children to higher-average higher schools - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," said Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtained their education in a vocational school, so the Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Thus, the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one-third in recent years.
That's why the Ministry of Sarrois Education forced higher schools into an engineering science marketing campaign.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to begin learning earlier, the last year of nursery is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether the performance of students improves sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the share of at-risk students decreased from 29% to 20%.
In total, however, the Saar has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And in spite of the sarrois, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez rules watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will pick up the half-hour clock in the South American country.
Chavez in the meantime becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated to him, because of a new law, the watches will be set less than four and a half hours from the universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I cannot, because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who has been looking forward to constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the negotiating mandate on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "hipped in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain Chávez is also in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ring is furious in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you stop) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant calls from the left populists and who told him to shut himself up.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong situation, according to a forecast, a real less-value salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a Hans-Böckler Foundation calculation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their pay card in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low growth of wages, the increase in tax on value added and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research on Environment, in the newspaper "Bild".
New burdens could also be incurred on unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected decrease in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial assistance, according to the SPD politician.
It was learned on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and hydrocarbons had increased the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to the next.
Venus is the infernal twine of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today provided proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus burst at about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, the lightnings would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life was there, it must have been at a very old date in history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should not be much living today on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal twine of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, who looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimension, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, since no probe was on its way to exploring this planet since the nineties.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed to be at first glance.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the windstorms already known at the north pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the south pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysics Space and Physics Italian Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The star-qualified planet of the evening or morning spins around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: one Venezuelan day lasts 243 Earthly days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost into space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has established itself on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the party quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama in Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized SPDs because of attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and is the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this question," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should keep a significant balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows it too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly reported his discontent with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for that purpose outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, about the CDU's "frontal policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao now requires German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, so supported the Chinese position.
The words and acts of the Dalai Lama would show that it is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets by violence, demanded the Minister of the Interior of Germany.
Barrcades that burn, breakers who shoot at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious youth riots in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not become a part of us as well and is disengaged from violence.
We must take this seriously," he said at the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would manage to get away with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From summits of integration to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble notes at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian settlements, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts by the German government, this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat emphasises that the share of unemployed under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
More training should be provided first and foremost.
Kolat insisted, "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that social control in families took place in Germany rather than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must be careful."
Youth should be encouraged to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter overflew the area with projectors.
The authorities in the station reported three arrests as well as a few cars and trash burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces has been calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the trouble overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The chancellor's utopian entry shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and that there's nothing left to wait for.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his desolating speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel by a hard and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it made clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither a real interest nor a lack of feeling about the country's problems.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a hardworking politician, who flees into foreign politics and who even stays there in the afterlife.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it is still very pleased with the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of oneself - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it cramps at all formulas, that growth would affect people.
Thus it destroys its image as a pragmatist, who solves the problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the wake of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-paid workers?
He's got a few extra sentences left for that.
In this respect it is revealing the number of times it makes lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to speak a precise half-phrase.
She titubs in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican candidates to the Presidential, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of candidates has already erupted on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refugee for the clandestine," Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This against him by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a havre for clandestine people" answers Giuliani and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates go to attack: as the republican base does not have official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use discussions on CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than breathers.
"It is with this sort of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of questioning that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again present.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney, and apologizes to the base and the television audience for having been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani goes into a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as chief of the armed forces, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of army domination are over.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his post as Chief of the Armed Forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bowed to international pressure, especially that of the United States.
Eight years after he took power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil state.
Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and of the West by withdrawing the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Soon after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on October 6.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Waziristan of the North in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The supergroups of Germany in the seventies are replaying: the three members of the Harmony group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return there were recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable, and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, throne in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed throughout the auditorium, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius runs on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has assured some misgivings among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is based on the collective memory of the pop, but in no way is it so sustainable that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Much more so than what is called mistakenly "Krautrock" has always worsened in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo Prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work, German pop interrogators were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Snow! in the eulogy, the astonishment no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of self-inspection and the transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-funded label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly taken off in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as guitarist with Snow!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Roth followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an ancient farm of the Weser, a 16th century ruin, they lived like members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommun I", where Benelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
Soi-told was in the trash a choral phony Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retint Harmony far from it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following was called "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve on its own in search of self.
The "Live 1974" CD that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks he remembers.
Rother at that time wished to force Harmony to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assumed his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herzen" (flamming hearts).
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the Griessem Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
Snow! had already been found on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Granted publicly as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's sentence is in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of base wired tools are used for the formation of legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvizing.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to pull instruments from sound inouïs through instruments with self-built effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
All three of them in great technical feignors.
The choir of the house itself won't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice time "Aaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been a rock.
The roots have been less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), technology (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is now no longer irritable by this now.
But what goes most self will be carefully covered on stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or give you fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Deathless Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But they both don't convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of nonsense or on the contrary they are too larging.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certain Karadzic and Mladic war criminals still hide in the Balkan mountains, but it is right there, in the most lucrative backcountry of the war in Bosnia, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because many too many nice and futile roles in movies with feelings for women and many too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism pleased him to show themselves.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to still look at "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the chase (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of eyelashes: at the bottom, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and the film industry were not as kind: a man who has had his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this strength, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Deathless Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless suite of films missed in the Balkan War.
From "Deathless Peace" one can make the trial quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of nonsense.
This remains a kind of "Almme for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the background there has never been a real good film on the Balkan War.
The history of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard at once), at another moment a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the cynical deserted one with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also assign him a romantic adventure with a later murdered Bosnian.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, succeeds that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have failed in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court of Crime against Film Logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they have to be exceptionally agreed) not to drive hunting in a rather intensive way due to secret political agreements.
But the good intended and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem from Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Comparing, I see the veins of the bloated forehead, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of film on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good movies on South Africa yet.
What is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a field of mines, he then pulls out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Archette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good holocaust movie with Schindler's list.
Some films have yet to mature - those who are worth classical works on Vietnam today "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today too simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each box arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this pleased writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" have in fact become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we don't want to be good at making good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcasm artistic look away from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change."
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will still reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvests criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has hit politics and the economy with virulent criticisms.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The chief director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivating forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invited the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new longer-term starting point, "which took as its starting point another modified agenda".
The Mayor Ole von Beust remained in his previous statements on Wednesday, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide a candidacy for the Olympiads, but the German Olympic Sports Federation" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, about Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the span of time that we had planned up to 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, Von Beust said.
The Sports Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects already now," said HSB Günter Ploß's President on Wednesday.
A drop-out of the candidacy would be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have described Hamburg's candidacy to the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" at the Hamburg Olympics.
Fédération des écoles supérieurs du sporte (Fédération des écoles du sporte) had first in recent weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The Mayor's SPD branch blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad map and excluded the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for the Small Grassbrook to have an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a later use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "factor Event".
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidacy would have raised a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' crates.
He who connects Sweden concepts and wooden boxes, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Stockholm Type" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal researches of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm result today in a disappointing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten museum made a gift in 1995 at the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate in the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and healing productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - of the hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum wrongly claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have given it to him.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 only for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had already died on that date for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and ponted, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals instead that the painting was directly applied without a layer of background on the stratified panels, using a roll of paint - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These caisses were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," says Moderna Museet Director Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six caisses in its collection as copies/exposure materials."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, we've had an inexorable silence.
Manille's Rebel Soldiers Surrender · Global Voices
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers left, the same ones who had retired in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power had recently attacked the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been stranded in the building for hours.
About half of them were held in the courts on Wednesday, due to a failed attempted whore in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to eclipse suddenly with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who were normally supposed to monitor them, apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power are closing the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillane said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in charge of the elite unit of Ranger Scouts, said that other army units soon wanted to join the march.
The critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by reproaches of corruption.
Since 2003, Manila's finance district had been the scene of a mutiny attempt by about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke about 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts to putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
The United Internet has participated more than 20% of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of social capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versailles.
With this step, we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, said on the market.
On the day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed in the Stock Exchange 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million euro for 31.1 million euro.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a spokesman for the United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP partnership to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation at Freenet, and not use their right to grow 18.49 percent additional at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all the options open, especially to increase participation in the Freenet SA, we have learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficultly predictable on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding had until now a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four per cent.
The right to purchase the 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
