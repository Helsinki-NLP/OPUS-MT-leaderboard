The American Federation of Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sports, could be better served, and that this can be done by moving from one side to another, rather than by making significant changes within our organization, than by withdrawing accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could go unnoticed for so long and adopt any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional disposition.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was brown chestnut on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called rachis, but show other characteristics specific to the feathers – beards and barbules – researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulating or displaying the temperature. Researchers suggested that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not the thumb of a chick.
Scientists point out that this is true of the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young person.
A car bombed at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The Governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police said they suspect an alleged activist of Daesh (EI) as the suspect at the origin of this attack.
They found that the Sun worked in the same basic principles as the other stars. The activity of all the stars of the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossby of a star, which is linked to plasma flow.
With respect to magnetic inversions, the smaller the number of Rossby, the less the star is active .

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in a envelope a pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers checked his identity, the voter threw the envelope into the urn and signed his voter card.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each step of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a "did not finish" (DNF) during her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish at the tenth place of the group of women seated with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first arrived, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth arrived.
In the category of women in skiing, four skiers failed to complete their journey; with regard to the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to rank.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we recovered his phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had a hidden face when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none was injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The route of the accident was temporarily crossed to allow rescue services to extract the driver from the Red TT Audi.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh court.
She was in custody pending her trial and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait had been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish pictures, etc. of suspects."
The Office of the Crown Prosecutor, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comment will be made until the indictment is brought.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed included the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel called for a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agreed only for a period of five years.
The additional pest control test shooters were to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its efficacy assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday entered a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the extensive protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of iPods were reported, causing six fires in total and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 aircraft-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed him of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "unserious".
The department responded by calling the report adjourned by Apple "really regrettable".
The Earthquake struck the Marianas at 7.19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianne Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in Northern Marianne Islands.
In addition, the Tsunami Warning Centre in the Pacific stated that there was no sign of a Tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took hostage Hong Kong tourists by turning their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza pulls with his M16 rifle on tourists.
Several hostages have been saved, and the death of at least six hostages has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Philippine photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and started a doctor's career.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature delivery during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the infant's lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... even more...I love her and she will miss me... I hope she lies in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 per cent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was to be born at 100 m and 200 m free swimming and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome his pain, being forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number ever known.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets are forming, and more particularly how the Earth has formed, since comets have collided with it a long time ago.
Comono, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month that legalizes marriage between persons of the same sex.
He described rumors as “political chattering and stupidity”.
It is believed that he will be presenting for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly at shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground radar systems, enabling air controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the game can be played in private without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated much longer, following the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinion, Geospiza fortis, and the conical immigrating pinion, Geospiza conirostris.
We can shape the gold in many ways. It can be rolled in tiny pieces
It can be pulled in fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in leaves.
It can be made very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand painted images in books called "lighted manuscripts".
This is what we call the pH of a chemical. You can manufacture an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
The humidity on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water hunt in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorin in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization the toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women used to share.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and other goats.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free cats) that eat the smaller prey, many more, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task given to each felin, preventing him from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called mutes.
The mutes are composed of one to three adult related males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, with their families consisting of a large number of sisters and girls.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to the other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
Balanced athlete, tiger can climb (but sometimes hard), swim, jump long distances and treat with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (Gen. Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roaring of the tiger does not look like the broad roaring of the lion, but rather like a sentence whose words would be shrieks and glarings.
They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost every animal that the hunting ocean is much smaller than it is.
According to scientists, the oceans trace and find the animals to eat (prey) by the odorate, reinvigorating their journey to the soil.
They see very well in the darkness through their night vision, and they also move very furtively. The oceans trace their prey by relying on their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population of which they are born (for example, if they move over a mountain chain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return back), they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, they expire).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes based on plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The masosaur was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing, except the other masosaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth as razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palace, so that everything that crossed its path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had the tongue forked. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosauras, and he could even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not large against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual holiday dishes, including boars, loaves, snails, as well as blondes, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food by sitting on chairs, rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while eating their meals.
Antiquity's Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggurates, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of the Hebrew family were in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and so named it — by travelling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, ecstatic tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasury, you may think that a treasure card was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is a back registration of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Declaration of original independence dated 4 July 1776” could be read.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three-quarters of 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was simply added as a label.
The disembarkation of day J and the following battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupant instead of confronting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had freed the south of France and headed for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work together, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilist", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in some ways, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-States are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and an equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it reminded state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second largest team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey roller and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, the Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelling".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European browsers passing by mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of Aboriginal cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal zones of Taiwan and declared it the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the first Sino-Japanese war (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it granted the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the hall of the three windows.
Most of the complex's neighbouring buildings have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continued until today.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film age.
It's still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera photographic sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest of the entire number ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is highly mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while providing protection for the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the rotuary.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for that reason.
The church's central authority has been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted and codified international law through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters in order to prevent ships from ventured into entire maritime areas, thus threatening even neutral ships.
As this tactic caused only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its boundless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a sway for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from reproducing in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous director) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of showing the different times; every step of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the time of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place among many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of the Chinese Antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the classification of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other working classes repressed by other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of La Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not really easy to find, even if we know it exists. When we got into the cave, we're completely isolated.
Above, nothing can be contemplated other than the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the interior of the cave, we can only see or hear very few things of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by Egyptians during the third millennium before J-C, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honour of the deceased pharaohs.
The Gizeh plateau, or "Gizeh necropolis", in the Death Valley in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his women and his family.
The "pushing" symbol looks like a V and the "pushing" symbol looks like a staple or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A top-down arch usually produces a softer sound, while a bottom-down arch is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to register your own trademarks with the pencil, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical motif, and therefore it is generally necessary to respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Mrs. Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of salesmen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their chariots.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interests of the obligations issued on behalf of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super-profits of the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place during the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – a period of history in current Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place according to a process that goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are inherently conditioned rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
Massive car possession also has a greater impact on road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injury.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered to be that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury epicenter began around the year 400, and lasted up to about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that the Crusaders were back in charge of gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style experienced its peak between the Xe–Xe century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western modes could blame a delay of 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest progress of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is a farm that is used to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system, using preserved seeds originating in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers used subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, injury or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "fear" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by persons (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within the limits of their physical provisions) almost identical to those of the animals that have raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners discover new education such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, through extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster family placement is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usage and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors that promote the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal Involvement" and "Continuing Relations" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is alleged that it can be detected if a person is able to interpret micro-expression correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities for interpreting human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes the variations expressed.
Separation and recombination alter the variations between the two basins for each generation.
In savanna, it is difficult for a primate endowed with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs in amino acids from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
By contrast, food of animal origin (fired, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of proteins containing all vital amino acids.
All well considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way that the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process that consists of intentional awakening during your sleep period and a short period of sleep (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without awakening you completely.
If you find yourself reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based possibilities include drinking lots of liquids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is present. Each person has the opportunity to find an absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (light energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is thanks to the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and there would be real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans have become almost obsolete from day to day, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of vessels for the carriage of goods is by far the most effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boots, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Mount Zagros in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing spaces, often cared for by workers who were most of the time children or teenagers, similar to the most famous term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always taken place today.
The "wagonways" were built in England from the sixteenth century.
Although the rails for cars were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who took them to reach higher speeds and to draw more loads than on the slightly more accidental roads of the day.
The crucibles were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a strip of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans started to walk standing two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithics, did not walk standing as usual.
Biped specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to alleviate the sufferings to come.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets from there to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall court on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which made him read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people see them as dinosaurs being giving them wings and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and filled with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that are encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough to prevent immediate diagnosis.
The best evidence of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic domestic drugs or chemicals.
Check the label for the first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed-sticks, which are very suitable insects to parasitic humans.
Reductions, as well as bedbugs, are nidicols, i.e. suitable for living in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (PES), making it the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their interests, nor in the interests of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make a adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, the experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a working cycle for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
Hershey and Chase experience was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the portion of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation, park visits and ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the Orang-outans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to their workplace and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, each is somehow connected to a transport system based on and supports passenger cars.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of movements of drivers and specific vehicles between two points, and of interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented in an approximate manner.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relations were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
Not less than 20% of the water that throws from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Gizeh pyramids were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were now well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was land, water, air and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it has also issued the theory that the latter become new substances to form what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All the material is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new forms of writing has led the pen to a more confidential status and to more rare uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a screen.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a core of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Kind of like you were making a hill climb to a heavy cart. By dividing the core again, then releasing some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is finer at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the next side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to go up to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature towards adulthood.
These theories examine what causes some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the theory of the hierarchy of Maslow's needs and the theory of the two Herzberg factors.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum is to try to remain "the good boyfriend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, entrusting responsibilities, and keeping others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unknown individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things in its own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often results in differences between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact of their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to see the annoying process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative new process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of damage, injury, tumors and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly known as science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The aim of artificial intelligence research is to automate by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been installed in several home computer and video game software.
Hiking is an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outputs. Students can look at the old objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while remaining seated with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to think about a trip and share his experiences with future generations.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes the situation change.
As students are often the most critical public, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "enforces students to better know the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the public encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When good use is made, the blogs "can allow students to build their analytical capacity and critical mind: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with others and expose their own views on very specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and the North, the Muskoka Region and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessential nature of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparse and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs have also brought the practice of Islam to land, and this religion has spread widely to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at the time when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the path of Cape Town that links Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended to any woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to have an alliance (which should not look too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviour they consider to be harassment. It is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the refusal of men's advances, and be not afraid to hold well (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed it had rebuilt it and baptized Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajina, pottery, groceries, narguillas and bibelots of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of volcano Nyiragongo, which has buried most of the streets of the city, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks of plunging the gorillas of the mountains among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to move to Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Tombuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" show on the PBS.
The city strongly contrasts with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located north-east of South Africa, along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the south border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific fauna.
This is one of South Africa's best known amusement parks and is considered to be South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation rights for the park.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that provides access to some South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong territory and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a gleaming bar graph, which is reflected by reflection in the waters of Victoria's port.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the seafront of Kowloon opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the plains of the north bank.
This is the place that the British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, covering 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not only made up of mangrove marshes: they also contain some of the last remains of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gang plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one-third is covered by water/trafficking areas.
Sundarbans has been a natural reserve since 1966, you can find about 400 tigers of the Royal Bengal and 30,000 deer spotted.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other shore) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave from 6:30 am to 7:30 pm in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock is a bridge to houbans. It overlooks the river Oyapock to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint Georges-de-l'Oyapock to Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical release under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened for circulation in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, had survived mainly thanks to fishing, hunting, or picking.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "giant province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Association Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the book of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank of the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a currency commonly accepted everywhere in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if British and American currencies may be accepted. Talk in advance with the owners to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical area and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely descend below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it feels colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really rainy and dry seasons: precipitation is about constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, however, they are wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must hold at least 100 metres from the bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, bison, elan, orignal, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, then avoid transporting or cooking odorous foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly famous naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were flown, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Chief Tupua Tamase Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city during the struggle of independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north in Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the center of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. The swimming pool is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the water from the local tap without danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "creme coffee" is foreign. A short black is a "express", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many journeys on the reef are carried out throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay special attention to security warnings.
From October to April, to the north of 1770, the meduse-boxes arrive near the beaches and estuary of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and they would escape.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
The advance reservation gives the traveler the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transportation from/to the airport, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also book for you if you need time to think about the offer or get you other documents you need for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decided to camp on the spot, and most felt that this was an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are over on the main scenes, other musical shows can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, make sure to check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them on the spot.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer for free alcoholic drinks. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain necks should consider snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On cold and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During the blizzards, it can fall in very little time of snow enough to block you.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfalls or dustfalls or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and circulation is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, especially in the savannah, with the aim of assisting in the striking spectacle of wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
The lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A safari on foot (also called "walking in bush", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of making hikes, either for a few hours, or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you have booked your flights and your accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a delicate situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most of the cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing approximately 7,000 yen.
Wet clothing can be made to dry more easily. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be loaned, even if there is no iron in the rooms.
If you don't have to iron it or if you don't want to wear some ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the tissue overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities it is enough to boil water for one minute; in others it is necessary to do so for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a renowned company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals they do not know in their region of origin.
Pesticides may contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread of venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, are generally not considered as parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops have an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from excise duties and excise duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, often passing through isolated land in the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight curves predominate.
The speed limitations displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict respect is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbours, Austria.
The fruit pastries are usually there: apples are cooked and cooked in pastry year-round, while cherries and plums point at the end of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often particularly well married with a cup of hard coffee.
If you want small but copious pastries, try the balls of Berlin, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, the Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods from central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, the Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanais prefer to be peanuts, peppers, sugar (in particular Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The striations are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: indeed, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a horseman is projected from a horse, but has a foot caught in the skirmish, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow a skirmish to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From tops, the mountain views are impressive. Alpinists from all over the world continue to discover new paths that can be found on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
The downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding to unravel a snowy track with skis or foot-linked snowboarding.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called ski bums, who organize their entire holiday according to ski in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years av. J.-C. !
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but it does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rough terrains and which require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think about the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good condition, you will be able to travel distances a little longer than on foot – but you will only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backsleeve on damed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In conventional circumstances, travelling across several countries implies that several visa applications are required and that several passport checks are carried out.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat as a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the countries members of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define property over 100 as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where they are located; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Craft products may be regarded as antiques, although they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of livelihood in the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Sami were not involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived in fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as animals.
Today, many Sámes practice modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather that may cause damage, serious social upheavals or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographic, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are storms, tornadoes, marine trumpets and cyclones.

Travelers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather affecting their destination area, knowing that this may have an impact on the routes they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should be given vocational training.
An Internet search for "Hospital Environmental Courses" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes a training in the handling of weapons.
While books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who plan for a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have the documents valid for their return trip.
Governments' willingness to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Scans at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to pass the scanners by preserving their privacy and dignity.
Retreading currents are currents that return waves that break on the beach, often on a school or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow into deep waters can be formed there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim counter-current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the water, swimming back isn't more difficult than usual.
Try to target a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible that depending on your skills and whether you have been identified or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is less long), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty in adapting to their original culture.
When you go home after having lived abroad, you are already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your culture of origin.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the background canvas and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded boiler of a volcano still active offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the sea of Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the mountain range of Ellsworth, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel chain, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without cellular telephone networks, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephones.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as it must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as shipments that have data transmission needs at a distance and telephone.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who plan for a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn by travelling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before college, without compromising their education.
Often, following sabbatical courses abroad may in fact give you better chances of doing higher education in your country.
In general, registration fees must be paid to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for pleasure navigation. The "Country of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
The pleasure navigation is a national pastime in Finland, due to a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, this is a single case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is between one and forty).
Most of the Baltic cruises are characterized by a prolonged stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while coming back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you go to the ground only with cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not located at all near the seashore and no visits of this city are included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and horizons, especially if they have never stolen before or experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed: it is not different from the fears and personal fears that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of planes and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well paid for quick deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repair, the issue of deadlines is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts relating to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to do this was to send it as registered baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or in business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally speaking, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is unnecessary to seek reductions for business class seats or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their tariffs in knowledge of the cause.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but recognized by no United Nations member country.
The economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent correspondence platform.

Don't forget that you are essentially visiting a charnier, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or not Jews indifferently.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not unload the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that they are the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The National Park of Plitvice Lakes is densely wooded, mainly of beech, spice and fir, and has a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as the brown bear of Europe, the wolf, the eagle, the hibou, the lynx, the wild cat and the big tetra can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have the shoulders also covered.
Most of the monasteries provide stars to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and in addition it has vivid colors, you will have the right to a smile of the monk or grandmother at the entrance.
Just like men have to wear pants covering their knees.
We can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but as it is not washed after every use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Majorquine cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.

Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructure located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first feasts of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the aristocracy near the Imperial Court.
The plants have their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove them, if only "one".
If you visit a strictly equipped garden, the collection of "specimens" will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you will be able to buy almost everything you need when you arrive on site.
But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to a strong radiation of the sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.

There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often organize a Easter Eve on Saturday evening during Easter weekends, the congregations often burst into the party at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands did so initially by water, swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance that separates them from the continent, mammals could not go after the trip, making giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of the man in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the boreal auroras, for the sky will be almost dark all day.

The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than the culture to which Western people can be accustomed.
The costumes are classic work clothes, and the employees call themselves by their family name or function.
Harmony at the workplace is crucial, as it focuses on collective effort rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the consent of their superiors for any decision they make and are supposed to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
