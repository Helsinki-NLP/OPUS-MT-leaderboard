A triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where President Wilhelm Molterer's current position is seriously threatened, suffers particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the votes, has ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Again in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on SPÖ.
However, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary party leadership council.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election which remains most likely, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the reinforcement of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated) on a common government, which even provoked sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but the Greens lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Clearly, no other party crosses the four-percent limit and accesses the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may become cold
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India, accused of illegally collecting cockroaches, could not be resolved, according to the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations would follow.
The minister declared it today in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, which was carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mr Mukherjee said, with the adjournment of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could apply for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner is speaking in the same direction as during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which he may be grateful," said the Czech Head of Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister mentioned.
He also said that such assistance was already provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize him," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said at ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister avoided the question if he had obtained the promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he said.
A Czech arbiter the struggle for the seabed
It approaches a wall electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes from time to time.
The ardor to work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found, but also living organisms for the moment unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
Wider bottom than firm ground
The coastal states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of what is known as the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, exclusively claim all continental shelf resources.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its basement is considered to be continental shelf, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the said exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The country's request to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive prospections and metries.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, they were only successful in the last three countries mentioned," added Mikulka.
Australia's success, the first to have considerably expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced global retaliation.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the size of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they project it, inestimable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the oceanic background, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is attributed by an international institution established by convention.
"Let's not mistake it, the seabed is not a Klondike," said overwhelming director Mikulka, pointing out that "his areas are precisely defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the countries of Eastern Europe within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" common organization.
It was obtained in 1991 under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moved there, it's kind of a tatra underwater replica.
"It is possible to extract from it on an expanse with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a conclusion.
She recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had called for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never went into action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted from Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both the federal army specialists and GSG 9 officers, the federal police air squad and the federal criminal police office, as well as the Technischen Hilfwerk logistics experts were at the scene of liberation.
As the Ministry spokesman communicated to him Monday evening, the German forces were not finally required, the hostage-takers who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"This has fortunately not happened so far," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Interior.
The aggressors had taken out in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbaptized into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived safely and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to "Bild" magazine, the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off aboard an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the American Congress has recently failed the $700 billion long financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was tearing into the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the House of Representatives of the United States rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls by the President of the United States George W. Bush and politicians to the leadership of the two parties, the program that was to break the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded property of this heavy $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debate, had called the MPs to a favourable vote although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could captivate.
He went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning new serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, approval and the House of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the coming months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, German travel thirst remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) told Berlin Monday.
According to the GfK Markets Research Institute survey, increasing numbers of reservations already dominate the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the RDV was entrusted.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Reservations for travel since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the USA would be particularly requested, the DVR said.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one Tiers.
Apart from this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought-after destinations by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are very requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an organized individual journey".
Consumers can save money, among others, with reductions in advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months were also very narrow so that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski on a continuous basis, beer in litre pickets and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, television animator and wears a custom-made tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used to.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that at my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and living normally north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse Square, everything is half worse.
Each or almost wears a tyronic suit or leather pants; no one seems to be blasé or ashamed - it is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume harvests a few strange eyes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian tells me that I would have barely attached my apron: "On the left, it means free, on the middle, on the right side, on the right side, on the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my back loop to the left.
"That's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others do not give themselves so much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and carry simple felts, on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked rear-train without being invited there.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He thinks it's gorgeous, with an elongated "ooooo".
He tells me all this after he relieved himself of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire mouth everyone thinks they're a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild fishers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, a band of rescuers run on the party spot and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Instead, nurses intervene in packs - always by four, they drag their civvy covered in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors of the beer party: we go empty there, we get full of it again.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunkards under the sheet are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," screams one of the rescuers in response to my question and then disappears into the mix.
Accident victims identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday after noon accident, in the city, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European Powers were looking forward to entering its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphora, at 20 can be, of Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is located at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its corners, such as some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The entire building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant of the game of imperialism, wished to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the German Turks and Allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is sabotage.
Since then, it slowly falls into ruin, engulfed in the depths of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to emphasize the widening diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region around, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, shaken on noisy rails, whose frequency reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new century, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically made of stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastries in which middle managers in men's and women's suits meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
He's got a suit, a tie, and he even has a Black Berry.
"the purpose of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with each other.
She was supposed to do both.
"but, here at some point, "did I ask if Turkey should not choose?".
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost all of the people with whom I was able to speak, have recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore both an advantage for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe that is metaphorically travelling on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night without sleep, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphora, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Having already started his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21 years old, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old - refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to him, whether Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remember how many Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades of 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them has ever disappointed me and, a few times, they even inspired me
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
This is what Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End came out of, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "The Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
This includes some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it must be emphasized that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation is placed on the market.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter time frame than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most popular car on the market in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than a million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The heads of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the exit of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to win in large part the decrease in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand's leaders hope to finish the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimetres in addition), its width 1.69 meters (two centimetres in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1,52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a petrol reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double-bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in addition to the first generation chest.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Huda Jazz 1.2L safe is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improving access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, a share of the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 liter engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm torque at 4,900 tr/min.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100-horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, BR23C represents the development of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the eyes composed of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles within a distance of two metres and a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forging his wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to this data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of prior manoeuvres, that is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about memory giga-octets, or even megabytes."
This represents the first because of the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars within ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being hypothesized.
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The jubilee aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a teenage game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry in his round table of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a strong drop in its stock exchange course.
A week after disclosure of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price chosen is 19% lower than the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28% above his current course.
However, the Morgan Stanley action lost 6.79 per cent to $23.07 at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained John Mack, the U.S. Group CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The details presented Monday further show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares in Japan for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "we thought that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary actions.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover us."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities Morgan Stanley 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within one year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has said that he has "attached" his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange rate melt by half while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was flying.
This cost went back Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers bankruptcies and Merrill Lynch's ransom, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivarian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, he was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of polling stations and one count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", which placed it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday to Monday night.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the seat of Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), dealt with a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the State's power over the economy, reserving it the "planning for development" of a country that is essentially living from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies that its emigrants send.
Ported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and would be running a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use a Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the fans of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, next to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the rapists," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoeir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been smuggled from one cache to the other by 35 unknown rapists.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
One Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fires has taken place, and half of the kidnappers have been killed, the others fleeing," said the one responsible who requested anonymity.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without further detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before yesterday, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the shippers were on, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement, (SLA-U), which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking place in this election campaign.
So much the better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the amounts of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are hungry?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon Castle alone in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 history, heritage, archival and genealogy societies are concerned with searching for history, preserving with three under the monks of private archives and preserving archaeological vestiges.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers at our old forgotten stones and cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Hollada bank, as the first European banking institution in distress due to the snowy effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partially nationalizing it. The three countries bear, with a sum of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary as well.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition manager.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been amplifying for more than a year, for the Fortis bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its holdings, including, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, that it acquired last year from the Dutch ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertiginous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty of outside Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion American rescue plan, of being the cause of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the paper has already been slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as the new CEO.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the customer circle of the bank and no agencies were attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken bowl
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their purchases of medicines.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of information concerning prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is up to you to entrust your chicken to a fox." - Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions for drugs in Washington Post, recalled.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of injury, the health status of the client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not even provide it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they had learned the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided with pharmacies, data on the purchase of drugs from the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from, and what his health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer other than the paperwork. However, tiny problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program, it is found that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be an aggravating risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed into data research and analysis, and they must request permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are constrained by the authorities, even if they have not been penalized for their past shortcomings.
Recently, some companies have also been dealing with laboratory results and linking them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use becomes increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the broadening of the supervisory circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question whether the person concerned is truly free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurances do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So, in the end, chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India multiply trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where there will be a major issue of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
In fact, they did not get too attached to this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply trade by two, meaning an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from $25 billion to $55 billion, this does not appear to be too ambitious a goal.
In this regard, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and so air traffic will also be able to increase them in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India as the EU's first trading partner, and on the other, New Delhi, which is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this issue was mentioned.
The completion of the Doha business cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce its release of toxic materials by at least twenty percent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as the need for a global market to be made at the next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now visiting the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to press agency information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Salon international du Livre de Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Exhibition awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honour.
It will be the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, in the Buchmesse Pavilion 5.0: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign books of authors gradually decreases from the total Italian production, in particular from that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane wreck, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, while he was flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
Debris were found on a plateau at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County sheriff John Anderson overruled the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was found, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it is well Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Yerington's Fosset take off in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, money species and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had circled around the world on a plane without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having stolen at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you're not waiting for.
A 4x4 out of the ordinary of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest born off road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this area.
Just because of its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from October 17th.
Thus the advertising campaign that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi display project, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the stereoscopic car, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the picture, the auto comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative technology Remove8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes tries to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group " Ultras Italy" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, until now, had never created any major problems.
He never met the opposing typhus.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) of Campania and Apulia joined.
They had three-coloured flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a tiphosery of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans: all nominal, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to go to a stadium.
Four Italian typhus who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, the typhus could be arrested or identified in the messes purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids going to Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is, others may add to the first 150.
"We must turn off this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves in this way," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of the game of the national team from Wednesday to Lecce"
In the Apulia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday, the Cassms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which deal precisely with stage problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm held during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a very unpleasing way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the prefect in Trieste, where is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory's number 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to Mameli's anthem: those here too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite..."
