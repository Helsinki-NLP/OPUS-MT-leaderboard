Cumulative rapidly progressive incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and especially intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more severe disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progress to a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The issue of 5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom, and to compare them to those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of cases of COVID-19, therefore taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of notified cases from each country by 15 March 2020 at 8h, and compared with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally followed those of Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs even though countries are at different stages, from variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly from different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to the saturation of the health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by VOCID-19 associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC rapid risk assessment on VOCID-19.
In view of the fact that the cases so far have been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, such as what occurs in the affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases may not offer sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately, if not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to your homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects the elderly more than the young, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which develops quickly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined on the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and their disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "enemy public number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we found two times highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of CoV in the documented history of human beings.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan, on December 31, 2019, to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CoV was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, the contagio of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, which was considered the starting site of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
To date, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.
Since the situation is rapidly worsening, the extent and final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, especially in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in groups, especially in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope joins its angiotensin converting enzyme receptors 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidil peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and, as a result, membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the particles of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in ultra-fine sections of the epithelium of human airways.
It was found that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 joins the human protein ECA2 weaker than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the crypto-EM structure of the human ECA2 of total length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the complex ECA2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening medications to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bats similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of the species and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes transport the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the pangolins, elongated seal mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete tests are being expected (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV manage to survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with a humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivation of the virus.
Overall, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system by means of standard recognition receptors (RRPs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll receptor (TLR), NOD receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receptor (RRR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV may inhibit the functions of T-cells by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for the fight against viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly more with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, for the most part, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective time of quarantine based on the most precise period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, choriza, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease symptoms.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever and/or symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis by imaging of the lung, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that the patients of the MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of the patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the patients of the COVID-19, which consists of the higher mortality of the MERS compared to the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with SRM.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By February 14, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, the mortality rate of SARS until November 2002 was 10% of the 8.096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and with SARS-CoV regarding its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity for propagation than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have travel history or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to extend the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral blood white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the dymer-D level, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count showed progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present irregular bilateral shadows or dark glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ADRS).
When ARDS occur, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumothos, the formation of the hyaline membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MRS.
The detection of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 through polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which has not been derived only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and essential to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol to use the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, at best, palliative treatment for VOCID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with expression of ECA2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine cascade is a systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of T-cell immune response; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF block; JAK inhibition, blinatumomab; cytokine 4 signaling suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause severe side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for cautious use in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored with attention.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have cured themselves of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from the contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of blood antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured of COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate in excess of the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma demand is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a worldwide epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, their effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on CTM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, the TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with VOCID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of patients with VOCID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with western medicine and the combined treatment of western medicine with the MTC.
It was discovered that the times necessary to recover body temperature, to disappear symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by western medicine and by the MTC than only in the group treated by western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by western medicine and by TCM than in the group treated only by western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still await more properly controlled tests at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel a great fear of highly contagious and fatal disease, and quarantine people also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, symptoms of psychosis, delusion and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Compulsory contact screening and quarantine, as part of the public health system actions against the VOCID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people with suspected disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to stop the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and infected people for susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate powerful and lasting neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the beginning of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of the MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, VOCID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the outcome in health of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to experience acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that the age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are present expressly in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other questions for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as a combination therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the epidemic of COVID-19, many patients suffer from high stress, as they undergo long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS characteristics.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or only causes mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial phase or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the epidemic of SARS.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the world population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle corneal rubies of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new identified virus may become a cyclic influenza-like episode.
However, promising indications occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was kept under control at last.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker as to its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is found below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which creates a new possibility: that of oral-faecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, coworkers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent droplets of fluids of a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or being attached to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series no. 1860s) protect against the inhalation of Virions with a size of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the verions being able to penetrate it completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the size of SARS-CoV, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use isolation dressings to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone washes their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a great alert to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020 only the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproducibility among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left the people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since all they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals, instead of waiting for formal reports from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its initial stage, instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently issue targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The epidemic of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing of this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sensation of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects the elderly more than the young, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which causes a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than patients with SARS.
This explains, in parts, because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA trial for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of bats similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original host, of the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to Questions Nos 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a world pandemic, disappear like SARS or have a seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to many others.
However, regardless of the necessary efforts, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation have propelled the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused mild disease, like a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought about the CoVs and have revealed how lethal and devastating a HCV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCV is of enormous use.
Most of the HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoirs of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
The investigation of CoV host interactions in animals may also provide important information on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of the disease by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and single-stranded RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in an electronic microscope.
As for the structure, the CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two overlaid open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some ancillary proteins of specific lineage are also coded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most of the HCoVs and is subdivided into four strains (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidences showed that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of the species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coriza of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of today and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new HPoV of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause agent of the current epidemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of zoonotic sources of HCV provides a structure to understand natural history, impulsive force and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission interspecies to a new host.
We also review the evolution trend of HCV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the HBV-229E strain B814 from the chorus of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals including turkey, cantongo, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in lines of pulmonary cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and subsequent serial passage in mice' brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other pathogens of the respiratory tract, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCV-229E developed a common soft cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients exhibited severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8.096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspallators", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of the peak of viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatinine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased numbers of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he's been identified in Holland, he's scattered around the world.
It was estimated that HCV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crude.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in a community, it was reported that HCV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
In the same way as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four Community-acquired HCVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently been reported as a cause of severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary propagation to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with SRM also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to SRM, among the diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases, of 34.4%, which made the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known to be retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuous epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to the confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can evolve rapidly to acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
Firstly, the incubation period and duration of the evolution of HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCVs acquired in a community way (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are more observed during infection with community-acquired HCV, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, mild or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired and in SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can display seasonality, such as in cases of Community-acquired HCVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All Community-acquired HCVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop severe diseases of HCOVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the higher the length of stay of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other measures to control infection.
Several years ago, the four Community-acquired CoVs circulated in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance of migrating to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four Community-acquired HCVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as the HCoVs acquired in a community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than the HCoVs acquired in a community and less pathogenic way than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reservoir animal host or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses an ancestral direct relationship, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is generally well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
In the same way, a reservoir shelters the HCoV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adequately adapt to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
A HCV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Macadamia (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxinim on live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for the SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate amp, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a narrow-linked bat CoV, named CoV HKU3 of bat Rhinolophus related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% of homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV with the exception of the designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.
It is known that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) of humans is the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from faecal samples of bats uses ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as receptor for entry into the cells.
Intriguing is the fact that serum of patients with SART was able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the ancestral one with the closest relation to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and that the bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptide-peptide 4 (DPP4), for the virus entry.
RNA-dependent polymerase sequences of RNA from MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to homologs in betaCoVs of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for specific neutralization antibodies of the MERS-CoV, in the same way as camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal rubble of dromedaries, increased the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the usually mild symptoms, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels experimentally infected with the MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
However, there is still a lack of responses, since many confirmed cases of SRM do not have a history of camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed plausibly to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that host SRM-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% homology of nucleotides with a bat's RatG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus finis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is very large to attribute a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate storage hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless near identical CoVs of bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be configured among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also house ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into SARS-CoV-2-like virus enhancements in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of receptor binding (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study of patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual configuration and healing to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolim is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts.
However, currently, there is no evidence that confirms the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related betaCoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolim, the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 share the highest genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-argument is in favour of the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an impulsive force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, the zoonotic origin of the HCV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
phylogenetic evidences indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hippoideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that the camelids are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of the HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of transmission interspecies of the HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there is an alfaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not the alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, bats-related alphaCoVs of HCV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpacus alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpacus alfaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that the alpacas obtain from humans alphaCoV related to HCV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising the fact that bats transmit HCV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of the MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back to decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is a cause of a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of the MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through the slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amps, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the CoVs to cross the barriers of the species.
First, their relatively high rate of mutation in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered as "moderated" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with revision mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even unfeasible.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of CoV by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of mutation of CoVs are almost one million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of the RNA in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in the modification of the genome to mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions in relation to the last three inches of the tip of the genome.
Thirdly, the CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during replication of RNA through a unique "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, tape exchange occurs frequently during transcription of the CoV RNA.
Long RNAs highly homologous and subgenomic can recombinate to generate new CoVs.
The phylogenetic evidences of natural recombination were found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animal CoVs, as well as the SL-CoV of bats and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the DLR of the S protein.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the DLR is in the amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ECA2, as well as its receptors to the viral input.
The DLR of SARS-CoV is able to recognize the receptors of the ECA2 of several animals, including bats, civets, mice and dogs-guaxinins, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and civets in the DLR, and four of them were located in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the protein spike interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the binding affinity of your S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times that bond greater than that between human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other proofreader may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Intriguing is the fact that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E and the 9-O-acetylated saulic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural HCoV reservoir hosts such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host's restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of the host-virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tender screening with a genome-wide reach of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCoVs: back to stock zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the ancillary proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide-exclusion characteristic 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs strains and rangeCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of the nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCVs, in which HCoVs are recombined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as host immune system pressure.
One example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While the intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCV-229E, the alpaca alphaCoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the pictures.
Finally, but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
The bats are likely to be well adapted to anatomically and physiologically CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminating cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules from the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (ERO) species generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt the host.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause as much mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
In this document we find explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from the replication of the CoV.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon's response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in bats is poor.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammable with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was found that bat CoV shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets house viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to world attention due to the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in the transmission between humans.
Broadly distributed evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoV strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that people stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to discover under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, a pangolim or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their parenting viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolution route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide for the diagnosis and treatment of infection of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and constitutes a good reference to combat this worldwide pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; due to this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment about our guide and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seven version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since the publication.
However, note that VOCID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge increase gradually based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; due to this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple scoring proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this world pandemic.
We endorse their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seven trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history elements with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and near areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases group (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces such as house, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging resources of the VOCID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte count at the initial stage of onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspected cases with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM and IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or some change in the specific IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 negative for positive or increased titre greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We may note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth edition (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal detection kit of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis and samples of the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us of paying attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they check and obey the most recent guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also timely update our guide to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease and Research Control of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anticorruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Bengali minister of road transport and bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This paralysing of public transport began on March 26th and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still permitted.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the world has passed one million, indicated data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This mark came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that, until Thursday, it was one of the few remaining coronavirus-free countries.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours prior to 10 hours in Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Throughout the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency in 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended to the whole day the duration of the touch of collecting in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 15h to 6h.
Thailand plans to implement pick-up from 10:00 to 4:00 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Shops in Australia Reduce Hygienic Paper Limits by Transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australian Woolworths and Coles store networks reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and one package per transaction in all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stocking in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper with home delivery for one package per request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in her March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many shops are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand for "no precedents", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
The sales had a "increase" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI predisposed stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said that retailers try to increase stocks, but that restrictions of the local joint regarding the frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after early release of the stock, some shops will not be able to carry out the Wednesday promotion.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores restock every night.
He pointed out that the toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that when exhausted, it leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the [de] opinion that if there were a lot in the shelves, if products such as toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [buried] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives Crap said on the last Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who produces the Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to news.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate vendors were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being made with buyers entering on strike at the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin newspaper, included an eight-page insert in order to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, soaps for hands and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" only indicates the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to drive governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres, it is an "unparalleled" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "out of influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored since emergence until continuous global dissemination".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a crownvirus."
And he continued "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, "in short, will get worse."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus’ 2019–20 pandemic is a continuous pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
It is estimated that the mortality rate is 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
No specific vaccine or antiviral treatment is known.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth while coughing, keeping distance from people and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, pickups, workplace risk controls and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socioeconomic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and generalized shortage of supplies exacerbated by purchases triggered by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Wuhan Health Authorities in China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of pneumonia cases for unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated at the beginning of January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the wholesale market for Huanan Sea fruits and, therefore, it is believed that the virus is zoonotic.
The causing virus of the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close connection with morcego, pangolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms that are known to have diseased on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections with the posterior group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds were connected to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as the new cases reported were decreasing in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among 19-year-olds, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s leading scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that, in China, until January 23, it was estimated that 86% of infections due to VOCID-19 had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5,7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms until death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official number of deaths due to the VOCID-19 pandemic usually refers to those who died and who had a positive test for VOCID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much larger, since it may not include people who died without testing, for example, who died at home, in resting homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of deaths per VOCID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by underreporting episodes in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths in all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial onset and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of the infection by resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the fatality rate of infection for the pandemic in general is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is compatible with the results of the first COVID-19 random test in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the site.
Maciej Boni, from Pennsylvania State University, stated that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when it will occur."
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan defended that "it can end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London declared that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue to be in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study of Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I suspect that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on the immunity of the group and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarrh), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are the difficulty to breathe, pain or persistent chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of the tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a confirmed person be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is mainly disseminated by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, the close contact being considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets may also be produced during expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
Droplets can be placed in the mouths and noses of close people or possibly inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
The propagation can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) establishes that, although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronaviruses related to their nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B). Two strains of this same strain are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, throughout the genome level, to other crownvirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and humans.
Comparison of the entire genome, up to now, has found a maximum of 92% genetic material sharing between pangolim coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography (CT).
A study in Wuhan comparing RRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT is not used for screening or as a frontline test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours to a day.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal rubbing, although throat rubbing is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been sufficiently precise to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The peculiarities of radiographic images and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include opacities in asymmetrical peripheral dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is bringing together an online international database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of VOCID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to those of the PCR and demonstrated that although the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as an investigation tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of characteristics of images of the virus with radiographs and CT.
Strategies to avoid the transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper cloth and putting this scarf directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travels going to or coming from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community propagation in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that health professionals take care of individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by localization data governments from mobiles for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinse the nose and gnashing with colluries, which has proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
That's because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (in up to one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or a daycare centre, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the elbow folded or with a paper cloth when coughing or sneezing, as well as discarding any scarf immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since wearing a mask may limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without adequate hand hygiene." The use of masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of a non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when entering into close contact with someone else (make 1 meter or less distance).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical masks is recommended when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's sanitary authorities are encouraging people to make face masks of cloth at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to leave in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam called for everyone to wear facial masks on their way out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on trains and intermunicipal buses wear masks to the face from 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use a face mask when going out on the street. At the same time, it was recommended the production of masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Masks for the face have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions designed to slow the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone by staying at home, limiting their travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings and keeping away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of the transmission of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social detachment" with "physical detachment" to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social detachment" led to the implications that social isolation was needed in full instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include only having sex with someone you live with, who does not have virus or virus symptoms.
Home self-insulation was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for adequate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-sustaining for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions of autoquarentena were issued to those in high-risk groups.
It was recommended to individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with large scale transmission that make 14 days of self-care since the last possible exposure.
Strategies for the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is performed in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When containing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression demands more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic to a basic rate of reproduction less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-care; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events leading to agglomeration; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, were in quarantine and travel bans were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to make the spread of the virus limited.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines. Moreover, the government issued alerts on the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when performing self-care and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those that stifle medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the reduction of the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the epidemic growth) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overloading health systems at the same time.
The suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs before. Otherwise, transmission occurs again as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, which include testing existing medicines.
The use of cold medications that do not need medical prescription, drink plenty of fluid and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19 virus.
The WHO describes the increase in capacity and the adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to move their resources, at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, as well as the increase of intensive care capacities through staff training and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region increased gradually.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market for Huanan Sea fruits. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The following day, the doctor informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were repudiated by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on 31 December, made a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled to approximately seven days and a half.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by Chinese New Year’s migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation center, as well as a main point of railway connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Subsequent official data show that 6.174 people had already developed symptoms until January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Depending on the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
Country reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home containment orders or lockdowns) and pick-up touches. On April 2, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case of November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia from unknown causes on December 26th. Her hospital reported the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27th.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from the patients indicated the presence of a coronary virus of the SARS type.
A communiqué to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police for "spare rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", a health cordon was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips from or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year, on January 25, were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Together with the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention and stadium centres. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the expansion of the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) went through some kind of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took rigid measures to avoid the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China only had one domestic transmission case in five days, in which case, through a traveler returning to Guangzhou coming from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese prize winner, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of cases of domestic transmission had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details on when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a three-minute moment of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10, coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their tributes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency of the country reported a significant increase in the cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu coming from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13%, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were placed in quarantine after testing to confirm that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The timeline of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and most well organized program in the world in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and traced and quarantined those who came into contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, virus test by drive-thru, with results available the following day, in addition to increasing testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
The South Korea program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it did not place whole cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the claim of government malmanagement of the outbreak, or by exalting its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases lower in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closing of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Riais to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between the cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between the cities before the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the virus spread after China during February.
Amid allegations of covering up the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries traced their cases related to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, the Human Rights Watch vehemently requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths on a single day, the largest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 politicians in exercise or retired and government officials died as a result of the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to one WHO representative, there should be five times as many cases in Iran as it is being reported.
It is suggested that the US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be alleviated for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of the outbreak, the entrances and exits of people are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the football matches of Series A, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events have been fully suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding the screening protocols that could be used.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus until that time may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus came first as one of the mildest in the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a consequence, the government received criticism for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and academies should be closed as soon as possible, and undertook to pay 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of £2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing crowds with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through fines and dispersal of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for businesses considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and car workshop.

WHO praised the Chinese authorities' efforts to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid the panic near the festivities in the new moon year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a recommendation from the WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated".On 30 January, after confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as the Emergency of Public Health of the Field International (PHEC), the sixth PHEC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked due to the "risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that interfere unnecessarily in international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance a strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "have no systems in place to detect the people who have contracted the virus, and even if it arises".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "to invest now or they will have to pay later."On February 11, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire United Nations system as an answer."
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated, as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO declares will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and developmental implications resulting from the outbreak".
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was enabled to provide international and WHO experts on land in China with assistance in household management and to assess "the severity and communicableity of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas."On 25 February, the WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible Coronavirus pandemic", declaring that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should nevertheless establish "a phase of preparation".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment of Coronavirus would be high from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergencies program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for each government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that the correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan further stated that current data did not allow public health officers to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction."The WHO faced many criticisms and was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733 thousand people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the United Kingdom Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, who began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed because of their approach to quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories on COVID-19 originating in the USA or Italy.
The United States administration of Donald Trump referred to coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan's Virus" saying China's censorship "has overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which in turn has been condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to divert the failure in administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has managed from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication stratagem with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as "That all has to do with China.
It was advised that we should try and get these messages anyway, including press conferences and TV appearances. "Canals such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased and 'generosity policies'.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively divulging the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending help to those same countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by United States sanctions on April 3.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other nations into their own country.
And hear disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Mr Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China has responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitics and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio dispensed the reports of the media and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
The spokesman for Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov said that "to offer help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the US troops and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political figures in exercise or ex-political.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the world’s leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipate that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-elected as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts, after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be put in a two-week quarantine at government designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment in relation to those they called inadequate emergency management, or praising their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted in such a way that the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, could rule by decree indefinitely, suspend the parliament as well as the elections and punish those considered having spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, resulting from the increase in the use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, purchases motivated by panic, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration issued warnings about drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumption and vendor interruptions.
Several locals also experienced the event of purchases motivated by panic which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daled, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that was foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not notice a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released reserves of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reservations for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was much hit in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the outbreak of SARS from 2002-2004.
An estimate by a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the supply chain of the world that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global equity markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock exchange indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the average Dow Jones industry showed its most expressive falls since 2008, with the fall of Dow at 1.191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All the other three indexes ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH stated China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions again fell on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the largest fall on March 16.
Many consider it a probable economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of central states and banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they have reacted to financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist spots, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional Flybe airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a great travel season associated with the Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's festivals, with private companies closing their shops and tourist attractions as well as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Moon Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
On 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of GDP in the country and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was globally affected, with reductions in shop schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
The North American and Middle East resellers observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a decrease of 33-43% in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
The Shopping Centers operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers have been abandoned at home in indoor provinces or imprisoned in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government help.
The outbreak of Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily pay) unemployed. An Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some type of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany put their workers under government-funded reduced-time work programmes known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time work remuneration programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
Performatic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, museums, bookshops, performance sites and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-acceleration impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the Christian Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home rather than attend Masses on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer a drive-in style.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as their residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Cassinos and other gaming sites around the world were closed and face poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new registration fees. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling their tournaments.
Many great theaters like Broadway also cancelled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live shows or creating "festivals" online for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet about coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of VOCID-19, an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism has been observed for people of Chinese or Eastern Asian descent, and against people from areas of focus in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidences of fear, distrust, and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Results of February (when most of the cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or being receiving a just punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the advance of the outbreak in new countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. The citizens of countries that include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring the ban on the entry of Chinese into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Manifestants in Ukraine attacked buses that transported Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, bordering China, and students in the big cities of India allegedly suffered persecution related to the crownvirus outbreak.
The president of unity in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "mistaken." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and targets of "discart".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all of the coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the coronavirus respiratory disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus associated include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
The antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and the level of livestock immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests performed in countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTR-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx rubbing or saliva sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal rubbing is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear into the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by suction catheter or expedited material by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as a basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-CoV-2-based SARS-CoV detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It seeks the "E" gene shared by all coronavirus beta, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency approval of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel to Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time to public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests as a function of fault reagents, and one obstacle to testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only from then on were the local and state laboratories allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories began the tests in early March 2020.
From March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the RT-PCR based VOCID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 available nationally from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing should be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for VOCID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic stated that it had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (U.S.A.) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA USA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses the amplification technology of isothermic nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in a particular way to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15-20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax radiographs have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before the onset of symptoms".
Typical TC characteristics include bilateral opacities in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve according to the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the origin point of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and population monitoring. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PCT).
Automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspect patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sampling tube to the patient," they must expel saliva in the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspicious cases, a health professional collects samples taking the appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the hospitals Technion and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, collecting the samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese:
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine would have doubled if this test capacity did not have an online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models published by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulation for liquids.
In March the shortage or insufficient quantities of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the USA.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for additional tests. On March 31, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates are now doing more per capita tests in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on the way to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of the drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass processing laboratory of Group 42 and BGI population scale (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to drive tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to run outside of China.
Different test methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method for the manufacture of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the means to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until 28 January; there was delay in the tests available to the US and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak; moreover, these countries with Australia failed to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and test recommendations made by health professionals.
On the other hand, the experts state that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, was consolidated over many years by the government of South Korea.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to delay the advancement of the VOCID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the USA, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported precise problems in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be a consequence of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister said that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that the Turkey test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that it would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for the SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers who work in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With the aggressive monitoring of contact, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as mandatory closing of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to seriously advise the inhabitants to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened within the planned after the vacation on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
One statistical study identified that the countries that performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is influenced by the country testing policy.
A country that tests only persons admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Handwashing with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by a oro-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning up the child’s bumblebee or exchanging diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling raw meat, frank or fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be hygienized with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, food or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteriums, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who manage food or work in the medical area, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in deliveries made at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simple introduction of behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, which is comparable to providing clean water for poor areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as an automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The pneumonia, the main AKI, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in a entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in one quarter.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions due to skin resecting.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of peeling and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent handwashing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (impression, defecation), after cleaning up a child's bumblebee (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations where the right handwashing technique should be used to prevent the transmission of diseases include the before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or wheezing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of washing of the hands with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index with 97 percent; the United States close to the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest index with 23 percent. Several methods for behavioral changes currently exist to increase acceptance about the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods. Collective handwashing for children in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to instill handwashing in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The deparasitation twice a year, complemented by the washing of the hands daily with soap, the brushing of the teeth daily with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
The water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The barbed soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated barbed soap concluded that the transmission is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic commands for dosage is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public conscious in terms of health.
To date, there are no indications that using recommended antiseptic or disinfectant may lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although antibiotic resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic agent is a non-aqueous base hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic basic hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antiseptic hand hygiene products, or hand hygiene agents) begin to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or moisturizer, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the effect of alcohol resecting.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygienizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs with efficiency.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logarithm reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (4-5 logarithm reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be well washed, being rubbed with the two palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand hygienizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause skin resecting, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The alcohol resecting effect may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and resecting in the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives in alcohol-based hand hygienizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritative contact dermatitis became an attractive compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand hygienizers are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, other than alcohol, which revealed their reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended running water as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes the skin germs, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the skin germs, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Swallow well with running water.
Washing on a sink can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under nails.
Artificial nails and lacquered enamels can house microorganisms.
Hydrating lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example pouring water from a gallon or cooking with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "unprotected towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a wire suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to clear a small amount of water in the hands and a soap bar.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion on the most effective way to drying in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel paper is much more hygienic than the hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by the towel paper, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area close to the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area close to the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area close to the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross contamination among other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which designs air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hand and drive potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment in up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Towel roles did not show significant dissemination of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared with drying with towel paper.
Handwashing with wet-clothed hand hygiene is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygienators must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team of washing hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the finger joint.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the faucet (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of hands by these surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains in unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate hand washing and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of catheter-related infections in the bloodstream by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a newsletter demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Times" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care, adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal soaps or "antimicrobials") confers an exterminating action on a handwashing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before surgery or in situations in which antibiotic resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, water in the forearms should not flow into the hands.
After handwashing is finished, hands are rinsed with a sterilized towel and the surgical bat is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic to your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the frequency of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the alcohol-based hand hygienizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygienizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium spores difficult in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the team's awareness of hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand hygienizers and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more efficient in different health institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essential tool that is economically viable in order to have good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water sources, soap or resources for hand washing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of universal hand washing practice.
For example, in most rural Africa taps for hand washing close to any public or private bathroom are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of entrenched habits and not the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and defense of washing hands with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a change in the long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the three maximum stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the promotional campaigns for handwashing carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The world day for handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF released the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to encourage more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the HIVIC-19 pandemic in 2020 led to an increase in awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "hand-washing techniques" were hung close to hand-washing sinks in public bathrooms and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be aware of something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning" such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, the tevilah and the Yadayim netilat in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity, and the ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow hand washing after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow hand washing before and after meals.
Hazard controls at the workplace for VOCID-19
Hazard Controls at Work for VOCID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of VOCID-19.
According to the Department of Labour Health and Safety (OSHA), functions at lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and with other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encourage employees to stay at home if they are ill, maintain a respiratory label and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Functions with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of contamination with COVID-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or because they have traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, working environments of high population density, and in the retail market of large volumes.
The hazard controls for this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective coverage and the provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health system and of necrotories that are exposed to people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of generating aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The epidemic of COVID-19 can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are ill, because they have to take care of other people or because of the fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are in demand and of the means of purchasing these products (such as making purchases outside peak time or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without the worker's behavior, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or work procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help to prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as necessary (e.g. respirators) used appropriately and continuously, regularly inspected, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Labour Health and Safety (OSHA), low exposure work has minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick and using the respiratory label, including covering the sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for lentils and for common garbage, preparing for telework or turning shifts, if necessary disincentive to the use of tools and equipment from other workers, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick member of the family, and that they are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, works with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct 6-foot contact (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission in the company's location, or because the individual has a recent history of travelling abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail stores. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic toilet fixtures and the installation of a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include the incentive for workers to stay at home, the replacement of face-to-face meetings by virtual communication, the establishment of staggered shifts, the cancellation of non-essential travel sites with current epidemic of COVID-19, the development of communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' doubts, the provision of training and updated instruction on risk factors and protection practices against COVID-19, the training of workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment, with equipment for use, individual supply of resources and a working environment that promotes the environment, the protection of the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the

Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on an aeroplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the sick person from other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a facial mask, or to ask the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with sheets when coughing or sneezing.
The crew shall use disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient presents fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biological waste bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include deferral of travel by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is for medical follow-up in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or choral education classes, or meals in a lanchonet, increasing the space between tables, times of arrival and departure more rigid, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate place of health care for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school dispensations can be considered. For law enforcement authorities that perform daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals suspected of COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and necroterics to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Functions with high risk of exposure include workers in the delivery of medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transportation, who are exposed to confirmed or suspected VOCID-19 patients.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected VOCID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, or invasive collection of specimens.
High-exposure necrotory work includes workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure makes it very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be adequate in some scenarios of necrosis and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution of biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspicious case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particle filtration, approved by NIOSH or higher quality respirators, should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of macabres, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without procedures for generating aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, eye protection or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends the minimization of the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter into a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary PPE for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE and discourages the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

ANSWER: [Covid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
Date/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to the other.
Their challenges have no precedent, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community creation, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, connections and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as coworkers.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
That person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, because you keep your work sites active, pay our coworkers, and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next days and months.
At that meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to maintain sustainable organisation in that period.
We want to end stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to get away for a while, you have no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours per week, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work at the normal time, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy food or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule would not have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No certified or paid strike is required. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives the appropriate attention from the management).
The staff who work per hour will receive the full payment.
We've said that before, and we're committing ourselves to honouring our commitment to our hourly contractors and employees.
All will receive their wages on the basis of their normal working files under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give full support to you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to tell your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we should continue to carry out.
The Site Trust Engineering, HR, Trust and Security and Fund Engagement teams (including others) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Unfastening now will not harm us in the future.
We do not intend to "work double to recover lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide longer budget time, and that employees prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our work colleagues from San Francisco may have been exposed to the VOCID-19 virus.
In view of this, as a precaution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the inlet gauge and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its visitors.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in Washington is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for the COVID-19 with us and with all Washington employees.
Last week, our office in Washington moved to a totally remote configuration, in line with the shared guide with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to occur, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of the meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and send in advance reading materials.
Use videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and real-time connection.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remote channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR team of operations is researching ergonomic guides in the context of the webinar to help in the increase of remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community assistance to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as publishing marathons, until the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warn them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could prevent the completion of their agreed subsidy activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep the focus in their own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up to date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting to each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The team of communication resources will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, do not stop notifying it and working with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an email to Bryan Jutan, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that, at this time, our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt in the past.
These are the steps we believe to be necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months after.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, a communications resource team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
The ACE2 neutralizes the activity of angiotensin-related converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and elevating Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also works as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a metalloenzyme containing zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a peptide M2 N-terminal domain and a C-terminal amino acid and collectrin transporter domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage type 1 membrane protein with its enzyme active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and in other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleavage from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is coupled to the cell membrane of the main type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The mRNA expression of ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
The ACE cleps the type I angiotensin hormone in type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
The ACE2 in turn cleps phenylalanine of carboxiterminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also clenches several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 acts as the main point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the protein spike S1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the serin-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells may help in the fight against infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporary evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to renin-angiotensin-class system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II in circulation is high. rhACE2 infused was evaluated in clinical tests for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, that is, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with a COVID-19 person.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be transferred to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a security engineering professor at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to your App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement asking for limits for this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected and presented as evidence-based protection;
digital surveillance should avoid aggravating discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism of your operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to execute contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including tracking data on mobile devices and card transaction data, combining them to generate text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made the location information publicly available, which is allowed due to the comprehensive changes to the information confidentiality laws after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy system and the centralized one.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to, at least, 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracting (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leave the device, and any combination is done on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or route crossing to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research from the technical publication "Applicants play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the MPC Enigma, a burden that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and those responsible, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same approach and largely with overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the conquest of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, became open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed that they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They have also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees three stages of implementation:
development of tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications while preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly on iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Repositioning of drug (also known as drug reproposal, reperfilation, reassignment or therapeutic substitution) is the reproposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-free proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable development project of effective antiviral drug against VOCID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that then improved and analyzed for their structural similarities with the more similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorised by the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when there's no other option.
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the evidence available to support the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan to stock it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in severe cases of the disease when the virus has multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
Drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and infections by Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against wire, pneumus, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which can cause transmissions or more serious diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and the other for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other does not have control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical test of the Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, which is an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited among the serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the efficacy of treatment.
At the moment, researchers from the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, with low molecular weight, is widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study with 300 patients is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on 14 April in Italy.
Due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in order to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#CovID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical tests, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 platforms of diverse technologies being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the major platforms that have advanced to phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the initial stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs the safety test and preliminary immunogenicity. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, at the same time as determining the most accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in avoiding the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 active-developed vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (followed by preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, Queensland University announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular cluster, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the Centre for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announces the beginning of work on a vaccine, with the aim of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.

Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated step, it would take at least a year to half and two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is under investigation in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian declared that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to Covid-19's vaccine" under protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a mRNA-based candidate vaccine, currently under preclinical testing, with clinical tests expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from preclinical tests in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could leave for human testing in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparation for Epidemics (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, leading CEPI's total investment in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists began testing six different vaccine candidates for animals.
The researchers from Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an automagnifier RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving Chinese sequencing.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Nearly the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for VOCID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other Coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "The MNA delivered vaccines of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that aroused potent responses of specific antibodies to antigens [in the rat] that were evident that they started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce virus-like harmless particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities gathered resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, in combination with the cloud computing of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease that it prevents.
A randomized later test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial researches to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using samples of animals specific to the COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for containment measures for level 3 biosecurity to manipulate live viruses, and an international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animal specimens.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing research of SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against the infection of MERS-CoV.
From March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three other in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The exposure time until the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153 thousand deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already healed. The virus is disseminated among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by cough, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or stay on surfaces rather than remain infectious in long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription polymerase (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for those responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the population in general vary, where some authorities recommend the non-use, some recommend the use and others require the use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six regions of the WHO.
Viruses may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty keeping awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may evolve to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for the COVID-19 is normally six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function that these asymptomatic perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not present symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speak aloud frees more droplets than talk normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science suggested that the transmission by bioairsol can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of people contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, if you believe the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually one or two people infect one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if they are used properly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the onset of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its layer of protection. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "sparticle" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with infections with ICUVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropses of people who died due to VOCID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, it was demonstrated that pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of IL-6 secretory inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in necropsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarro sample can be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
From 4 April 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) were developing, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing showed that their accuracy is 60-70%.
The FDA of the United States approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. Diagnosis guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar dark glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (lobular sects thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRD) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a cloth when coughing or sneezing, as well as cover the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the cloth is not available.
Appropriate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit the transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include people staying at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
It is not known an effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curving the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based antiseptic for hands with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For places where antiseptic for commercial hands are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are using the virus use a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive doctors and pneumologists from the U.S.A. gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be exercised to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation, are being performed.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in isolation rooms for infections transmitted by air (SIIA) as well as taking standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (IPS) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, respirator or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (U.S.A.).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their efficacy against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive pressure in the airways at two levels.
If one of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to keep invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the airborne particles to spread, compared to the high flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in elderly people (those over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developing countries do not have adequate per capita hospital beds, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of severe COVID-19 cases enough to require hospitalization.
One study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ADRD) develops in the VIVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more and more difficult.
Ventilators that have pressure control mode and high level of PEEP are required to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical tests are being carried out with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorisation for plasma use of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the life of the person is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are requested to report their ID name and number.
The application can detect the "close contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people with whom they had contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data for people who are allegedly with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial-recognition technology to detect those who neglect quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government led a 48-hour hack at the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, seeming other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection of COVID-19, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data from COVID-19 are missing. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of those hospitalized in hospitals with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of the initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic alterations were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image examination looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage was detected due to elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Underreporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about sequelae of the disease in the long term.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong found a decrease of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported in which the recovery of VOCID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin by means of transshipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but from December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the emergency CID-10 CID codes U07.1 for deaths from confirmed laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without confirmed laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate by case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals dying from a disease, and the mortality rate by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals dying from a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and accompany a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may give information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was propagated by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 must have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were killed by confirmed COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50-year age range, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to gender, lower prevalence of smoking women and development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the US government was not tracking data on sex-related infections by COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations of nomenclature to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCov" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal zaragotes and parts of breathers.
In an example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the required schedule, a local startup made reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from day to day.
After the initial outbreak of VOCID-19, conspiracy theories, wrong information and misinformation emerged about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV are being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, either inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the skin protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a copyless genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 ongoing clinical trials since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up most of the Chinese research, with nine clinical tests in phase III of remodeling in several countries due to a report of the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug candidates and vaccine for VOCID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of VOCID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remodeling since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate remdesivir.
Phase III clinical tests are being performed in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after having demonstrated a low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial skin protein in preparation for serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-temperature properties of cytokine. Tocilzumabe was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized test at stage 2 of the national level in Italy is under way, after having demonstrated positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of the death of some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of refractory cytokine release syndrome with steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinational method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mechanism of action expected by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are developing.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disease, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
