UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts nearly five years and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with the foreign ministers of five permanent countries present at the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - at the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional authorities "did this situation unsolved".
Ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some tried to label him as a flip-flop politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to tear Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the appointment chances of real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for nominating Republicans.
Pundits shows that, during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance took place to Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why he'd be struggling hard at the general election are numerous.
But the outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the conservative Economic Club for Growth group admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Below are a few figures from the recent polls suggesting that real estate mogul is not just passing:
The figures indicating support for Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion on real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These figures shall be maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favourable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “thank you” if Trump would win the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 says they'd be "suppressed" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% says it would be “enthusiasmates” compared to 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be “unthankful” or “suppress” if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level consider that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the survey conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where still 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% do not believe that he has the personality necessary to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, at the question who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most of the GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans or folded to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will split to more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this respect and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say that they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violators" in his opening speech, two months ago, immigration was the central topic of the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration towards authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in governance.
People are also upset by the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the benefit of the Republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unsatisfied" and 21% "navous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at the PMQs has been long awaited.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
In weekly appearances, he asked for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he could drop out of a few participations and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called a "famous cabinet" and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent on the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative MPs and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that he "kept silent respectfully" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, said for the BBC's Two's Newsnight show that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferent" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's lead team, arguing through differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, states that the policy differences are "combined" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn is appointed to his position on the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in its exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has the ideas of "outside sources" for questions addressed to Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and that they will refrain from replicas and attacks, engaging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he can't participate - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor occasionally, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs, but admitted a few years later that he failed to do so.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer for the reasoning of a leader, the way he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a caricature and that he needs a profound reform.
"Cadru in Joburg": Homeless young people benefit from photo courses
It's hard being a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money out of it.
BBC News met with one of the project's first graduates.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could damage expansion
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, said that an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "a higher purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power would exceed the higher labour costs in the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unpleasantly into the spotlight by the scandalous gap Kyrgios had over Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a short-term qualifying match, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen doing a rocket dust after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
“One thing I feel strong is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's be serious, he has mastered himself extremely well in quite provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an amazing team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, hardworking and integrated into the team, had no conflict with the other players, is highly respected in the dressing room, is training hard, is in excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important match, which starts Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long-term team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match and not think at all of the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good work for both the team and for him.
2016 elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage to Bernie Sanders has shrunk to half in national polls
The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, continues to have a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for candidacy at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't announced yet if he's running for the presidency, is backed by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than those of other candidates.
Faced with the survey conducted by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderators, but the advantage has been reduced.
Men's support has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still ahead of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has an easy 5-point advantage in this group.
Approximately half of the national Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if he were elected to run for the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percentages wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the probability that Clinton's current supporters are excited about his choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of the Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third I think he should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half claim that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if it doesn't run.
55% of the democratic voters considered Clinton to be the most likely candidate to win the general election; but the figures fell from 78% in the past month.
Biden is far from second place but the percentage according to which he is most eligible has increased.
However, when they are asked what is most important in a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of some key features vis-à-vis their party's primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and reliable and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three with respect to integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and trust, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three Clinton, Sanders and Biden have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these issues, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As the questions remain regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are pleased with his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied now with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that that email dispute did not affect their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they changed their opinion negatively.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they've changed Clinton's opinion in the negative.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and trust, this continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider him to be integrity and trust, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not believe it to be integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of voters at national level do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are ranked first in integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders intact is greater than those who do not feel the same, but, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Fraternity Members Charged for Killing the Student in Year 1 at Baruch College
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a ritual of initiation in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at the Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during a ritual of initiation in September 2013 and postponed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was tied to the eyes, put a 14 kg bag full of sand behind her and was repeatedly brusted while trying to move towards a target, on a frozen land.
Mr. Deng accused the headache after he lost consciousness.
The members of Pi Delta Psi did not call the emergency number after he passed out and pretending that he would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, says the police.
But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal property and practically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next day in the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, trunks and thighs.
“Many families have been devastated by fraternity rituals since at least one student lost her life every year because of the rituals,” said Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, in a statement.
The friars and their members must be held accountable and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Great Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with the murder of third degree.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with outrage and complicity in the murder.
"We want to take responsibility not only for those involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brother, official or informal, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch's faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with local representation.
Here's what's gonna happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate.
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (increasing market) will stifle, the profitability of bonds will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In the economy, history gives few clues about time frame..
After the first increase would interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on the moment when the interest rate begins to increase but on the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, in the game are multiple variables.
At the end of the day, however, players on the market may find that all the turmoil related to the increase in interest rate has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of "the cheap money," Julian Jessop, Chief Economist in Capital Economics, said in a note to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more normal level, but still small is the seismic shock they all seem to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here is how it could react to a few sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
Given the situation with which the market has been faced in recent months, the anticipation of interest rate growth can be volatile for a while.
But at the time of the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the currency policy gap again," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
In particular, in the last 35 years, the market has grown sharply - with about 14 percentages - towards the increase in interest rates, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (average increase of 2.6%) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the Chief Strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but raising the interest rate often contributes to it.
In this situation, the Fed is faced with some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have prepared all year round for a Fed growth decision, all of which are aimed at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in interest rate at the time of this meeting, future transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all the interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super-profit cycle, with GDP overshadowing the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period considered.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is more rapid in the case of bonds than in the case of shares when the Fed changes the policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits change direction as soon as the first growth/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, bond profitability is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that these increases in interest rate will result in the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, with the curve flattening.
High-cost obligations work better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about the strength of profitability," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Fed policy.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the expected decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the average interest rate of the credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens the policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that work mostly in the U.S. will have to win as a result of the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
The multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase of the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable in the next three months than an initial increase in interest rate," Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Strong-balance sheet firms exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have to gain from raising the dollar.
Those who save could also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "prostising"
It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also eyed BBC Music Awards, saying they plagiarized the Brits Awards
Col. Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show is original.
BBC Radio 3 is "moving into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentarian, putting pressure on him to prove that he's doing something that commercial posts don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public radio station "prosthetic" and is more and more like the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "prosthetics" - although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took eyes at BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to my mind that just copy what's already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent with respect to live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anything about the classical music I'm hearing from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he must make more efforts to attract the audience to the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticized at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee because it would follow up on its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the gift show purchased by BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that broadcast because it is not original and it is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be performed "in a specific manner BBC."
He added that he wants that Corporation to "find the golden egg chicken in its own way" the next time he launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban in the future the taking of new seasons from The Voice or to spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Over the last month, there has been the slowest growth from 2000 to now.
Online sales went up three years ago, thanks to mobile phone usage to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could lead to reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned British shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total amount of money spent in August has shown the smallest growth from 2000 to now, with a growth of only 5% in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the growth level in the previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been the trend to rationalize over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, for Guardian.
He explained that online sales went up three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it is a little stagnant, you may notice a decrease (in growth).
The Black Friday Phenomenon, imported from America, is referred to as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases prior to the event that took place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers were stuck in front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of the websites several retailers.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers beat up on bargains, could lead to the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ in every 5 £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Bin Laden family has been sanctioned, Muslims bury the victims killed after the macaral collapse in Mecca.
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets of Muslims, the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially victored the giant in constructions Saudi Binladin Group for collapse.
Minister of Health said that 394 people were injured in total as a result of the macaral crash.
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane crashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Embarrassed in white, those who complained of their deaths joined on their way to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden building group for the disaster, which also got 394 wounded.
In the ceremony unfolded on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane crashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said the Binladin Group is partially guilty of collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not provide the details, but stated that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Previously during this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macaral to collapse in the court of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the breakdown of the crane and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and did not coordinate its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Moschee in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is undertaking major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred under strong wind conditions and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every Muslim physically fit.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased would receive one million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of loans to Swiss francs
On the bank market, two offers have already appeared to convert loans into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to increased rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting loans to francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to the cumulative data of FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of interest fixed to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk commissions and administration paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the monthly payment equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of lei cover of credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the pay is charged.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not reassessed, no additional guarantees are required and another proof of income.
In practice, a new financial and legal analysis of the credit will not be carried out and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refiner.
Both banks also offer a reduction to the monthly rate, given that customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the customer pays very little of the principal.
Bancpost offer with very small interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and lower costs are lower.
A possible risk for all the loans in variable interest lei, is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the following years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is also possible to appear other costs, which are disregarded in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks to the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase or not the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey carried out by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who thought last week that the decision would be taken, I believe now that the situation will remain for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a normalisation process for interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, bringing back trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who's lost their charm.
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she fought with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in the face of cancer.
Rumor is that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly cost a lot.
Players Luke Shaw from Manchester United are standing on the bar for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to the right in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will hold him on for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The incident occurred as a result of a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20 years old, broke down the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "There's a double leg fracture and it's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, encounters difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
The locker's got the oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red cardboard and the concession of a punishment blow.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when they say it's foul and red cardboard.
It was a very bad two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for your messages, I don't have words to express how weak I am, start the way to recovery, I'll come back stronger.”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in defeat of PSV
The England team fund has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never seek to accident an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] reached it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel awfully stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked the failure of England but still stands strong
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I saw England's team selected for the tournament, I do not consider a repetition of defeat with 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a win on the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 events but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though it is unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left England's team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth as a team.
He played the seven matches test against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - players are their own pickers.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he runs more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The main coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance wasn't up to his ability and didn't surprise me; first of all, he's a teamman.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and on the move.
The only discontent you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in maximum form - but that missed opportunity is the past.
On the team, Alex Hales, a drummer I'm writing down very well.
He's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
At least the same opportunity should be given to those before it, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the EAU team.
The idea was released that Moeen would open at the fight next to Cook, which would lead extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that it's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his Worcestershire district, but it was no.3 for them, so the difference isn't big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 matches as the first drop before he opened in 2001.
It immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a spinner back-up and, although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age - with an average of 31 in the fight and 35 in the ball - and they might think it's point, but there's not a bunch of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
You'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the coach team.
The nomination of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master's blow.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and uncrunchable ambition.
I always thought she was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and just like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes, the new voices in the locker, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for the one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although they don't all agree, coaches and selectors don't do the program.
And you have to remember, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easy.
Brexit camp could gain cause if the economy remains calm until 2017
What happens every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is getting more and more confused, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past few days that - sunk in crises similar to that of the EU - not all being provoked internally - some Member States are fuelled with the UK's agenda for concessions and amendments to the treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that even they did not want this if it would erode social protection.
We could even call her Dave and George's selfie.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in the foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an outward perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor is extremely cautious, but he has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation collapses, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, France’s President, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "the UK has obtained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how overwhelming Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical are the barons of the oligarchic press that look at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in 2:1.
Perhaps he vaguely remembers Boris Johnson, the Euro-Oportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was Correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid tax purses, foreigners who fraud telephone and pseudo non-domes who hold most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more bluirite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that, either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me back on Mondays at Westminster - I told him not to take his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent media cooperation strategy, not with me, but with certainty with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would call evolution indulgent.
It states that it would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative “anglicism” could agree with that.
That's what Hilary said: "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as the shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be unfair to his colleagues, without going too far and without losing his position in the office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said or what JC told his colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it has made me aware - message discipline remains important in the television era and especially in the turn of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support of the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism on EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a hesoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents that narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of its sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is unspeakable about the fact that JC will not campaign for renunciation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, statements by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them linked to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet’s medical journal attacked the “extraordinarily fragile basis” that PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ questioned their assertions and their reasoning “on solid soil or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claimed that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a model of decision analysis with multiple criteria (MCDA) that summarises their opinions on the negative effects associated with different nicotine products; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in a research work.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about whose executive director was said to have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT public health accreditation in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an e-cigarette producer but not the financing that there are reports that they would have received it from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but among them there are a few known "folks" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group’s research work ‘combiningly shows’ that there is “solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to the majority of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that the PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at the PHE, says he's in the past responded to the BMJ statements.
He said, “Email is significantly less harmful than smoking”
One of two people who have been smoking their whole life loses their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk to health of e-cigarettes is minor, but we need to continue to study long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information which it derives from and does not come from evidence, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative dangers to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related illness and the annual costs incurred by the national health care system due to smoking amount to 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear the current evidence - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they only show a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty.

Complaints that shame the arms trade of Great Britain
Follow Amnesty International's film against the arms fair.
Terrible killers!
Swellings to crush the ankles!
Dispersal bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp show, made by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and subways that need a second look.
"Is it important to travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line becoming the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of weapons dealers will be brought to bear on the DLR's clients are asked to contribute to the halt of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound Allen key package that says "facilitates access to about one-third of the advertising space on the planet's bus stations."
The London transport region is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of steering wheel.
One of the parish announcements produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside galleries.
Many artists aim to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against arms trading that greets the commuters circulating by the subway.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the ad for the arms fair - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement but "enriching it with powerful animations and colors, was more striking".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not traded illegally and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the arms fair comes from within ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic products of euphemistics.
In a press release, Saab issued an order from the US Army for "AT4CS RS with a shoulder-backed launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped focus that offers stunning effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old boy who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I don't remember the forcible smiles of those we annoyed - and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nervous fall to horror.
The chatter is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of study break, what you think about Corbyn and why "Surely you are indifferent to Marmite because, for the best of all, it's nothing but HAHAHA's drug extract, you find me in my room."
Deep breaths.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These encourage the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you would not talk to even if the floodlight came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleeping often abounds in parties with drinks, movie evenings and socialization meetings, but there are also places where people dress and try their underwear.

Introverts have special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a shelter, but in many bedrooms a culture of perding through the dorms is built, based on friendship, socialization and friends that last their whole lives.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge his batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to stay friends, but I want you to leave to get my energy back by interacting with you."
Try to sensitize when a colleague is exhausted from socialization - and try to send an SMS instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy sitting in the same room with me had a policy that said that if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to make a acquaintance and go and a plate with brownies, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the '50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something for you, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
Good things prepared in the house are a great way to make you friends.

If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you -- try still to address the issue more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
He's in jail now.
Don't make any noise that doesn't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're literally going on blinds.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give music slower because it was 3 o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give music louder.
When they finally stopped the music, at 5:00 in the morning, the girl was nice and let them sleep two hours before leaving to the music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/future wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you confused a paler with your future husband, you hooked up, broke up, and you should meet every day and maybe even see him take over all your common friends?
Of course, you can't stand up against your heart - but if a sexy palier's colleague is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
At the thrilling moment when you realize that someone has left his keys in the unclosed room, the line between farce and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.

Violonist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a soloist but also as an initiator of a less common project, entitled "church", as he says himself, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the foreground was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu being non-lipsite.
Both performances, held on the Athens scene, showed the audience another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and was the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor at the time.
The conductor is the musician most important to the musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they talk about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so business, the music industry, makes it marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but you have to watch, which is stupid again," David Grimal considers.
The violinist tells that this change in the way he does music came after his solo career's "musical disappointments".
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I've never found any sense of going on this road.
That's how I decided to create Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do I imagine you're marketing with a collective of musicians where there's no ego anymore?" the artist asked.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians in the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a stumbling block in the musical act: "In a curious way, the more complex I sang a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", Supports Grimal, adding as to the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the greatest orchestras in the world that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited and this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as Enescu Festival, there is place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he didn't need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works to his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanesque music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal militates for the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the music mass, as organized today, has a death shaft" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it's no use.
In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, there's no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat".
In order to enter the EU, we had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come into the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them they're real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should turn to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce its learning in school, we reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education we no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
Depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be somehow, if we want to form a musician, it's quite something else.
After your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", the French artist asked smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from the passing of this "soldier" status, the overcoming of what "they believe are their limits": "The musicians discover in a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert there are scaffoldings".
David Grimal talked about the project or music and his vision of music and artist in the "Ideas Festival", a discussion with the audience organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
David Grimal Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, when he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris prior to his meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his course of life.
David Grimal has an international solo violinist career, along the lines of regular concerts over the last 20 years on the world's leading classical music scenes and prestigious orchestras such as the Paris Orchestra, the French Philharmonic Orchestra, the Russian National Orchestra, the Lyon National Orchestra, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Lyon Opera Orchestra, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony Warsaw, under the leadership of conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schänwant, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Frujahbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, and Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.
He was the recipient of dedicated works by several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom that Les Dissonance has offered him to collaborate with allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
In addition to Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless in the Saint-Leu church, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been an Artist at the Dijon Opera.
He teaches violin courses at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many master's courses and was a member of the Paris Long-Thibaud International Competition jury in 2010.
He received the distinction of Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quijote", a violin designed for him by the French Lutheran Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at the George Enescu International Festival this year together with the Orchestra Les Dissonances, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also went up the stage on Monday, this time with violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Micile Voci Mari"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the "3D Snow Farm" superproduction
Do you have a spontaneous, super-talented child who likes movies?
Give him the chance to get a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Micile Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If in classical drawings the emphasis was placed on the actor's voice of the specific character animated, in the last period, the creation of the story is also taken into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very familiar actors.
Cinema City Romania however wants to discover new voices and that is why we start an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to sign their children up for our competition.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"Kids will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania said.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11th to September 30th, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection following which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen, who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio alongside professionals.
All the parents have to do is access the small platform.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child at the competition and prepare him for the voice test.
Later, you have to choose one of the four available films on the platform, download the texts that the child will read and then, the child will register by interpreting his or her own version of double.
Four films about friendship, fairy tales, magic and hope can choose contestants for supporting the challenge: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Poznaş" and "Albinuța Maya 3D".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and double a character in the "The Snow Queen - 3D Snow Farm" superproduction, which will be premiered in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, fall tax forecast for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing the profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its inland transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in the pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the sound of the Wednesday opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure of $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decrease is estimated despite the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for the land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it is still waiting to increase its gains compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and developing online trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
Employment plans during the holidays were announced one day after the competitor UPS said he intends to hire 90,000,95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of jobs he made last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit grew by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit by a decline in international priority transport in recent years, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted FedEx Ground Division results.
In the last quarter, ground revenues have increased by 29%, but operational revenues have virtually stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday closing decreased by 11% at year level and by 17% at the maximum record recorded on June 11.
On the occasion of the most awaited meetings in recent years, the responsible for the development of policies within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon meal to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the headquarters meeting room, there will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the factor X in a decision that is too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be dealt with by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in effect from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growing economy, recent global financial market turmoil could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. brokerage firm.
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them more arguments," she said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, which in itself provokes instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg's recently questioned economists have anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But financial markets expect Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the Fed increases the interest rate, unless policy makers attenuate the impact by promising that it would pass a long time to the next increase.
Tuesday, industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed grew the interest rate at the moment," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers would do so, "they should take deep action in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about the timing of the Fed action.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow tightening the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that it expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite the high objections of liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to reach the annual target of the central bank, the Fed decision makers claimed that a key reason was the temporary effect of the sudden decline in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial media has fallen by 16% below the record peak in May, as investors have feared that slowing the Chinese economy will bring down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, the Dow index now being about 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the time of increase of the interest rate.
"Without what happened on the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, it would be more firm at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he expects that they will wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and they almost haven't given the basis for further events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
In reality, however, the Fed has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The simple allusion of the president since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "enough" its monetary expansion triggered earthquakes on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly engulfed, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the investment company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to be unrelated to economic bases."
As a member of the Federal Open Market Commission, the decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rates, has, for example, offered the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia caused the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the implications of limited identification for U.S. development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to the respective decreases.
Fed should only put the issue of financial stability first in the case of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate commission.
The last hectic period does not go even further at that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to be in a position to fear an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset," Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think that it should take any early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to broadcast in Today's Show about the change of party leadership
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's urgent move to Canberra to communicate on the subject of the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning show of the Nine channel broadcast from the capital after the defeat of Tony Abbott in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The Sunrise competition, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Army, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Cascade and Cancun.
This distance “cruzime” did not seem to count too much for the Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having a hearing of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today showed a slight increase compared to the Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330.000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series having him as the protagonist on the former star from Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, subject to a recently widowed father who decided to move with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's hearing results answered loudly that "yes".
The show X Factor transmitted by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking the face of the shows The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night of the transmission of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half of an hour (17:30 till 18:00) went up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia's show had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second evening will give silent confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights

Since he opened President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into the crowd demonstrating against the new proposed constitution of the country, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in Rupandei district, about 280 km west of Kathmandu capital.
According to statements by Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief of district police, more than 1,000 protestors gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas after which they fired fires before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last week after violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also existed in the West of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution was initiated in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted the terms of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, cops and weapons
The Prime Minister shall continue the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Wednesday government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's strong position towards the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It is a shame for the 21st century Europe to apply methods of the 30s," Victor Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A large, low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands has a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of formation of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the meteorologist from Miami added.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
Benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still premature to tell if diabetes with mild obesity lives longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight unit relative to height, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9 range.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and persons with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and mansoon gastrectomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes has remained at nearly the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who have undergone surgery, diabetes has healed completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes mellitus healed completely at only 1% and partially at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol "bad" were generally better in the surgical group," the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored blood levels of A1c which reflect blood glucose levels over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean level of A1c haemoglobin decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved ‘glycaemic control’ - reflected in the improved levels of A1c haemoglobin - did not reduce mortality to five years, according to Chief Researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the mansoon gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), recorded a higher decrease in BMI (7.4 compared to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% compared to 2.1%) and had a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on large-weighted people in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, Blackstone says, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery had a probability of approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for individuals with BMI below 35 procedural stakeholders.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader has sent a call to end violence in refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Oxford Dalai Lama Center for Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must at the same time think about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying the US violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the September 11 events, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this issue without appealing to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgian Poisoning Center, U.S. anti-poisoning centers reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hand detergents with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgian Poison Center, cases of hand cleansing in children under 12 years of age reported in the Poison Centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids have more access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them get to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children are deliberately drinking detergent and others are doing it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube, films that introduce teenagers as they drink detergents to create cheap drinks can be watched.
It seems that teenagers have mixed the detergent with alcohol water to get a louder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavor, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand cleaner contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-tongue center at Kansas University Hospital, for Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four powders with strawberry-flavored hands detergent, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice as much as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated him at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah's beating and couldn't go when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use wet products or napkins without alcohol and stop leaving the hand detergent in the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergents containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York plotted to poison their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products into class" according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and prohibited him in his course room.
The police considered the plan to be "unmarked" and referred the disciplinary problem to the school inspector.
Rumour Mill: No misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths disassembles rumors about Celtic misunderstandings, Deila admitting that Hoops are not at the best moment but they will return.
Hearts in front of SFA on Neilson's and Warburton's accusations are cautious about the January purchases that affected the team's unit
Dons increases the difference from Celtic to five points
The criminalization of ADAM Rooney in the first round brought to Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of Hamilton's Pittodrie, Dons obtaining a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismounts rumors of misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstandings at Celtic, disassembled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they were preparing to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
Absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - by Boer
The former middle-aged Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for Rangers.
By Boer, currently Ambassador to Ajax, he said: “In Holland I am no longer transmitting a summary of Celtic matches; why?”
Because there's not Rangers in there.
Here, it's not just about the Rangers coming back.
It's about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's where interest is directed.
The tension is high in the games in the Old Firm and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic fights in awe, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now at the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had periods before and will recover."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we need to move on.
We really need the support of Celtics because that's how players get better.
It's extremely important that we stick together now.
Warburton's prudence on January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that he had identified a few objectives for the January transfers, the head of Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former head of Brentford said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer period.”
For players transferred the summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could see in this season in our group.
Team's doing great.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that aren't necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after retreat
The Striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that they could withdraw upon expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player fought two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts in front of SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts led by 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost by 3-2, but the red cardboard of the base was then cancelled - the third red cardboard cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was picked up after admitting that he played a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding, "I don't need to say I don't go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Board trusts Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still trust that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the team in Aberdeen must desperately hang on to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the first rebound shot executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said, "There's no team that won something in the cup or league, and won no games like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in Britain it increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in the period May, while the number of unemployed in the UK total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The 5.9% unemployment rate in Scotland was higher than in the United Kingdom, 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Bureau of Statistics (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed of 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the United Kingdom.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term authority plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate by increasing and the rate of unemployment falling.
Why I'm witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the Execution Hall of Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted it.
As the day draws near, I'm terrified of the idea.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can witness executions in America and, because requests usually exceed the number of available places, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to 5.
Those chosen will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, besides developing my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried at her.
He admitted that "it could have done better," but he still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and I wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
However, he wishes to see an international report on the subject.
He believes that, if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series that I've made.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die of this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards have tried to spy on him and threaten to retreat from the races
Peter Moody said that the Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
He launched an attack on the Stewars and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai in the race due to a treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody has told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do the best for racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Cobalt Test of Lidari, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not wish to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that it all suddenly slows down," Moody said.
It's known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to think it doesn't happen that way, I have to quit the coaching job.
At that moment I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview for racing.com where he said the integrity department tried to spy on her stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I'm going to tell him if I'm asking - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then you should all resign because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at that time and I know today.
Should I believe it's something personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start to have a spine and to be responsible for people outside the tractors for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on industry?
So bad is my influence on industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and put me away and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making right now could lead him to think about this option.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It saddens me very much.
I'll put pressure on and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The frustration of the trainer increased with the long-term investigation of cobalt testing into which Lidari was involved and the elimination led him to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, tagged the treatment rule from the day of the race as "ridical" after applying on the feet of the horses a cataplasm with mud or clay, which violates the rules.
Break the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put him on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the scene of the accident in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by a flight from the scene.
The bicycle was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be charged with running from the scene of the accident, the failure of the first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to his opponents in wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the plea tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought to the attention of the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the umpires allowed Storm players to "take a shot" the team in Storm's nervously won game in the qualifying finals played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when he called the match a "show" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's board tactics and said players were simply focusing on "contact" when they boarded.
Bellamy says she trusted after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
“And things don’t stop here – I haven’t heard Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us up with the 24-2 score,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we've really put our emphasis on contacting plates and so we've changed the situation.
Trent is in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not usual to lose and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "the soul of football", reminding him of Bennett's mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 championship, playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about thrilling football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember, in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he's not interested in it as black as he's under the fingernail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be thrilling football, especially because of the fast young middle people.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a tougher match than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, that means exciting game?
Or is it thrilling to pause and not mark?
It's plans for me.
If I'm talking about us, it means at some point we can meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home with either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the finals of next Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, the tickets being put on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images having children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the phone's disappearance, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages after which she immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed the computers found at that address and found “intriguing” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with children.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretend he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: "He said it's an addiction - that it's addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did search the computer but said he did it because he wanted to give himself as a cop to scare the pedophiles.
She was asked about the conversations she had with the unknown person who sent her images and that she asked that person to send her other pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he didn't think clearly when he was drinking and wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found her messages on the phone, she screamed her mother and shivered and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, 23-year-old Hogg, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to allegations that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the appearance of 24 March this year.
The defense lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be registered in the registry of sex offenders because it can be said that this crime "has not involved a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
He was in the sex offender's registry before the sentence was handed over.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall was not injured, it became viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by representatives of the opposition who claimed that they would have received anonymous threats to death, threatening that Mr Mugabe would not be husked during his speech.
Last month they hushed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but is called "death," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “concerned” about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 dispensations
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 dispensations as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide on the stock exchange into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from operations with fulminant growing corporate hardware and services.
The planned availability will cost about 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure," said Meg Whitman, the president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will hold a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business running style," Whitman said.
By acting as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and “focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the object of which is the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention best in a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men 20-45 years of age in the UK, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign Against Unhappy Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the struggle to succeed this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy state of disposition”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half the probability of occurring.
Of course, in order for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response is often given priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even deeper.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in their comfortable shoes, and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be able to associate with this situation, even though they often fail to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ..."my role in listening to people with a suicide tendency and depression showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people who appeal to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that come to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the phone, people reached in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full play of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasted by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - with the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to stand in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
Next we present you the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches from the Champions League groups, with a quiet 2-0 victory against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a series of occasions before securing the advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the minute 61.
Arriving in Groupa A alongside Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the French team's goal is not only to qualify for the best but also to improve the course towards the final quarter of each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of empty after which he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or on the move in the Champions League, so 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference to the next rankings, even if there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, though I'm sorry we couldn't give another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-3-remise from Bordeaux in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took over the spotlight in minute four.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midwife was called the man who will take the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he hurled to Marco Verratti's step behind Malmo's defense before he crashed incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected the PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders to national teams, with a defense of five people and two half-defensives, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's move past Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down the pace several times, giving a few unnecessary steps and not finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five trials only in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani just after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much better at supporting his colleagues, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a hijacked by Wiland over the gate in the minute 52.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour out of the game, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed Maxwell's focus.
This goal eliminated the hope of Malmo that they will rebalance the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the rejection of David Luiz maintained the final score before the new entry of Ezekiel Lavezzi to cancel a gap in the extensions.
Norwegian coach of the team in Malmo, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that “The last match I played in the Champions League was last December.”
Since then, I have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the fall in stock prices on the commodity market, gathered $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, quoted on the London stock exchange, said it sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is falling short of falling prices on the commodity market because China’s economic activity is affecting demand and causing market disaster.
Preferential right to subscribe increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
Actions rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of larger plans to cover almost a third of its debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than the closing price on Tuesday.
He took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Worrying at the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half and coal, copper and other goods decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists on the wider expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping said a group tasked with reforming that the economy must open more to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving openness policies," Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouragement of reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up which will identify sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
The state authorities will also weaken the controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services,” the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimizing requirements and fluidizing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of lawyers' rights of practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not content with the government's proposal to increase salaries by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the union leaders of Education have not reached any result, the government proposing a 10% wage increase, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase, from November, or a 20% increase, from December.
Discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
Today's government proposal did not please us, otherwise we would not have come in the position to summon the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today represents for us less than what we expected.

Over 100 stewardesses, fired because they were too fat
The airline Air India fires about 130 Stewarts and stewardesses because they are overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company has announced that the decision has been taken for security reasons and recent government regulators, but critics say that the measure is "ridical" and "sexist-sexisting", writes The Washington Post.
Mass concession is the most recent of a ten-year battle between company and full stewardess.
Weight limit for these dates from the 1980s, when Air India started using graphs with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardese considered to be "exceptional of overweight", as it "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the agility to perform emergency measures".
Stewardeses gave the company to the trial, won and were re-engaged, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to determine their weakness have failed," explains a carrier of the company.

Simona Halep is in front of a crucial decision for her career, she has to choose whether or not to work with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the program Adidas Player Development, the Australian technician being with the novel only at the important tournaments.
Simona only had words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to put himself in front of the capricious sportsman.
The program of the Adidas will end at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or whether to give up the collaboration.
We still don't know exactly what's gonna happen.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I can give an answer," Simona testified at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in today's tennis, he's demanding a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he wouldn't want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions' Tour in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania's national team last fall.
The former selectionist testified that he did not understand with FRF president Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially raise his salary to stay, but was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the national.
Then I'm sorry, I'm leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions in the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed its ideas too.
But I wanted to go.
If he really wanted me to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We have about 400 and something thousands of euros a year, will have about 600 thousand euros.
We didn't talk to Burleanus, but to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

Rare disease a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected of his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, could barely hold his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he didn't consume alcohol, he was clearly in a state of drunkenness.
When he first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family believed 'may as drinking alone, it's an alcoholic in secret'," he says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize, "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although he doubted for a while, finally went with him to the doctor's nummarates, remembered that Nick's breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's best thoughts on was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a three-time alcohol problem across the legal line, though one night before he had only consumed one beer.
After years and unnumbered investigations, it has been discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare illness, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, the body makes all carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this might be Nick's disease was even his wife.
The disease hasn't had a cure yet, but since he dropped out of carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had such an episode.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf pass
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, as a protest against the services he had in his dealer's office.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage for the car to be removed from use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, to the fun of those who watched him.
The man claimed that the car had defects that endangered his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car didn't solve his problem, as he had agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "still a stage in Romania's efforts to modernise the process of managing immigration in the national territory", according to a press release.
The above-mentioned source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect the policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems facing the countries in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the united management and coherence of situations caused by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants in Romania, generated by the political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with a potential migrationist or which may be detrimental to national security," the remembered source adds.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in neighbouring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous checks on the legality of the seat of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of removal measures and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to third-party citizens in Romania who respond to the needs of the labour force, promoting access to third-country citizens to higher learning institutions in Romania for the fields and professions identified as deficit.
Concerning the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it represents "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European labour market top
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded a high increase in the total labour cost of the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year compared to the similar period of 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employer staff expenses.
Thus, in the period April to June 2015, the total cost of the labour force rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third place in the EU at rising labour cost
The highest growth rates were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU states where the hourly cost of the labour force fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania from April to June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of the labour force in industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of the labour force.
TVR management activity report, rejected in committee: Stelian Tanase risking dismissal
Parliament's Culture Commissioners rejected the 2014 Romanian Television Society's Board of Directors' activity report on Wednesday.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted, one against the rejection (Mr Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaux.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be discussed.
"I believe that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Committee Chairman Georgica Severin.
He added that "was good sense" as the TVR's leadership was present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was good to feel like being in charge of TVR because no one here was subjected to any personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made by members as of last night, about an hour ago that we didn't even know about the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think when you're summoned, you're a budget employee, paid out of public taxes, and you're called to a meeting of committees even if you don't like to live.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Committees gathered by Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay out of the historical ones.
"I'll remind you that not because of me or someone else in these committees has lost that pleasure with the banks and the tax, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting they will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will choose the head general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will appear a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the House of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with a great deal of reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be if you ask me what quality you have to have - good sense in the attitude of the employees because it's a curse of little people coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you get such a session 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although it has not been presented to Parliament, the president-general of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, has sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requests that the Parliament consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the independent economic and political public television, including the number of them and the indexation of the TV tax.
In a letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to indexing the TV fee, the amendment and addition of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions at the level of technological change to the day-to-day level, as well as for the regulation of the procedure for controlling the TV fee and the finding of contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision to provide for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv agents to collect the TV tax by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in the incumbency.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and a contribution for CNC from 15% to 3%, but also the amendment of the law 41/1994, in the sense of being able to receive budget/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Cerb, Eurovision.
He claims that the SRTv will become incapacitated by payment in the following months, considering that labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"As a result, the travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," said President TVR.
He felt that the disastrous financial situation could not be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman Television will be, sooner or later, in the impossibility of fulfilling its public mission", is mentioned in the letter.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
Vasile Blaga's geniuses, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's genius, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Park next to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is charged with tax evasion, in a case with damage of approximately 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
He set up the Axis Corporate Security SRL guard, along with his mother in April 2009, a year after she married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of raising taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representatives of a company specializing in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, which would have evidenced the fictitious transactions.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have registered fictitious purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged with about 600,000 euros," explained the Roman Police in a press release.
The droughts have established Sanmartean's fate
Al-Ittihad's headquarters established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's Ittihad's separation is imminent, the entrepreneur of coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the game title and does it right.
The droughts also realized that he was the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been his choice to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come true," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Elijah Sarbu, deputy Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were recorded.
The vote was secret, with the ballots.
The LNP representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, says Digi24.
In addition, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this function and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, under the conditions that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Elijah Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
Senator PSD will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper follows to play the role of a chef in the movie "Burnt", the actor made a revelation to which his fans did not expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a chef."
He revealed that he worked in the kitchen since he was 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the entire childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd laugh at if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
Up to the age of 40, however, the actor acknowledged that he saw himself in the near future by directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who became the director at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slanders and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the statements of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning, according to which political decisions in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational claims, insults the entire Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister transmitted in a statement.
Civilised European politicians don't say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost his full support in internal politics in Romania," he added, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday night post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and punish the behaviour of high Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges that may arise from Hungarian government representatives.
"These are a disgrace for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions in the refugee crisis, appreciating that aggressive brutality and laws will not solve the problem.
The barren sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!" the chief of the Romanian executive stressed.
Previous Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, appreciating that these statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister of the Romanian internal political crisis and mentioned that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and say is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that everyone who comes here is terrorists, that's bullshit for the Middle Ages, and I'm totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with bat and insert.
"That's what I don't agree with," the Roman chief said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government of Budapest decided to begin preparations in the field for the extension to the border with Romania of the fence it builds at the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence does not solve anything about refugees and "get Hungary out of Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and Mecca's crane crash?
The Saudi authorities announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the crash of a crane on Friday on the Mecca's Great Mosque, an accident after which 107 people died.
According to an investigation commission, the company did not "respect the safety rules", reported the Saudi press agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation in this case was completed.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by the father of Osama bin Laden 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of Mari Mosche to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the east side of the Grand Mosque roof of Mecca.
After the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut up the protesters' mouth
Considered by the world's largest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was tagged after retreating from activity as a weak coach, who cannot be able to achieve performance and in the new position.
After unhappy experiences at the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he patronizes a year ago.
After a year of taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he is capable of turning a team that was struggling to rescue from retrogradation into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 offenders.
The billboard is one of a top team, fighting at the European cups.
Things took a much better turn for the Future this season, as the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader of Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (to equality with Astra), more than double than Stara.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have emerged.
The club's policy has made the Future a team for foreign teams, as Hagi sold in this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Apart from the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Register of Commerce.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the governing college of the Roman Center for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the police forces alone will not function in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best we can and adapt to them.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up the free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another age and that was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually hasn't solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to put a vote on the board.
All the predictions said he had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity is applied in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated into justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, applies, and the Council approves it by vote of 55% of the Member States, i.e. 16 which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it is a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have emerged even in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and did not want many countries to appear as a "EU-like reaction to send migrants to our heads".
They have therefore asked, but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably witness big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory odds were not really eliminated, but the subject was just let cooler?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece captivates, you can't always say it's Greece's job.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how compulsory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there is a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I do not think that the European States will take on the migrants: you go to the country X or the country Y.
It will probably reach some single filter centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They are countries that have tens of years of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenofob.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, the winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we were expecting next year to an even bigger wave.
What do we do with these people?
My prognostic is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it so catastrophicly in the media.
You were talking about cooler with smaller or bigger experience.
Do you think there is a place where the integration of large groups from a non-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Magrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other migration waves, but that doesn't mean they're not integrated at all.
There was an unintegrated part left that created major social problems in France, Germany, in the UK.
But purely political means won't work.
To create Europe's strength is illusory.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be addressed.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let's ask these people to learn their language, try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing their rest to the family including through marriages of convenience.
However, these people must be separated from the imminent problem of their long-term integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to look at them how they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to remake the country overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions are found, we see force within Europe.
The borders are closed, the walls are raised, border checks are reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as not so much, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built pretty minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where I put my foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're running around free, but each one of us has his own problems.
In front of such a wave can't be like that, because some countries don't face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more dramatic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets excited.
After public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the real European single market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there'll be other rules, that's different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted for the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which thinks that, if it pulls the cap on its eyes and stutters its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will fall greatly.
President Iohannis says maybe it's good that we're not in yet.
So we're moving from the despair of entering a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
That does not mean that we are no longer going into Schengen, but that we are more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
Ukrainian President said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means messing with Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without Putin's military and financial effort, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to crash before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
Two years was a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates focus of instability and chaos that it can't close.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to be offered, hit the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can sort of sort of solve the whole thing.
But I disagree with the theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon?
Millions of Facebook users have used the "Like" button, and now representatives of the socialization network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike" one.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, informs New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg has specified that the "Dislike" button will look more like a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The network users, who reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like that post," Facebook noted.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not welcomed by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social media," said Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article was posted with this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports it, the campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Only 70 migrants were accepted by Hungary on Tuesday, a hand of thousands who came to the table at its southern border with Serbia, and government councillor Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the refugee flow, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also entered Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being recorded and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
"The new" county council headquarters is crashing.
Two manufacturers, insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, are getting worse because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here came into insolvency during the work.
The county council building in the street Vasile Alecsandri will reach its own way.
One and a half years after work on building consolidation and refurbishment had been completed, the work did not reach half.
One last stage in the building's epic was consumed the past few days when the National Contestation Resolution Board (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the technical project contract for the work that is still to be carried out.
The original project was developed by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the manufacturer's insolvency entry and termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company will update the technical project and then a new tender for the works will be organised.
"The negotiations were not concluded, however, by a contract, with the CJ considering that the proposed form would be disadvantaged by the institution," Răzvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to discontinue direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to the CNS, which rejected it, as late as it was.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another projector.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNS decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be taken into account when considering the finding of another drafter.
Thus, work to strengthen the building could be resumed early next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the renovation of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNS decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The work to strengthen the former headquarters of the Police Headquarters began in 2011.
A first contract of works was rescinded in April 2012 after work of 4,5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed, with the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after 1.5 million lei had been paid.
The work has so far been carried out at about 50%.
Originally, the building's consolidation, refurbishment and atticing work had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I'm saying!" - the statement that could incriminate the ex-chief of the Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record at the Cadastre Office signed an acknowledgment agreement against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Office of Land Registry and Advertising (OCPI) Iasi accused of DNA in a corruption file acknowledged his face.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dăsălu was registered yesterday at the Iași Court, the judges determining to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dăcălu was accused of false intellectual in continuous form and agreed to execute two years of delaying charity as well as community work.
As regards the facts imputed to Dăcălu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, "has conducted in false multiple acceptance minutes, taking over the contracts of supply services in the first place by the O.C.P.I. and with the managers of the companies SC Gauss SRL, SC Grupo Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency of Ca dastro and Topographie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ştefan, which did not attest to the fact that the contracted services were carried out in full, under the conditions under which they were not carried out and were not filed at O.C.P.I. Iași".
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current OCPI employees were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Pre trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national handball female to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
Romanian Handbal Federation President Alexandru Dedu said yesterday in a meeting with the press that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this it has to go through two stages of caudine forks, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements on the part of the technical boss led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masons, goalkeeper coach, physical preparer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get some qualifications, specifically material for physical training, that we've never heard of.
These all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything I care about myself to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But that's the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we're fighting with have these materials and they've had them for some time," said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to be questioned by a European gymnastics championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world Olympic careers have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona, it was a waste dump, and now it has become a mark of beauty.
The same has happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics was a success and investment point of view.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaţu went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but they made it very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had talks with EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize, and they said that I agree and invite them to the first game in the new gym in Bucharest, and then we are talking concretely.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," Officer FRH explained.
The former big handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to arrive in the Four Final: "I asked all coaches to be reserved in prognostics, that if they fail they turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiști debuts on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the Romanian batch are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two wins: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at full speed.
We trained to deliver the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
However, if we win with Canada, the game with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup, it is the gathering of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, represent with pride the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romanian national team member Lynn Howells, first experienced in the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to attend the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me, it is very important that every game I make Romanians be proud of the national team.
Romanian Federation President Rugby, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last few years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish sportsmen success, and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in the teams of Romania at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set to realize a dream," Dumitraș said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, with the following matches scheduled: France on 23 September in London; Ireland on 27 September in London; Canada on 6 October in Leicester; Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the match England - Fiji in group A.

Registration takes place until September 30th, and those who wish to ask for more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: studentculture@gmail.com.
14 million lei give to the Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" in Iasi to correct the budget
What will be acquired with this important amount of money?
St. Spiridon Hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following budgetary corrections.
The money the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in work on modernization and planning of clinics, as well as in equipment and medical technique for which the hospital has already begun the procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped properly, ophthalmogic microscope and other devices necessary to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and planning of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the next few days we will receive the work from the bridge linking UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the UPU patient in the neighbouring clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the dermatology clinic in Tătărași, which it will organize in the ambulance, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area of allergology, haematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.

Pattery of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After your experience, neither I nor my wife ever wanted to step in your town again.
Without wishing to do so, they got hit by the erroneous information in the leaflets, by the nonsense of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "so-called the law".
The husbands arrived in Iași a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a flyer in which RATP routes were past.
"armed" with these maps, the husbands visited Jasul.
But two days ago, they were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket ticket in the station near Copou Park, they were based on printed information on the flyer: that they can take ticket by SMS.
No one has told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusters in the folding, they got on a bus and tried to send text messages after the instructions on the folding.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there was no service for two years and that the press was called off.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, coming one night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
Attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (my wife and mine).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting my stand at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!", Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the flyer and the controllers who "applyed the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not overreacted, but the point is I felt wrong.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and stayed in preventive detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has moved since yesterday to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The outgoing judges judged the first deadline in a non-public meeting in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl demanded that they be released.
Before the actual commencement of the trial, one of the outgoing judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for a stay, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The judge activated until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was president of the Section on Nale, who on 9 April admitted a protest by four defendants, providing for their detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which are part of the Maicica Mititelu and Geta Sandu judges.
Previously, in the file he formulated a restraining and judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubine relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges have decided that Vasului rapists remain in preventive detention.
Your blacks will remain in prison for at least 30 days, when they judge the books will re-dispute the possibility of their release.
The next sentence of the judgment shall be taken at the Court of Appeal Iași on 6 October.
Before reaching the Iași Court of Appeal, the van with which were transported the rapists of Vasului was involved in an accident produced in the district of Păcurari, the car entering the Iași on the belt.
The self-utilitarian Iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen wagen car that had come out of the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The Duba circle from the End of Păcuri.
The car entered Iasi around here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vasului to Iasi on the Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They have thus shortened the road a few kilometers.
Immediately after impact, the arrest escort called for another transport to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Maximum Safety Penitentiary Iași, who took over the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the nostrils, and the arrests went out in speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, as drivers of the motor vehicles have amicably understood the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Mădalin Tăranu of IPJ.
Great migrations
Romania is neither and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and widespread: the no 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize are, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the Romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary share proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinaryly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parazed by interlopes and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any colour were not able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent medical care, gather dirt on the street, create honorable jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they're fleeing from?
But what produces a great deal of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the bellicose pride of the powerful EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not accept the other - from another language, from another religion, from another blood.
Probably out of fear of stealing someone's national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be delayed.
Causes must be eliminated, they support some and, by strictly moving on to the book of political correctness, calling for peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosing, disparate and above-the-situation construction.
I was complaining that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but the EU does not have any future plans either.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
Then, what else does the EU use, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
Not the migrants' crisis, though.
In the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is neither and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, in practice, imposed
The concession award shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of detention, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literacy Museum is offered by the County Council for a 10 years concession.
The construction has a useful surface of 134 mp, on two levels of food.
CJ only accepts as destinations data from literary cafés, bookshops or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the tender starting value being 6,830 euros annually, with a tender rate of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously operate the building and fully cover the rehabilitation costs of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in advanced condition of degradation due to the fact that during the period in these spaces the public power plant has operated and neither after its evacuation have current repair and maintenance work been carried out as it is currently necessary during the operation of a building", is mentioned in the documentation relating to the tendering procedure.
The club's offerings are expected until September 18.
Two brothers from Tomeşti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tomești, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on a treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were taken emergency to the "Holy Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the dark of the '90s, when it had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family from Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young exit, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again the other day in Iasi with the biological parents of a village of the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of offering their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Iasi in Romania to get to know her unclear past.
"The Iasi Diary", who attended the family search efforts of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital in the city.
At home there were misunderstandings between parents, and Mom had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I haven't known anything.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Easter, and then the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were going to break up permanently.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After he was admitted, Crina's father went to work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"He thought she was abandoned," tells a granddaughter of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the child's fate at all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and the Protection of the Iasi child, who then gave it to the care of the Plasament Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more thinly regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while this would move permanently with them in Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities took place.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"Like my wife would have given her life," Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us, while catching in his daughter's slave hand.
In the country, the parents of Crimea, Alina and Costica, continued to separate the searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he received no answers where his child could be.
The police then sent her that she might be dead, but at Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their face.
When I looked her up here, they told the court that she was gone to Italy, Palermo.
And conditions to look for her I've never had before.
We asked God to be good.
I've been thinking about her for all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk around, to find her.
"It's hard," he tells us with tears in the eyes of the biological mother of Cinnamon.
But even if the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl from where she comes from and that her past connects her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," says Crina.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romique Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Iași, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crimea.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I only got one name, the Coastal Balkans, then the locality, the Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there was by locality the name I got.
That's when they gave me a few pointers, just that the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It lasted about a month until we found the girl's biological father," explains Chief Romique Ichim.
In total, more than three months they took the authorities to find the Costica and Alina, especially that each had a home in another town.
We started off somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," added Romica Ichim.
On the weekend that passed, Alina and Costiche first saw their lost girl in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, nervous, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He's just changing a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't even sleep.
He was all nervous, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," a granddaughter tells us, coming along with the Costica from Ruginosa.
Cinnamon's meeting with mother and biological brother
In talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costica Balcan told her, among other things, that if she ever wants to return to him, in the village, to come quietly: she can give him sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and to bury a household.
My mother is also nervous, crying, and she hardly thinks that something like this could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I was hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very emotional.
If only they could forgive me.
I hope to see you in the future.
"I hope we can maintain a bond," she says with great tears on the cheeks of Alina, the mother of Crina, while holding a napkin in her hand.
In him he hides his tears, of happiness, because in a short time he will see her face after so bitter a while.
On the other side, Crina, who will be in just a few days, this month, 20, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she outlined a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," confesses Crina.
First family meeting in Iasi
In the United Square, under the skies of early autumn, Ruginosa's family rejoins its destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I don't break up borders or countries, but just a barrier: language barrier.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iash, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind, and that in the future, if there is another opportunity, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional load, and I'm glad to be successful.
We at the Centre have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with the consumer, drug addicts.
But we're trying to redo some good company back.
"If I am still asked for such an event, I will do it with great love," says Romíca Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, departs by story.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with the guns on their feet, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The camps in the outlying branch of the PSD ended a truce with a gun on its foot.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Chaired by executive president of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Yemeni Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from having ended, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow combatants to shoot their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
In the October elections, a bitter competition is expected as chairman of the county branch of the PSD.
On the short list of potential candidates for the party's main position in the Yemeni branch are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councillor Vasile Quanta and Acting President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of the municipality Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the county councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu is no longer in the race, sources of the party claiming that he is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the recent negotiations is that of the former branch leader, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be nominated, and it wouldn't surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will also remain after October 3, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent County Bureau and all new management structures," said Quatala.
Until the internal elections are held, the management of the county branch of PSD will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until 29 September, preparing the elections in practice to be assured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with camp Nichita.
Contacted the phone, Cristian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions in the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
He reached a partial consensus in support of a unit team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of the candidacy to the President of PSD Iași, the list remaining open," Stanciu said.
A Yemeni judge denied the Vaslu rapist's file on grounds of cohabitation
The seven young people in Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Vasluii sentenced to five to eight months and eight years and four months will today present their arguments regarding their release, after the court of the merits, Vasului's Judgement, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was handed down.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for detention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the judges motivated the sentence
At the end of last week, the judge at Vasului Judgeship, who sentenced the seven young people, motivated the sentence.
The judge's motivation is to talk about the affronting reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The court finds that, after placing in the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a privatised measure of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the local and national community level about the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged to a lesser extent restrictive," says the Court of Vaslui.
The magistrates also demolished the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial claimed that the girl they raped would not be "church door".
"The court points out that the moral quality of the injured person is not relevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight by their defences, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it states in the explanatory statement.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Until Saturday perhaps little world knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering how much can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war Labour.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (at one point he asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), an anti-American ferocious and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the murder of Osama bin Laden a true tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States.
According to the model of all demagogy, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until the moment he breast-feeded the real world and economic ties.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader foresees, among other things, massive renationalisations and printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimously adopted on the world, we would then have a global prosperity!, but who else should prevent such details.
Of course, we can tax the blood on the bankers, become some kind of left service enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The extra amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point other people's money is over."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever get Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was still not as extreme in his convictions as the party's fresh leader, failed pitifully in the election.
And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extensive automations have made it necessary for the industry to be massively skilled, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest Financial Times issue, Corbyn's choice increases the chances of Brexit and the coming out of the EU of Great Britain.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical Brussels left is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with the anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that shakes from the EU's core, you get to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place until 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic capital loss for the whole European project and the deep faults created within it by the Euro crisis and now that is why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterponder to the Franco-German axis (where Berlin becomes the dominant actor anyway).
It's true, the British business environment, the city, are powerful lawyers of the country's stay in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a sample in Jean Cluj Junker's speech, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the head of the great majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And that happens under the conditions that electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Euroceptics increases spectacular throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with a negative charge has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where and the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation leaving the national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are going to see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is fueling their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in the oocidental societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-Immigration zone, both caused by rash decisions that have only taken account of the integrative political ambitions, not the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's situation more significantly.
And it's hard to rule out something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Cheeses: "Take and bake the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his reputation lies, however, something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of successful stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called "trud."
What to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What else is there to say, in fact?
The figure has appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising video.
The cheeses produce and deliver money almost 60 years after it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brâncuși."
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Even communists failed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His quotes today push the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else would be to say, to write about this man?
Watched from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstitute his destiny, Brâncusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven't been lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family as strong as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterpart.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe that's where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Look at the cretin success stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how he made it alive, how, today, by him he heard a whole world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the commune of Peștişani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Mary and of Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncus led a modest life, but one of which would pick up the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Túțea from Paris, 1933: "So life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people led, happily, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from season to season.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brâncusi's childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments in these first years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the birthplace.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879 Constantin Brâncusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the túica "la casan" was made, following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going properly, the Brâncuși caught a moment of general non-attention.
He fills his palms with his tummy and drinks on unsuffered.
He falls into his sleep almost instantaneously.
The first people barely notice it a few minutes later.
My mother panics, then hysteria, believing her son died.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by the whips, he sees from the distance the desperate signs of those who wait for him with their soul in their mouths.
The party immediately turns into jale.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds that it's good to call Baba Brandasha, the doftoroaie and the servants of the Brâncuşi.
The cheese checks the child's breath, then puts him under a horse's nose, gathered around.
The baby sneezes strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further his drunkenness, of joy, the party with the whips continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet by levada.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine gather some knots and bring them to him.
The father sits his baby head down and, with the knots brought by the boy, beats him to keep in mind.
And while he feels the stumbling of the blows, little Broncousi has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that the things around can appear twisted.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as he would recognize at old age, if somehow he does not himself participate in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?.
At present, the city is not working
A parliamentary calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop domestic struggles and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big gap and so on.
I haven't seen anything from the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible locations depending on their real estate interests.
Let's leave politics a little aside, get together and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Blajut said.
He appreciated the fact that the current political class has disillusioned the Yemeni electorate, the consequence of which will be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the loyal electorate of the parties.
He also believes that the voters will still focus on the traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the party "for Iasi" which will be launched today.
The local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"It crumbles even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blojuţ.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidate in the upcoming local elections, discontinuing his intention to join the City Hall race.
I've already said that I don't want to run for any local office.
I think about whether to continue as a Member and in the future mandate.
I tried to appeal to the Iasi unit and in the lobby talks with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make my picture.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blăjuț, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tătăraşi said he's not getting his money and he has to ride the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
It's not a small amount of money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the money from the locker.
At the end of the term of office I will report on everything I have spent, outside the salaries of the employees at the office and their maintenance.
I happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and so on.
"To say a parliamentarian that he doesn't get his money is a clean hypocrisy," Bléjut ended.
