Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will be landing in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summum in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the very centre of the Committee.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award ceremony.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who leads a war in two countries at the present time.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to highlight.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet, including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He has also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
Upon the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police charged the president of the Association Société des protectors de la nature de Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked for money from investors for their personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and at risk of imprisonment for up to three years.
Waste sorting buckets are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort out their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right buckets.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into the city center?
It is a science that requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I found for the moment is Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I find it sacred little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a safe one either.
So finally, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
Betrayal.
It's a trick for them to get to the bottom of the buckets.
I'm not surprised about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw out a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any color buckets on Koicava Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing with it.
It is after all the center of Brno, who is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called esthetism are not too interesting to Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy in the city a spot in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and proposing the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the internet.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has removed money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Edward Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government's borrowings for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting back problems later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It is important to know that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice to find out where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditures, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those on the left that has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their retirements or their health insurances, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year there will be no shortage of $163 billion in funds, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow faster and with her, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repair it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be a shortage of five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and that cannot be amended to reduce the costs if necessary.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka's warning, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very well - it will draw on the dividends of ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electric energy), which the state has to a large extent and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and in no case is it a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion have been sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or to provide a reserve for the reform of the pensions being prepared.
Moreover, this tip increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The minister will then have to save money from the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million for the two-billion State Fund project, which must be able to track on-line the expenditure of each government.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you'll switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alter between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and was made a first demonstration of it a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not come under fiction at all.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new mobile phone technologies is booming.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current 2012 devices.
The snow shortage in the mountains plows the hoteliers
The deserted slopes do not pose a problem only to uplifters.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have many visits on our site.
Netizens travel through offers, demand prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the time being.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book.
If savings are given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes next, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindler are offering only one week's stay for the New Year.
I think they'll try another moment to put them in, but they'll die too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will decrease rapidly," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours tourism agency of the Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We're most interested in Christmas week for the time being, it's not completely sold.
There's still half the rooms left in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute less expensive Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of the Vrchlabí can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The fourteen first days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks recover during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the other hand, the occupancy of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last seats left for the New Year as well as Christmas.
There is great interest during the holiday of January of Poles and February also sells itself," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already had sixty percent occupation at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will grow again certainly indicated the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the Krkonoše hoteliers must not expect more snow.
Thursday it will make cooler and if there are precipitations, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But then, the weather should warm up, inform Jiří Jakubský of the station of Hradec of the Czech hydrometaorological institute.
United States: Rehearsal is a mother of wisdom
He becomes even comical, the sharp effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of the wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered to be simple.
When he finally let his doctrine transpire so ardently expected, it turned out that he had recovered it to carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, what is more, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful at such a point that the newspapers at present do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a far more favourable final situation than one could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
It is again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but if there was no better option, he had at least crushed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had 10,000 originally.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to remove the armies of Afghanistan in 18 months' time and complete this process in three years' time. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruits as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be counted and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders on a daily basis according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relation to relations, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of war in view of their "soon return home" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is merely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions strengthened have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem through the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond to this when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only shame for Obama is that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
Top-ranking employees of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
Society has announced it to respond to strong criticisms of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from the leadership if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus stands at the forefront of the effort to link wages with long-term performance to Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after almost $17 billion was set aside for prizes over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the banking sector's strong premiums have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to assign a single fee of 50 percent to bankers' bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
There are five women, a record number, who have received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical and literature disciplines.
Besides the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been awarded this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the cash reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been given this afternoon to US President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy he added that in certain situations war is indispensable for obtaining peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Finance Minister Edward Janota on Friday morning, who will put his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
In his view, the deficit is too large, which further widens the crisis in public finances.
Presidential spokesperson Radim Ochvat reported on the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left, the government, Klaus and the right hand side, which calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the MPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and that it is expected to owe the government debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not require anything, said today in a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unreproachable deficiency" of public finances.
Now, in his view, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could build on a broader political party consensus, according to the President.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is flawed and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer functioning.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The leader of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is horrifying and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday already, ČSSD has successfully described the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose the world to a lot of things about the country, its struggles and its victories.
The story speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, embodies the film on Nelson Mandela's life, untiringly fighting against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a Mandela, 80-year-old mandela, who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally."
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the box, for example, has incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery itself as a slave, a president of the fictitious USA, even God in the All-Powering Evan film but never someone else alive and as important for as many people as is Mandela.
The former South African state man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invaincu and it is the title of an English author's poem William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela is newly elected knows that his country is still and always racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is persuaded to be able to unite his people by sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the world's outsiders.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to a large screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in order to bring it closer to the most of reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover from your energy, it transmits itself, and I felt like knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under director Eastwood's houlette received positive opinions and even talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
The newspaper Daily Variety's critique of Todd McCarthy films summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the evaluation of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she damaged herself in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the equipment.
It's clearly the third-floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be justly set on fire of a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flying object not specifically identified was likely to have been by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket were resisted and the fault only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the trial launches went unabated, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost 50 percent therefore employs the generals of optimism and therefore they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with Moscow CSKA at 51 years old.
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again present himself in a professional match at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a hand to his Moscow CSKA team in need and will make his entry probably already during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is for the time being the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliah's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the shape, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the agency AP.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are capable of strengthening the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of her return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champions, he won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also paid tribute to NHL, where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels every overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a post-mortem for the day worked on November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for extra hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their end-of-year holidays told Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car factory employees were forced to work almost every day for two hours in more than eight hours.
Trade unions plan to cancel the strike after the agreement has been signed.
The next negotiation between the direction of the car factory and the unions must take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signing a common document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to unceasing overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wages and so-called bizutage.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also asked that workers who have ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a payout of 5,000 kroners (about €209) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes the lead in the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the current variants of the virus as well as on some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the lives of the sick can be dramatically extended through a mix of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption results in a number of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "enhanced" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links on the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiwalled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in samples as well as its resistant variants obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to develop effective HIV drugs, says Pavlina Žezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Disputed around the budget. The SDO takes on Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year, and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has described the SDO's proposals as a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
The spokesperson for ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer worked.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to give the House of Deputies support to the minority concerned in the fight against the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for amendments totalling 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the amount of money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and unavailability
Finance Minister Edward Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his visit to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered whether he was going to remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason for that.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD representatives, who imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not at issue.
This is the case of the Chief of the Fischer Government and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did not do anything harmful, said Topolánek in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments requested TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I did not think about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO went back to the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked Democratic Members to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not children, he responded to the question of whether the SDO had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when the budget was negotiated.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be the Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, I reacted to Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December certain less loaded express or regional trains and will, on the contrary, strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decline on the day of entry into force of the new two-percent schedules compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, and the railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an expression will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent in total, while Prague and its environs can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Miloice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Miloice must change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which can be opened thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Miloice.
The lines far to the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave for two hours intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not resort to an increase in the price of the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will affect only one day's ČD Net tickets and the eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of a selected region and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children were released
The rebels today abducted 75 people south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed them, but spoke only of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when fleeing to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement to release remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the rapists as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Magundanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the South Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the American theatres in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen by Mandela himself years ago to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the return of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparation for the coupe of the world of football, and on the other because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination among the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to AP, the reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavanate".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of his own words.
I've dreamed of this long-year role, and I've been well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times in order - as they say - to recover from his energy, he said during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual it has added.
Wearing the shirt from the national rugby team
The film, based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin, is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people, portrays the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman therefore tried during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he dressed the South African team's national jersey on the world cup lawn, which South Africa had won at that time.
To have shown himself on the lawn in jersey, which is considered to be something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been extensively ovationated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again in one nation, said Rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are skeptical as they have recently been entrusted in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of kroner flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps of the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the firefighters of Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally expected to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured and according to Pavla Mandatova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyer must be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has not known anything of the same and that such incidents are isolated.
The electricity supply has not been interrupted, says ČEZ Spokesperson for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission and power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport sets to the distribution sets and line traces of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD Prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of the Student Agency, will now file a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic Prefects.
And in concrete terms against Michal Hašek from the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc Martin Tesařík region.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the company Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had done so in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is a follow-up to his media show that serves him as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and lying arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to the threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't quit, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who he is but I will not say his name, Jančura said today in Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will overthrow old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices for health insurance for vaccines.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children from August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for one dose.
Vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Specialists believe that health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns each year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
To date, the State has spent approximately 500,000 crowns per year for all immunization of children.
The paid vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age are caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries introduced paid-up vaccination.
Is vaccination mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible requirement for vaccination in the future.
As from January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad we were able to impose at least this.
I believe that this is a direction that must now be followed, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococcals.
We do not consider it at all for the time being, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteerata its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, there could be a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum, I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," said Cabrnochová.
Specialists predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcals also marks a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving them on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
However, this is linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Flight Museum"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of attempting to steal pictures worth $20 million (12 million GBP) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used mechanical leather to force the entrance to the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by family quarrels.
According to a police statement, Mr.Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied having given such permission, said the agency.
Labour is defending the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in tax and the reductions in spending announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "failed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, there is a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public salaries from 2011.
Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will achieve about GBP 3 billion a year - has made companies angry, because it believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by still 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the corporation's tax on profits for small corporations was abandoned
Charges for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These numbers are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would likely decrease by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the pre-estimation estimate.
"Opportunity missed"'
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the GBP 789 billion project over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers were unable to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" emitting difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary at the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour stresses that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, said that the announcement schedule - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, with money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Unbudgeted"
Although ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Études Fiscales) affirmed that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said his director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates "American Arrests in Pakistan" · Global Voices
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the American embassy in Pakistan, told the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in Virginia's U.S. state last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani ancestry, one Egyptian heritage and the other Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what are the charges against them and under what conditions they are held," said Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, Spokesman of the FBI, said the agency had known about the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington stated that men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already guarded by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but said that the United States should "co-operate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to unravel the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been missing from their home by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to Amnesty International's report.
the report presents "repetition of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticism of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fause Confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook Networks' and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half-conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small spring ahead of a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the top view of the runway was magnificent, but it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents", he added.
Prices have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book presents a much larger and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
These are the practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardians so virulent of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He is aware of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by hunting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then brave aspiring for 14 years who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous performance brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always one millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that lay in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorists use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not a mistake to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer trips provided the first information on the source of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the underlying relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hard men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tributary system, formed by the water nets pressed into ice cream.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn."
Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class of 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson took a seven-hour bus trip to lay down a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that came to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of the veterans in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the Memorial for the victims of United Airlines flight 93 to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation Foundation provided more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embittered in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers have declared.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held their hands, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Close by, he planned silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the present wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others hung to see the small black and white information cards, sunk in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many tearing mothers on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and had taken eight hours to come to gather on the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget because of what we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, and has affirmed the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana try to have access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges were not made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the communist rule of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which continues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward through concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often need to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attaché with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be authorized -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas Program of the Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States at the time when the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan in order to kill US troops, saying that they hoped that this case would enable a major network of terrorist recruiters who are hiding the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed that they hunted a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of north-east becoming a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrators.
Therefore, they were rejected, a representative of the authorities said that they would remain anonymous because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining the people who give their trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barkeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely investigated by al-Qaida.
But they are also very appealing to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the United States-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention in recent years to the choice of persons they accept because US secret services have become experts with regard to their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate these groups, what better way to follow his recruitment model than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen are calling for "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have marched on the streets here on Saturday, asking for more climate action from the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center congresses of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened during the climate discussions sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have marched from the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the country's tearing problems because of the impact of climate change already occurring."
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to join the great march -- to get the word out and call on world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothes lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, a representative of China for climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I didn't realize.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between breeds
Last week's federal report on mathematical results brought good news to the Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the top schools, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Education Progress show the continuing gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their Afro-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of the African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results as the sample was not significant enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I don't jump joy at one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (apparent democrat), D.C. Council member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (primary school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the test results message is that middle schools (colleges) in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what's scary is that we don't spend enough time and energy on our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren at the end of the elementary cycle and beginning of college who did not integrate the reading bases earlier into their school careers and who are rather late than their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten classes (material) in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were put in place in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students below the level of the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with lower results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington's poorest neighbourhoods.
Therefore, this targeting can have a political impact that hinders this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considers to be a "point of departure" for a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and flashes a moment's eye to the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of an impressive new student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed herself who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them towards the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says dreamy, when she was told the low ratio professor of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh time that children were visiting during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where they became parents in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands of them who will benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" of fiveprinciples his studies in high school -- a notable success if it is considered that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing the high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study beaters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (preparing you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are currently playing a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with participation in only two of the 10 auction fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had made an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the auction fields in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the oil sector opening in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and European companies that are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, an information site on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another bid is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, slowed US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil stock in the world, analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more likely to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Ministry of Iraqi Oil and have brought it their technical advice, have divided empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more to contract than other companies and has gone with significant participation in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power," said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected for auctions made bids that were then compared to the barrel tariff that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared the US counter-spying authorities Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murderous attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
The representatives of the authority stated that the local suspect militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally unhindered bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the al-Qaida military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, affirmed one of the authorities that wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a not-for-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate with extensive allegations of corruption during the Presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase, but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military Powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but that he would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives said that Staffan di Mistura was mentioned; he was a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who had recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that the accusations of Galbraith -- who was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of scepticism with regard to the international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to authorize his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations hiring regulations hindered his ability to bring new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world's great powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midfielder of 300 US soldiers north of Iraq, during a one-week visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the eventuality of such a outcome. ̈
One of the things that bothers me most is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "her people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the Spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of building trust on both sides and gaining time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have moved away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the escalation of Iran in the face of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement at the beginning of October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of additional major sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world Powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for Kurdish's rich oil region to meet with the Troops Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delay in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurds regarding the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy in a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In the aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by a poster of propaganda embracing them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby is an additional grave".
They have learned so well the lesson that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed at the underborn rate of their city and the aging of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no seconds left, said Wang, 31-year-old Human Resources Director, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of single children notoriously with good toys and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive Mitigation
The Chinese policy of the single child, drafted in 1978, is, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities attributed the duty of the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of authority forced pregnant women from a second child to be aborted.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city's government has deployed family planners and volunteers to meet couples at home, and to slide leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the head of the family planning, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say that they saw an increase in requests for couples wanting a second child after the start of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and government life insurance.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Westerners wrongly consider that the single child's policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
That's right, we're stealing the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of them. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more loudly.
For couples working with two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish even if they succeed.
People 20 or 30 years old have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early times of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child asks a lot of time for his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too much sacrifice.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has been brought back under the light of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the load, in the coming days.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as far as it has clarified the path to be taken.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a special United Nations working group, the text did not say how rich countries would provide the poor with support for climate warming in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative at Washington, Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General on United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture."
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal amendments have taken place, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration became harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from the major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after China's foreign minister, He Yafei said that the US chief negotiator, either lacked "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The present battle is more about the rescue of individual economies than the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the two dozen of the most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a representative from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to find out who would be facing the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states "has put a political pressure on the complete political process", in part because of what they are now unified and that they ask the emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the problems in progress before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be examined during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congrès every day -- guitar activists perform night shows that are mocking countries that they think are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for the global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km/h train will redefine Monday's syndrome.
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle blow will blow at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will drive from Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first train of Javelin suburb outside London.
He hoped that the new service would allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburban cities, the business journeys will be much less long and the passage of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of dangers to the environment could slow down British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will make its document available to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-West Midlands line will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 metres from the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a higher-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in an Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennsylvanias to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hourly trip.
The proposals will allow the journey to 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow 400m long trains that can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails in northern Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure that the aircraft are passing through the trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 for the Tory Oranges
Alan Duncan, the principal member of Tory parliament, has paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orange tree that he built in his riding home.
The party leader who was demolished by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "maintained," increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a review of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "more clear or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons regarding his pre-arrival provisions.
The Committee innominated him last month for any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the 271.406 GBP loan of his London property to the home of his constituency that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The variable standard interest rate RBS increased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Chief of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after a covert journalist filmed him saying that the members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "of the m..."
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked for more than that, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of fees that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of £ in M Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had applied for GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the office of fees and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of error or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the calendar of the Brighton Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using as a theme the songs of Noel.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Noel songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent this through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred calls.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, 100 thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, which was responsible for reaching an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate around the world, illustrated by these events, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the departure of the courtroom, when a group of 300 protesters, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with a beating and hammers, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-Emuseum police officers immediately intervened homeless.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violent groupsuscles, which had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were called "without distinction", stressing that about 100 of them "were always held on Saturday night street "menatized and held in a position sitting despite extreme cold".
Parliament party, the courtship, rather a good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, a negotiating site.
Protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to get into it.
A scene had been set up to accommodate the intended speakers, before a candlelight wake with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by car and by train from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the benign singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry out in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alternative-day movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, barking bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of hundreds of protesters also took place to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "face".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the Abkhaz Electoral Commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five high school candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the poll.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regretes that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regarded it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the Presidential region in this sumptuous landscape, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located in this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has given warm welcome to Russian officials who have come to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhaz's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, as giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: events around the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on whom they live, called for nearly 700 people on the margins of a huge demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, seeking an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the court, generally good child, has taken the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
Protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to get into it.
A scene had been set up to accommodate the intended speakers, before a candlelight wake with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of a few hundred protesters, entirely dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-Emuseum police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened homelessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violet groups that had shown themselves, among other things, at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a policeman was wounded in the jaw by a paved car and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We saw the extremist groupuscles, had warned the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by car and are in the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the benign singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry out in Africa, there are streams where you can walk while you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alternative-day movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, showed, dressed in red and plowing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of hundreds of protesters also took place to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The history-geo is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
First class students will now have all four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-files of the S, he continues, pointing out again: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of the history-geography in terminal in the lycées technologicales".
On Saturday, an Ifop survey in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69 per cent) French disapproved of the government's plan to abolish the compulsory teaching of history-geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some elected right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their view sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, said the Minister.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as trainees.
If you add all the courses proposed before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours, it has continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist at national education".
He also reaffirmed the project to delete the school map "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street's École Normale Superiore.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, noted a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and gives them a desire to know more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the one given by the students to the fish from the school pool.
Some 20 speakers were chosen from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he said, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school's website as of December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison overseers' unions called on Friday for "general capitalization" to require the payment by the end of the year of overtime and bonuses paid to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked the staff who will not be in service to manifest in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and to "block" them, to "dict theft of their dues".
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "honourable and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (UFAP/Unsa), "calls on the general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Corrections Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and has not all been budgeted, but ensure that the relics will be paid in January.
The Chancellery indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not aware of the efforts of the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the head of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of extra hours does not recur in the future, adds Mrs.Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be thin, except for management staff with the famous job and objective premiums, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, the FO Interregional Union of Marseilles was indignant, announcing its decision to boycott to a new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if October's days are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
By the time our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take them to the expense of the staff, the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less crowded than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "more pampered structures" than those he receives.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with the White House, entrusted the "paper" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things more fun than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end-of-the-year holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Father Christmas also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama signed up against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Surely not, I offered you nice gifts last year," she tagged the president.
Absolutely, he was obliged to grant before he replied with humor by showing his finger the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a fervent support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It was only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I didn't really know how to organize a house so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-opted, RTL claims he's in artificial coma.
Johnny Hallyday was re-opted in Los Angeles because of important "injurys" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opted on Wednesday through Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "injury resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris of his press service, stating that these lesions had "needed a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, was reassured that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be sent by 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, he adds RTL.
Interviewed by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also asserts that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a highly known physician in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for a consecutive intervention infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but he assured himself that he would not be "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He had just called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a mess because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to reassure himself, claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "indeed".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had met with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated on a "small colon cancer," then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving on stage.
By mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalled at the Worlds-2009 in large basin, won Thursday an international title on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a defrosting.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other by Russia in relays 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who lore on the record of the 50 m free world, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queens of swimming, 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers started out against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better, and in any case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had received the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of combinations has not this time served the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he held on 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't really get into this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophage, having belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola, was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, clearly above its estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long on 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", had explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice President of the Art Auctions of Roman and Egyptian Antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most expensive so far, a spokesperson from Sotheby's Dan Abernethy told the AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his private Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of the Maréchal Pétain.
It remained a shadow zone of some 50 years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this sign was part of a "success Emile Zola" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted departure aborted from Honduras Zelaya to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's plane departed to his place of origin, according to a source of the Migration Directorate General.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "design" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe conduct.
But the President-in-Office refused, because he wished to go to Mexico as the head of state in a guest exercise.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wanting me to quit my office (...), they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya on Globo radio Thursday, on which he has often expressed himself since the start of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has presented us with a request for safe driving, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as the president of the Honduran people, he said.
Mr. Zelaya's initial rumours had mobilized the supporters of the fallen president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
When exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Embassy of Brazil.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to answer the crime of "high treason" of which the accusation of justice, according to the putschist government.
The putschist president Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street mounts, the trade balance of the USA fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures showing the resumption of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, with dominant technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was assigned to it 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial said.
But it remains anecdotal, it has tempered, considering that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit declined by 7.6% in October compared with September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the opposite of a deficit gap.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, Christopher Cornell commented, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, the new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against all expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
Ten-year bond yields increased to 3,482% compared to 3,423% Tuesday night and 30-year bond yields to 4,492% compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the power conspire the "Dames en blanche"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired Thursday of the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which some ten dissidents were called upon.
About forty "White ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were conspired on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro government as they marched to the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP found.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, the raised fist, supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to provide their protection.
The day before, a similar demonstration took place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Hawaiian neighborhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the international human rights day were, they, questioned by police in civil, found a journalist from the AFP.
Police officers forced dissidents who were conspired by government supporters into civilian vehicles, according to this journalist.
The questioning of dissidents under similar circumstances usually lasts only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners," 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
Mr Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained locked.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
As a rare event, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "contra-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forcibly killed an octogenarian with the knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
One forcible armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor reportedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy at the 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a leader of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital following his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took it from a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The days of the other wounded are in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and allegedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the control of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have wounded two passers-bys, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a quadrangarian, the latter severely.
The screenplay was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried cross behind his back, explained on the spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, have attempted to control the forcible, based on the testimony of the AFP.
I saw a guy about 30 years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was a tough guy, so Alberto reported, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, including their officer, tried to challenge the armed man and were wounded by fisting, according to the police sources.
The events took place in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main arteries, where there are many shops.
Some passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person out there.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the floor, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person of about thirty years arrived, wounded with knife strokes.
These are National Police personnel who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office has before the investigation the Departmental Judicial Police Service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forge was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in connection with his custody.
A police source did not rule out his being placed in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" as "all those who were forced into this species whose forces are decapitated by the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecutions
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again called for the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of mills older than 30 years, in Los Angeles, California, west of the United States.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianiste", denounced to three judges of the appeal court of the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has passed away since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious flaw in procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and sought), of the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared late September to have "lieed" the documentary's author.
In the event that the court refused to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before the sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Mrs. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while scorning her authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel wasn't the only one who asked to quit the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "Person in this room cannot say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street runs out of direction, stalled by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday, in a market drawn from better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, with dominant technology, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-planned economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers rose significantly in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a further rise in the dollar, which has been at the top of the euro for two months, which "lays down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Deutsche Bank's Owen Fitzpatrick.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year bond yields increased to 3.540% compared to 3,482% Wednesday evening and the 30-year bond yield to 4,497% compared to 4,492% the day before.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month of trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great Mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already landed their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta del México, Mariatu Karglo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma du Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and experienced so many things!, Miss Sierra Leone exclaims.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to surrender my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, points out Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and rediscovering "the landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press and safari meetings, the Misses now focus on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of which became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream of being crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costumes and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss Monde Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time cycling, and tasted local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not running for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I went to people I never thought I could get close to.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his hospitalized father's bedside for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, said to the press David Hallyday at his exit from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 locals (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he was going to visit the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "enjoyed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-opted overnight from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade was schooled, to attend a school show, noted a photographer from AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salvêtre, Yves Catone, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outlawed, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "too fast leaving for Los Angeles, with permission from the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it surprised me, since I myself had two discal hernias, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts.
He had performed the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor of sulfur reputation, condemned on several occasions by justice, in cases of medical responsibility, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the medical lawyer, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursued "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had "perfectly well developed" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum the New Centre no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the OPA attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the label of the former Giscardian party, while remaining unable to use it on any medium, for prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, claiming that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, has left his silence to launch a petition to the minister and the MP, summarizing them no longer to use it and to pass on the property of the brand to them, subject to prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to +repreneur+ the UDF symbol, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuris of the centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow up on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, today's +UDF slogan, also see the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which insists the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (his) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (the) mark to its legitimate right-holders".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, preventing signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "has been a political movement in its entirety since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
In their view, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 for its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the trade mark," he was not "more of the UDF's membership for three years", but at the UMP.
It seizes scandalously and fraudulently from the absence of deposit of the UDF acronym to carry out it on its own.
This indelicateness is becoming a crime, denouncing it, before ironizing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he took advantage of an octogenier's weakness to spolie her part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a proper trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear themselves up while holding the reins of the empire of the cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any event not in accordance with the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated on Friday will have to report by March 10, 2010 saying, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt has been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she's going to submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said at the hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who touches everything, who has been accused of taking advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-standing friend.
While the court was to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, counsel's pleas sometimes turned to the great family disbandment on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor again felt that the complainant was not eligible for action, especially since a guardian judge has refused in recent days to be entitled to her request to initiate a legal protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place," said the Public Prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms.Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been fu...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises towards its employees, recalls the position of businesses vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preferences returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenue totally contradicts.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – will encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
From the large engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the "nerosciences" of the United States and widely disseminated, to them, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to manipulate the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent survey of Ipsos appeared in The Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, inadequate to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises implies adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists in incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Reasoned Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and transfer their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "Just War" is worth the praises to Obama
On Friday, the American right welcomed the speech delivered in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had misled the award to Mr.Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice-president's candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the wing of the right wing of the Republican party, to the USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done a very good job in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of the "existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this all-in-historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to have seen "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen converted chronicler to Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always did", "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few to the right not to be convinced, a falcon of the Bush era, former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, called the speech "land, ampoule and no inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the left hand side of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is wrapped up in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The central-left press, however, remained commendable to the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize has been awarded prematurely to Mr.Obama, has described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily became hot.
Obama "decided the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and uplifting."
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon-negotiation sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that put an end to the slogan of a strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoked" of this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left early in the morning on Friday, hoping to sign the agreed text quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same thing if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours for a meeting that began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was to be feared that it would disturb the end of the years holidays," Mr. Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for the low-wages, "are increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we go far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to give the order to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades of the refueling centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of general road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft Financial Amending Law for 2009, which was passed on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same way".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first instance to companies that are members of this organization, and in the second, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest possible time," assured Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "deposit market", because the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to counter the turkey feeders of the next awakening, deplored the U.S.A.
For the Other, the agreement is "probleming the collapse of a very large number of SMEs in the sector within the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unsatisfied unions of RATP proposals
The disruptions on RER A, France's largest urban transit line, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday to the 2nd day strike between unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their premium request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of pre-Christmas purchases, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, due to one train on two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one on four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that "RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores."
The RER A crosses west of it is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Valley.
On Friday, about one train on two has flown at peak hours, and almost no branch in hollow hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians had organized themselves.
So in the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequented than ordinary, especially because of the absence of collegians and lycées.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "one hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
Saint-Lazare Station did not experience any saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left St.Lazar station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon, "slow" by the unions.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its proposals for premium in parentheses, said the CGT, stressing that the management "was not prevented from solving a problem while on roads and SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
Which also told the unions that the company "was mocking the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a settlement committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a matter of calming" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 vary (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all second in career, reach from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for scheduled shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Disbands the Pro-Kurd Party, Serious Consequences Decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdian party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just held the hands of the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "house of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the President of the Court Hasim Kiliz told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr Kiliz, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banished from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Party's Treasury of property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Her leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as non-labeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
A number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The ruling of the Court intervenes when the government has just held hands with the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to attempt to undermine the support of the Kurds to the PKK and to put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a surge in tension in Southeast Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK Abdullah Öcalan have erupted in clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Upon the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populated mostly of Kurdes.
The forces of the order fired tear-off grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
Some 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of Justice was "to deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurd, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the government's democratic openness, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants, it's a tough winter.
But the person responsible for the de-billing and sanding service of the roads (FES) clearly states that it is not to embarrass the citizens.
It is simply so that officers can test the technique of vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologist, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and ice.
The EDF is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explained that as soon as it snows on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures descend below zero, large sand vehicles travel through 20 main routes (called routes A) .
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and walking streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road foundation that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That is why the FES service begins at 3:00 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migration begins".
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow goes down at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, tells us the person in charge of the road clearing and sanding service "because no motorists are willing to let the salage vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - like Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's pedestrian team is on its way to prioritize the areas deemed dangerous and the crossings.
As for the cycle tracks, the FES services generally cannot take care of them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22h and 4h30.
As the verglas form very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also possible that the police call on this special service in need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae was similar to the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was filled with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with flawed claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the supercontinent's land, the Pangeé and was toward the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, he informs us about the parenting, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells us that sometimes they were able to find a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named him Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it allows to confirm certain theories concerning the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at the time when the sauriens were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivorous) that include tyrannosaur and velociraptor appeared later and whose descends the birds, the sauropods, quadruped along their necks, and those that are related to them and the Ornithischian herbivores that are part of the species such as triceratops and stegosaur.
According to studies by St. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theologians.
This species presents an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found clues that suggest that Tawa hallae possessed small airbags in her bones at the skull level, as well as birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in their bones.
As the related lineage of the immense sauropods also had airbags and light bone, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saris had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have been divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world, i.e., all the land that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot come down from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner from the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There were, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaur, which lived in present Poland and which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken view because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age as they derived from a relatively rare collateral line from the branch of reptiles, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with ancestors of current crocodiles and many other saris.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived at random while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better suited, so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite to the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since that time had been in the shade: these were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, University of Vienna or Berkeley University in California.
There are professors at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with Protestant students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the police intervention demanded by the university's governing committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art were barred from graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories felt that the deterioration did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police force against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable damage" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee was thus removed from discussions that would be essential.
Court officers require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradations.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity of the students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of the Greens Union Youth.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she has taken action and cause for action by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the place is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but we do not accept vandalism, said MP CDU of Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition's parliamentary groups SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche party (Link)
Instead of thinking about the student's arguments and demands, they are being evacuated.
The La Gauche party tabled a motion that is the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place to search for the secret weaponry, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd created links with Riedberg, the place of the Frankfurt sciences – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Close Collaboration Protocol".
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will leave for a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet institutes and research companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the great firm Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For his supporters this is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than burying a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The main railway stations, with roads that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the effect of modern rail traffic braking sabotage because it took a long time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what to do.
This is why linehead stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train transit station, which is located about half way on the Trans-European Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been not compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the linehead stations do not pose any more real problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with motorways and car pilots at both ends.
However, we are now launching Stuttgart 21 next to the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and community policies have taken it away.
The railway company is part of the railway company because it is the taxpayer who makes the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urbanist point of view, this project is relatively justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the railway system the S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people which was attributed - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time there was not yet competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, relates indirectly to many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be engulfed in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been constructed at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to put a strong push here on the mushroom.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabotage.
The Rhine Valley route is on the way to becoming the bottleneck in international trade, which is at the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment rendered regarding the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal's judgement concerning the ban on night air flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal on a legal basis, which was a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation regarding the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land 17 planes between 23:00 and 5:00 a.m., as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisance.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this delay and tries to put pressure on the representative of the government to make the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is sacredly difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Land's government is still trying to allow night-flights by using "advocacy and roublardy."
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its part on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks repay the aid allocated
The big American banks, which are very affected by the crisis, are riddled with their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than $30 billion) corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The CNBC American television channel reported in a report that Citigroup was also planning to reimburse the aid received.
The banking institutions thus seek to remove the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses assigned to the executives and the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America has launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors that reported $19 billion in fresh money to the Bank of America.
The rest of the money comes from the bank funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Kenneth Lewis, the Bank of America's Director-General, said on Wednesday evening that he had a specific duty to thank American taxpayers: capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying Merrill Lynch's investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to purchase money in financial markets in order to get rid of the state's guardianship.
As of Thursday, the U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase, reporting the CNBC chain citing the banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the limo of the current position of editor Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the big favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there has also been a desire not to harm ZDF's leader Markus Schächter more in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract be extended for five years, but that had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The dismissal by vote of Brender was a failure to do so, although it was predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already been able to hear several weeks before the vote, and did not wish to take Brender back to his post.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused that the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief would be extended by invoking the fact that the listening rate of the ZDF information emissions had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, stifling the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had become involved in the debate and who felt that the way Koch acted was unconstitutional.
But it won't have served anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhône-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first in the news magazine "Hute-journal" (present day).
From 1988 to 1990, he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then he corresponded to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was the director and presenter of the "Morgengamazins" (bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial.
After Brender's misfortune, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the proposals of the manager's staff cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not plan to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF Supervisory Boards.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skillfully maneuvered to the Board of Directors by vehemently criticising the commission in his decision to remove Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter at the position.
In the arithmetical representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal of the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to become more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Directors, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be closed down.
In addition, the workload should be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At regional level, there should be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and university rectors have constantly put the phrase "studiability" into their mouths.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of selected examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", read out in a 30-page document on future admission conditions for university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council, states that by clearly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the derapages, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
The "studiability" should also be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
Modules as well as background should be carefully examined to see if one cannot avoid this suffocating feeling that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to RAID's latest knowledge of Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and discretion to allow and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that only in 2015 all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the Accreditation Councils created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the system of examinations was not too strict.
In some Länder, specialized universities and higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorials and strengthen educational guidance offices and examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wishes to table to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete its studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, and recognition of notes from other higher education institutions should be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of the conditions for study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students indicated that he would like to see the organization of educational policy move away from "the back doors" of Ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as interested persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He calls for the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduated to register for a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide today's Bachelor's students with sufficient places to study in Master's degree and study conditions as well as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more class managers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is through these words " Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he spats in bits of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently a collection manager in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literal circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, the theme of which was "German literature in Romania in mirror and mirror distorting your cases Security".
Clearly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Security.
Söllner received in 1989 the German language award jointly with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been sufficiently able to resist the intimidation tests of Security."
Poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary malices with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own case Security, IM Walter played a role, assures the specialist of the Michael Markel literature after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He was able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of Security had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and have sometimes guessed which real names were ultimately hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
Unlike Germany where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been continuously counterbalanced and slowed down in the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has been rather delayed.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Temesvar Security who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very devastation towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamity of power was thought to be able to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many of the ineluctable issues are associated with the Söllner case as it occurs so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been despoiled? The weighted response of the listeners, with Söllner's consent, leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, pulled with four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportsman had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose lean skull drew attention, let himself be led into the city which was still alien to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't either drunk with happiness.
He had had a nice evening but had to return to work tomorrow.
Because now it's about to start.
The words of Switzerland that had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "big work" awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three shipping goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be released on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderated only in the one who had been lucky, who had transmitted destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a faultless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plombing of souls" – Gross - the recipe of success that sounded so well that it no longer had effects with the healer Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan -, "in football when there is a new impulse it sometimes happens things that would never have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the best player's rank thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "It is someone who moves on and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't gone over yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart is mostly in need of tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved well one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday did not have the heart to party, even after the first home win for three months, was due to the weekend events that a television interview of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and do not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also regarded him as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the matches was removed from him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" led to Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life with these two quadrogens.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, that is to say that without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, the strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in success" turned Heldt and Lehmann into a choir – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesça.
World heavy goods vehicles championship
Warm battle in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly and verbally and manageably provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his world champion title from heavyweights according to the version of the WBC federation.
On the unanimity of the judges, he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his world champion of heavyweights.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion won a victory at the unanimous points of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been defending his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he didn't make the KO long-awaited.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional combats, has twice confessed to his defeat for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In Bern's Arène, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, by its left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller that, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus impeding Klitschko to bring into play his harmful right-wing opponent.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only very rarely hit the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, has exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko to treat him as a "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weight Friday, the champion was unable to stop to provoke Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-established in his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot at this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
Its challenge is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotional company is planning to play this game now at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack on the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
SPD and La Gauche parties (die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "contradicted" on the murderous impact of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the broadcast of information of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The killing order was given to total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new news reports from the media, the target of the Strip was in fact not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the US air strike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to take a decision in front of the federal parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Greens' party Renate Künast believe that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the chancellery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government Spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices to express doubts about the true reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the presence of both senior officials, however, it is suggested that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have in the meantime asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received a reply
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was to be constituted on the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not that the limits between imagination and reality are confused among the mentally ill, or under the influence of the drug.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can give ourselves without hindrance to the most crazy dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who wakes up makes the dream experience, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has quickly the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychiatric patients or under the influence of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes instigates the limits between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, of neurotransmitters of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and aketylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes the character of a comic strip.
Its body is in two dimensions with the colours created.
Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it's gliding across the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him creatures of ailed devil, staggering, bleeding mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Tonitruant, wicked, screaming voices coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer support those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo chain, actually a loop and ties it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a buffalo and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop breaks apart.
That it serves you as a lesson, yelling at the voice in a choir to take away his tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniac-depressant, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned how to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under sensations.
Like dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and ghosts from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatric department of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the heart of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why the schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in your life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved."
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why is our brain doing this kind of cabrioles, it's always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, Fuchs says.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved present infamous brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal brain maturation is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and also increases the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a trigger for psychosis, if there is predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What is crazy, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of while others buy expensive drugs to get rid of them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are well part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are psychiatric disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain warms but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledge having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A girl to do everything normal to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, long-haired chestnut, gives him the word.
When she answers her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this nice young lady.
I'm crazy, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows very well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, apparitions are usually frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations on the table.
At night, apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that happens too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreamt already, if the images she sees, the faces shivering or the girl with bloody carvings on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her dick last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact on the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has insufficient stimulation, the probability is that he has hallucinations after some time.
I'm guessing the brain isn't busy enough, makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., a unique girl, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of the age of thinking, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience," according to Kasten "is happening in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally sound person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, we have a tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but it also contains something positive, of creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of the modification of the consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroids are very complex semi-revenues that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot distinguish from dream even when he is awake.
Onioid consciousness manifests during trauma or in extreme conditions as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, through his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity of organization that is given to us, to us men, not to darken in the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious party for a trip several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he created of all rooms, visits foreign places, travels in time. He looks in old man allied in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his hair guarding his health.
He lives at the middle age among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is abducted by a motorcycle Greek who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen these inner journeys are fundamentally distinguished from any dream.
The dream is a quite different state, he writes by describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even on the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burde
At 27 years of age, children will follow up the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to return to the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly committed to integrating society, said Hubert Burda, 69, to Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with them.
It would kill the children as well as the company.
Burda reported last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he was in charge of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17, respectively, her son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have been allowed to train by a bully of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself as the country's preceptor as Springer, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the goal that El Corte Inglés has set itself, which has just opened up in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary area of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feed radius, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation zone in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, there are 250 m2 in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all begins with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us then how to properly perform our exercise program.
His director assures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included), suffice to get all the muscles of the body to work.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we propose rituals of repair of hair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10h to 22h.
Miscellaneous take-offs
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must consider.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equips the electric car
The Endesa electrical company, in collaboration with the City of Barcelona, created the "Office LIVE".
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will implement mobility agreements, by carrying out procedures, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will involve itself in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVEL Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is taking to promote the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero talks "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, spoke of "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, was the main export sector in the country.
During the presentation of the 2009 President of the Government's Economic Report, Zapatero recalled the steps taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Motor Vehicle Sector Plan (IPA), allocated €800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was aimed at developing new models as well as modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "high increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the Salon internationaldes autos de collection, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilion de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and car collection, but we will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds linked to the world of the engine.
For example, in the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles linked to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in the sale of cars, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Puache, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Classicas, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sporting exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with automobiles and collection bikes will also take place on a circuit designed outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just incorporated in the Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system, named i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that as well as the Mazda3 that Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Gulf, that they all want to surpass.
By continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this is a large box with regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the petrol engine of two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the equipment level, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is, the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive internal mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment were not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1 500 euros, includes, among other elements, two-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It particularly illustrates the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and their high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this important amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury « First »
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever sparkled us, dressed in as elegant as sexy models for Nine's release. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility only to see certain types of attachments or to navigate over the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The monthly price of its subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up the data when crossing a border or looking desperately for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult their mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and it's been working for a long time.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
Repeated reminders from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside its home country, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of pricing, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals allowing them to profitability their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no fees.
It is a connected device and is paid during its purchase and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life as Peek already proposes in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, undoubtedly the most important of her life: the award to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama had a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pull to the green with brilliant reflections, both times, the outfit was composed of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabrics, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So that from a first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States follows the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put back the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the taking of function, on the other hand, it was wearing a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heeled green shoes for the first time, and a similar but golden model, this time.
The hair also changed: the hair is now raised while wearing them dropped the previous time.
75 per cent of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fecondity and professional career of women in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of the working mothers have seen their careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of married life and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activities outside the home, work part-time or work poorly, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, are re-emerging into married life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having settled in pairs. This figure goes to 4.1 for those working in the public sector."These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely affects maternity, but less the common starting date," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who underwent elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another discontinuity also occurs among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary studies get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle- and higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to achieving stable work as a precondition for a child's marriage and arrival," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several brand products, setting the universal motto "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, comes to join other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its largest representatives, creators and models, of yesterday and today, met for the annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographic summary, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not save the spatters or the enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same one that I felt without naming it: the pleasure against the funist destiny, the guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nyhilist, a Christian allegorical, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic humour dazzling, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasts thirteen years, in the flesh from which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the way of perdition."
On James Joyce: "Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand meters of the universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best mountaineers still leave and always take."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of greatness."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he made it in the escape of himself and invoking the hindrance with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: "God-loved, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired the death of retaliation."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her between the trenches or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen such a patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if he didn't try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if they don't shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did it do if it is not to aspirate this man's glory for him to serve as a pedestal?"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of Fuenlabrada city, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a male blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying so, they gave her two blows of feet that left the dog severely wounded.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what fun is there to attack a defenceless little animal free of charge, which, moreover, was left behind.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she was insulting these individuals, was afraid for her physical integrity, since an energuine who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person who is weaker than him.
The episode took place at about 17 hours, on Tuesdays like another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the local police even though we doubt that this is a great deal of use and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the coward killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so that they find it fun to mistreat a defenceless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the good education and respect of animals and people has passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with her commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products", and stated that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Gavanva, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nodded, since the reference to the comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles have been added (based on passenger cars, pick-up cars, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not yet dissipated, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank credits, other factors such as increasing unemployment or continuing poor economic conditions must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been scarce.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of Co2 that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we reiterated the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The concessionaires' association foresees a year 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourist vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear impact.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's footing.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in reverse, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four injuries with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figuerulas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, in GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, takes on importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to reduce it to less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a hand-held roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 extra kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of earned, to mount sports tanks, another 12 kilos, and with 19-inch light tyres, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on California's secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
Its behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: for a long time we had not tested such a small and light model that at the same time guarantees so much safety in turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles at a low speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push back his engine...
It is out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or with a system that alters the roughness of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at stopping or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The surface of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely acted on the entire route, while on some turns we found verglas in the early morning and gravels later in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light, funnier car to drive, which is much more than just an amendment of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
“ Bag Girl ”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional star of the house parades, the singer displays her face as bad girl with as containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences of Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus in the lead of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show which, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov through a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, made it seem as if they had jumped to the Israeli field with the hot wrists.
Français and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the inner game of Barak and the work of Eliyahu, who was received by acclamations and applause back to his old house, to increase their advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 scored points, although Splitter's "less six" evaluation was already presuming that tonight was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing had been played, far from that, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that they didn't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias's hand," they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making yellows take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being killed, needed to chain up some skillful actions to take the air, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun came up which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas returned the meter to a reassuring score (54-67), and which the premises succeeded in increasing at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play the whole thing during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best in their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend themselves well, and although the Israelis came closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from battling
Unicaja lost a lot of money in Greece in front of Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euro League, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter-time, made it possible to dream the Andalusian. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the meneur Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who gleaned the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the strength of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overthrow the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of fighting, between the North American Menors Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing their superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, showed himself superior and even came to equalize the difference of the encounter disputed in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chanced.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos looked relentless when the players put pressure on and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to climb the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the search engine having the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicle ads in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since the application has been working for a week, the search engine has found that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels badly paid," explained Albert Ribera, in a press release responsible for Trovit's products.
According to Trovità's data from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives EUR 45 226 per annum and one French, 31 059, while one Spanish receives EUR 24 000.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euro gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid work in Spain is that of server, with 11 592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, mid-term jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office will be required to drop the diplomatic legion by 27 January 2010 at the latest, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since September 21, before that date.
"He realizes that he must leave on 27 January, after his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The channel also cited the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured himself that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at zero rates, so that financial institutions can purchase assets to be mobilized.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without challenging their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the bearings, as the ECB has done, with their adjudication to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reverse in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far away from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further downgrading of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were again trying to cause a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had hindered the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is decree a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to give its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro area not to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, on the other hand, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt deficits increase in line with the obligations of European enterprises, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's differences decreased and our differences continued to increase, then it would be an idiosyncrasic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote.When our forecast indicators obligate most study services to anticipate their models of revival and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not offer much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the time being "prudence is a mother of survival".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the Congress of Deputies subcommittee, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, at eight-clos.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion up to 2020 and an additional EUR 60 billion between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes, and power will have to be increased.
Its betting focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with mechanisms to recover carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW more are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his business demands, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "point" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although in the long term, should begin to be taken, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus's handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, will play the privileged partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of collaboration to create the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million up to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actia disputes its first highway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Actia is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site is an estimated tunnel of US$ 1.7 billion (about EUR 1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works company and concessionaire of highways.
The city council wishes to be able to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment will amount to US$ 1,700 million (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase will face three consortiums, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in plain, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European experts in underground work.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (affiliate of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large yards and privatisations, but entering it is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just taken a place in this market because of its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
The action is based on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the grouping of companies to build and manage Adelaide's desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (northern link), is called to link the western Toowong motorway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule established by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll route will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the yard will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief largely fruitful, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company transferred the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane City. The works have not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC will be awarded a 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, is assisted by the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after seeing the work of expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its realization will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is in favour of Renfe advertising.
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of these next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that have submitted to the call for tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprise, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore re-decided.
An application shop
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed the wake of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from the transmission of votes.
Initially, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to happen in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth positions of clubs that have spent the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to reach the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, had won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former Europe Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, the two teams who, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, though they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more securities than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (the Madrid Athletics) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths of the final receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and not more than 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça seized 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which $337.8 million is allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion used 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 % of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public acquisition offer (PAO) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos's shares ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV assured not to have been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this were to happen, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and from the judicial and come from his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as the director of internal audit.
A decision made by the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sos reveals further diversions of funds over the next few months cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the JCC and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Invertera Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9th.
The monitoring agency explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted as "sufficient" following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao scholarships.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, and that they could in no way be transferred before the finalization of the offer, which he indicated was the price fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car goes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, as each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price recorded.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model is created, on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a model sold massively, work can be ready within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information on Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To perform the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests every year 90 million to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of cashier parts or for the calculation of the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it at most 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaViN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional Internet sector that allows you to rent on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a failure or how many have suffered serious injuries for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for assessing claims, failures or car maintenance.
The evaluation GT guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per annum over the past three years, and it has made a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is realized in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed as a $1,000 million grant, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the side of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet Auctions of Accidental Cars
In October last year, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This estimate and sales service is intended exclusively for industry professionals such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and operates over 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 operations in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with the Spanish law, a car whose number of chassis has been withdrawn can no longer circulate, but, on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage currency
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user obtains a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 all-terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary piece is selected.
The user may include variables such as labour price, increases or reductions, and then print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
At present, Audatex works to make these images in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that the mechanics see from a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
