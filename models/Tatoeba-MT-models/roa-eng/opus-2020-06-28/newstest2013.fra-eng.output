A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took the form of a further 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states after the November 2010 elections.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to vote as an elector on election day and withdraw citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The republican authorities have endeavoured to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required ID card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with photo.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic voting.
It appears, however, that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns helped to record about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the enrolment rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the early-voting voters were Afro-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state voters.
He was going the same way with the Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens voted in advance.
In return, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the early voters.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The US Advocate General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They have been able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted upon and see a clear objective of influencing results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes produce incorrect results, with false negative results or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Do you pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and have strong recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that there is between 30 and 40% more chance of metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers that are indolent.
The patient must really be made to understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer, offering him or her the options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for determining who should or should not be dealt with are being determined accurately.
I therefore recommend that the test be carried out.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the for and against the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of them.
It is estimated that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a lot of damage to people's health.
"Today again, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", laments the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging donation: 10 years after the cessation of smoking, the risk of dying from a half-dwelling cancer.
Weight
Embodiement and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," we add.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Crackery, too, and it should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salariing may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," we say.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Spend a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs Boson Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing like that.
And then it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is good for the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let us suppose, however, that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being deceived seem thin, and let us see what this is all about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally indisputable law wanting that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting largely of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In a corner there are good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other there are bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then divide themselves into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, indeed) The Part Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particules of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all beasts as exotic as we might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "distorts" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, somewhat like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbing" there is an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or of ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, to the difference that it's another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27km ring of circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like photon, yours) don't have one.
Now, what can "bring" all these researches, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
In fact, there are several who have a strong desire to find it, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, proposing no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found at CERN until now.
Impact
The impact of this research on the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
Keep in mind: at the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were talking about scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a small light sensor during his optical work in 1969.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and has earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that we really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill prepares itself.
However, in this key area, much remains to be done.
The duty tried to look closer to it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that grunted him had left him with a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-dreamed, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Fastened in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even comes to smile, speaks to the strangers who work around him, bring him his drugs, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I be healed from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man, he pisses himself," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's house.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept the regression," he says.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and stifled " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask for her to help her breathe.
However, in the next few days, she awaits a final visit of her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, we provide body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, given when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
By dying, we will agree to give mouth care to brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois' house, the days follow but don't look like each other.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-done in his pillows while he is in his honour, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to ease suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Grand Montréal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that causes several physicians specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by summits of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists hang on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helen Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she abandoned a proven chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she regretted I was stopping fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick people who are asking to die thank the caregivers for not accessing their application after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep the patient until the time of death, sporadic or permanent.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unsatisfied patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, BTP entrepreneurs, political party funders and Italian mafia specialists report day after day what they know from a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, public servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafios.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has been eroded since the great resources were taken," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was for him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive inquiry into the misappropriation of road work contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only to retreat.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and civil servants corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, the only ministry of transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some referring their instincts to reach a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "removing the strata behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also joins its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers of the "Marteau Squadron" who, since 2009, would have led the Montreal "Sewage Map" to put the gentle pedal on the inflated contracts...
In recent weeks, she conducted a series of searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly used bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally charged with engineers at the Montreal Highway and with entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accorso and Lino Zambita.
The latter made sense by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-related intermediary that paid the money back to Union Montréal, the mayor's party Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambit sowed at all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fundraiser for former Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost-inflated sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked in a round manner.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, described him well before the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and wine potters totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that he inflated the costs.
Other road officials have confessed to fattening the leg by inflating the bills from 30% to 40% by extra fakes.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, diving into a major crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first electors to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, it rises from 2010 against the sale of a municipal plot purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "throws on a wire to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the faults."
The process, she said, is "hard but positive."
We're cleaning up the wound, but we're going to need a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a day before, so we don't see any more dubious practices coming back.
Just like we clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, for his part, that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "eluts in the stratagem", when they did not stumble in the wizard!
Deeming 70% of the share of dirty money in the funding of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he irons out: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, but this will not change, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go lower; we can go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr.Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look into their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I progress with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preformation center at my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by bearings.
So you take advantage of the competition created by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makele, who was in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today he does not have the same in League 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and won many titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
Then I got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at the first season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we're stuck.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first off our chicken, in front of Porto, in order to be able to receive on the 8th of the final coming back.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register over time.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to be realized.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really at the heart of this champion's title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the guns to take it away.
Do you expect the media to wait too long for the PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot of us in view of what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame, it's definitely a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the League of Champions that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been there for two seasons to qualify for the 8th final, they've also made huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, we could imagine you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally carried it away.
The PSG appears to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better it's said, there's a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and that he puts a lot of goals.
He came for it and proves he's the star of League 1.
He demonstrated wherever it happened that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things there, and I got stronger.
Today, I get to make good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and today we have to have an exemplary attitude.
What are you looking at the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the World Qualifying Group.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good nul (1-1) torn off on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs among stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, which is a banking monopoly, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the form of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credit", used to advance in a video game you win by playing or you can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist well in the public book of accounts, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, like a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a phase of file hacking, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "take" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (beaucoup of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also evident at each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (true currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They simply have an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are available.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he said.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and Afghans to choose their future without waiting for us.
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, such as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was made in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban derailment in Kabul as of the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants who are outdated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan and current Taliban governments join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into business, seizing government lands to resell them on land to build refugees income from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
Most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have known how to take advantage of the American vastness: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fans of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who are going to order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and well before.
No industry has been rebooted, no dam is in repair, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This added only to the feeling that the West were only there to make up for it.
Without the energy to treat iron or copper or iron or copper in place, or the means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day, it will also take Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, to re-establish normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school of girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gain the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, led, and led to the completion by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local labor, have been able to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small farms from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to rid themselves of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, what farmers have told me to want, small civilian assistance should be maintained, well-controlled and directly affecting them.
A Constitution with the Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker kick from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its full role.
On short notice, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House two more months to finish its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended what undermines institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic deliriousness", continuing to "treason his word" and to "beat the law."
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a way to bring an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time forcing the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
As long as this recourse to a precipitated vote takes place from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Be you voting for my text, or I keep full powers", they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had locked the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Human rights, religious minorities and civil society representatives had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added to the haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Without any surprise, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Commentators also enjoyed the fact that only one of the differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the grantor was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all attention, article 2 remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," reply the Liberals, who see only one communication strike.
For in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premies of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also aroused by the fact that the next head of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes "that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed borrow from religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could in the future arise to what extent civilian judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of its extended powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious issue: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the Defence Budget will not be examined in Parliament, but in a National Defence Council.
No longer will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as demanded by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly the press.
Furthermore, no articles no longer echo the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch points out.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Centre of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has taken five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go and love the holy places
Make yourselves indispensable: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal funds" will be touched by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
The believers walk through the Rue de la Souffrance or the way to the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoire), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the Onection and the setting to the tomb.
This is the Christian center of the world, a symbol of humanity's salvation.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree was grown used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave them small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former enemy shelter built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can go there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m altitude, there is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes make a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses close to 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Museum of Art of Tel-Aviv.
The main paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are shown there.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths consisting of molds of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique Private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of Holocaust or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel-Aviv, which comes back on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter into a total darkness.
Sparkling stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim all year round.
By the way, it is the world's most unique sea: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The water of azure color contains brine and very easily retains the bathers, even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are surreal beauty.
It is there to perform a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also simply to relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here himself a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross between young married people who have come to take pictures of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk in Roman theatre, "to conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Notes to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey through all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the week of work begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only homemade food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk but also the hops, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, dried peas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-nourished cats that walk altain air.
We can see them in the evening sleeping on the roofs of the cars parked.
They love places that pass by and don't refuse to be given.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of the Figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists travelled to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who tongue has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters are selling "false" certificates already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule concerns only those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sector.
However, over time, the federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the language must be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries in which Russian has official language status are exempt.
People who obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Russian-speaking Institute of Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, they respond to the representatives of the migration service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certified, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In them, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passport, and they do not touch the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to make money in Russia trust that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow only a decent primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people start earning money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust me.
"You feel diminished and softened."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no review or formal work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defending to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you can get a fake record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have records, and that is why we have extortion cases.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea," Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Be quick, don't lick and buy yourself a beautiful work of art."
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that registration papers for migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by federal migration service employees.
Forged papers come out of an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the examination task had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper bits".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination for the first time in order to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very small.
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the carriers of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it was shooting at marriages or the murder organized by the lawyer, Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and to raise the legal age of obtaining the permit to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Douma shortly.
Everyone is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "knocking the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, declared to Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a legal and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing to the black market.
According to them, we can find in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and at the Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site that takes orders from weapons
The first is "military trace," that is, weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market is those stolen by criminals to law enforcement.
Baranets explained that these were both stolen weapons in police stockpiles and those that were directly removed from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols leave for sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been exploded.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires have been designed to conceal the deficit," the former military explained.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and flow arms into the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes craftsmanship, a mafia formed and organized the supply," the former military added.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons in the black market have been found "because of the employees whose work is arms-related", the report states.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "illegal searches".
A seller and consultant of an armory who has asked to keep anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
We deliver her to her by going through the grove.
"He transports it in town and sells it for $900 per unit with two shippers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all matters, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, they carry out a check on illegal arms merchants," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I have consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya Station where someone would take me to a "coin" to market.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explain the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there it is also necessary to come there by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American punches with the help of a person I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Little new ones look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets attempted to purchase illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
According to him, the patterns have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, says Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the vendor in the forest and install a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start to negotiate," the expert describes.
A shop from her sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"Just have a precise amount of money," they write in advertising on the site "Buying a Gun or a Gun of Combat".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"No permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).

I have heard about this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying on the site, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.

A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, may cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was removed from long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall decreased by 7% in Russia and stood at 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast Food and Supermarket Employees Strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to take a long time, or it's going to blow up quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
At the same time as the modest increase in salaries for basic employees in Walmart and in the fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Vendredi", at a time when a defrosting rain of balances seized millions of inhabitants shot down on America and sometimes sparking slammers.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their posts to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to shotguns by passing through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
There is an average of 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart only run their races at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting trolleys or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, they complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For Walmart's basic employee who is $9.5 an hour, it's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all wage increases to the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would bring them back to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in one year than now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the shops at 8:00 p.m. the next day, and Walmart sold 5,000 items on the second.
Its caisses made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Vendredi".
The spokesman for Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-hand Huffington Post that in any "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "coming operation among many others" from the organizing union.
Next client!
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, that is why they are not yet implanted) but McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases over time, but little, on average, its base employees reach New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than they do in this city.
For me, it is inconceivable to live with this amount in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing employees of McDonald's who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near the 40th Street McDonald's and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, an increase of more than twice as the current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing the administration and punishing protestors of a union by means of bullies or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking care of the rapid restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main factors is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast food chains.
The light moment of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near the McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local democrat policies, notably that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you have done honestly!".
Protesters have been supported by other New Yorkers in view, notably by the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we all have to support the workers of the rapid restoration so that they get a just salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated there, not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to tell whether this mass-movement spark will make small.
"For the time being, we only manage to cheat on the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the reality increased through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference, and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the 3D interactive technology group of the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already old history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, through the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We're working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we're trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being in pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch screen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the action order.
- What does the future mean for us?
- Although Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, is not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on 3D imaging systems that operate on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, in the physical world, to make it more touchy.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because it does not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to order the aircraft in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-carved bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that right?
- For example, how would you ask me to get through this can?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
For example, it can be laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth, and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we rely on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be nice to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In relation to this last point, all the current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
The resolution should be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, gave the touch of sensors a regular delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need such a device in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one is a reflector receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or boost it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As much as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transition" that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to your smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (personal elements are the ones you're the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality raised from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is a problem on which opponents to this idea point the finger: there is no touch sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What responses does your group prepare against this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of touch sensations.
For the time being, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air breath on the ends of the fingers.
There are also wrist straps that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a focus of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make believe to someone who is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of running rugs (not to mention those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, it is only medium to deceive the brain, and there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Le avant-garde petersbourgeoise" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already received prominent actors from the artistic scene of Saint Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed red that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or at the related parties and blinds.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the widely social and philosophical Petrsbourgeois storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the early Petersburg period of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a seamstress specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in society, all that is not gray arouses aggression and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to begin the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work was.
I realized it was my way.
So the wave of old unofficial painters had passed away and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to bond with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the centre of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took a place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in wet jerseys, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, a composer today in fashion.
When the group began to occur live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was a great host of shows before Hali Gali's era.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career started, but his training and basic education, it's where he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the implications of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, from the time culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Think of the Year," and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a socialist, today it hurts and it's afraid to be like this.
But with clowns, everything goes away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we take an interest in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but we have to spit on him instead.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
We've seen you in the role of the organ player in Barbaria recently, a cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful as well?
- Today the commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think of who you're going to please.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people who have been thrown out to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and at the end of the day, it's less management, more money, more waste.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin the life.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are those that you paint at the end of your life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of culture yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that the good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are dismissed, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and will pave the way for them.
Currently, it is the "king of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves from other museums.
- What's Saint Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for that.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions and concerts.
In us, this layer is very thin.
We have to make art in fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Fellowship
Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a murderous asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with earthenmen aboard go to search for a planet of relief.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to make our species live as a pestilence or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, if only on a case-by-case basis.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the Venus surface is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the Venus orbit... in space.
We started to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
There is still a half century, there were experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from the terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects have been blinded, small reproductive drosophile flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how an embryo was developing in weight.
We get a very normal chick out there.
Then the problems start.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were treated disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We have strangled their eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with chicks in space.
The last organic miniature ark with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion " will take on only species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellite and then it's the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are still not being performed directly in space.
It's not a damn deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our muzzle flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," says Vakhtang Vachnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who have had anything and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriya Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonauts Preparation Centre: mandatory phase of the preparation on the fly.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train on extra-vehicular outputs.
The water imitates the appeaser.
If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
It's logical in principle, because from birth to first bath, it only takes two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the person is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
In weight, the muscles of the belly, the basin atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on delivery simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to think about this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If he does not feel the earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress up an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a fully disadapted disabled child," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Terriens will go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Financial Control Institution) said: "The control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation, but it is at the helm of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint audit conducted by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar findings.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls, so is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect the enforcement of the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage specific public procurement and national legislation, as well as its own practice.
We have gathered all this and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "serious and of better quality", however, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it do for you?
Joint monitoring of this kind should contribute precisely to stopping us from trying to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is at such a point submerged by the paperwork, that those looking for the faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way, also has a council which is a little different, but these two institutions are basically proceeding in a similar way.
Competences are also, to some extent, similar, however, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are there controlled at the level of the Länder accounts.
Is national legislation simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, is also facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any benefit in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to you as an institution?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori check, we have to have a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new "risk detection tool for bad management" with which we have gone to the screen close to 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be rather an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the law on markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequence of the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to that?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act like nothing was.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are by frozen places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible in some areas with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillated between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should rise slightly in the day.
The snowfalls have ceased in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
The ridges of the metal hills (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service show that due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 and the national roads of the region are now workable without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be put on, for example, certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It remains on some of their sections of frozen snow remnants and traffic jams.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that certain Eastern Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of verglas and that snow layers crammed by traffic can be found on roads in mountainous areas and located at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of verglae formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow clogged with traffic is present on the roads in the areas at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and +1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions in places.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range from -3 ° to -9 ° C.
After the last snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some channels of communication may be by frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what the regional road maintenance service reports.
The D5 motorway is almost without difficulty, however, the road communication maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between km 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in Pilsen-South district and Tachov district.
Departmental and third-class roads are wet, and in this case, caution is applied against frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the areas of the Olomouc region at altitude must now have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the neck said "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
This night, snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of Šumperk district are snowy remains.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet a thick and soft snow layer at the "Červenohorské sedlo" neck "today, the head of road maintenance services in Šumperk district said to ČTK.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also went to the site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, roads can be used without difficulty, however, in the Šternberk district drivers should be careful in sections in forest areas with wet floors.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the North Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to the police, in addition to some snow or verglas-covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, and so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the central Plateau of Bohema, there is no problem, on the contrary, and roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow fountain during the day, clear sky and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec since the main roads.
The closure of the circulation between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of snow until reaching the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It is only one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love to fall.
In our Tap Tap group, it's rather funny and it's said that we're the only group able to collect a lot of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this project to our readers in more detail?
It is a charity that we have been preparing for two years already.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time of the end of the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour advance time zone in front of us.
Who got that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world called "End of the cancelled world " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it during these charitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point in a unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech biz show, because we organize many concerts and charities...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It has proved that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is amusing them.
What will the benefits of these concerts serve against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose we are working on the realization in the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of Jedličkąv Institute and offer activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands of music and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustutosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other " mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring, and we will also be able to prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on-site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is however a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it first thing.
We have five members in electric wheelchair whose gears must travel in suspense, of course we also roam a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has happened more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that at the same time everyone is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common that a person travels alone in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet see it as obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association that strives to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements continue to depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láğa Angelovič says, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's subsidies, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is of course pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of sure.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people arrive at us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láğa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, there's nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or want to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012, starting at 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the cancelled world" will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre located in Prague at Jedlička Institute.
The price for a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket notice is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a 20th member of this agency, the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed it has participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's road to outer space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled " Introduction to Astronautics ".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a spreader of world-renowned astronauts, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925 a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocketed engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the drain.
The only known information on this drain is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the records that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both of these projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were conducted by the interim scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish astronomical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a company in the November 1954 issue of the issue of the issue, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to Astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was of the future.
In early 1956, the Polish astronomical society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international astronomical federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the Meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1,800-metre rocket was 80 cm long and weighed slightly less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have ranged up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR national committee two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Goods Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on works of public utility.
This decision raised a serious debate in the public eye.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the different economic entities as well as national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital allied to frantic financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (wages) generate price tension.
The following meaning should be put to rest on this point: a producer seeks to import goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying at low prices, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social and thereby social responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State are necessarily increasing.
All of this reinforces the perfect bad will of gentlemen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race to the profit.
This situation is at such a point of public notoriety that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital regardless of social collapse.
This is manifested mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to force economically its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
On the one hand, there is a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other, the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of such people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such wages as the State is forced to pay an additional fee to achieve the minimum vital.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their countries.
The following question needs to be asked: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theory and the media say, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly advocates the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then must be whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
Evidence is that there is a lobby that is virtually all-powerful and present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In FRF, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the development of draft laws to firms of lawyers closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, as the Western constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompee": "The state has long been in delicacy and functions were attributed by violence.
The beatings of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The underworld and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to elections with voices already sold"... "honest people did not seek to obtain office, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consul."... 'We were really beginning to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was a self-cracy and that we had to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompée, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
This is the result, as in the past, of a decadence without prior to the elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today's elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Goods Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able," Sting says in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refractory is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the part of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, have been born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view of the "back of the curtain" on the one to which they mainly benefit from tensions that have persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the story of a struggle for power.
Every time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who led their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical richness is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the poor (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s, they acquired the first global press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or leading wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew his central bank status to the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue his own (government, I hear) money during the civil war and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the EDF for triggering the major economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the 1859s to 1871s to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree Freemason, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order according to chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent crises such as those they caused in 1907 being repeated).
After having managed to unleash the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to Habsburg in the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by a German capitulation without economic and military justification (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the slaughter of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start to the Second World War, bankers have allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany pharaoh war reparations, thus generating the conditions for radicalisation of the impoverished masses (then sufficient to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which it actually has) of a fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a massive Jewish emigration to Palestine and the first friction with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held it; or if everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could lead to a Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide hard between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong leads to another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power throughout the world are at the root of everything?
Here we need to make a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, international bankers are proposing only their own candidates to the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascising politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to start a war with Iran, who could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Ormuz Strait through which it transits 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a completely controlled being.
"May they compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and enslaved to wear a red iron mark on their hands or forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell the one who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has good sense counts the figures of this fierce beast.
This number means man and it's six hundred sixty six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters from Islamist students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had been supporting his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome; it could not, indeed, abandon Shah, because it would have severely shaken the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, again aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The diplomats kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate arouses a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated peripeties, they found themselves in the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a roambolosque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team came to make searches for the shooting of a large-scale science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialist shops reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful, treachery - like, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's raise, twelve and thirteen.
Ambiances follow: sequences of Theheran of documentary style (in the sub-titled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retransscribed in the film, there are no major differences),
"Hollywood's lighter passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with custom men discussing the situation around conference tables, in corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his play ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark police " Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also the first film of Affleck that does not take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the features that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "obtained" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive because of its clarity that also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many actions at too many locations
The director had to be content with a subject offering only a few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He does well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is pushed away by a phone blow in America and the pursuit on the landing runway are quite pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be with a moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the business.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a quota of 40 per cent women for the management of the major European companies has been the cause of our decision," said the newspaper Pravo, the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women were at an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations, for example, there is an obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the poultry cage size directive, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "beurre à tartiner" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas shall be 14 cm in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto rights).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, due to the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives entail waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to the EU regulation last year, which must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey that balloons are the first cause of death by suffocation among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age with respect to blowing in fair trumpets.
We have strange ideas too.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macédoine" and must instead speak of FYROM (Form Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" consisting of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some of the above mentioned absurdities, the Union Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked, as a result, a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to municipalities by the Department of Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and in practice they had to be used to draw up grants from Brussels.
The EU states: "Birth regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the efficiency of the functioning of the Union and in the area of its general development deserve commendation.
More serious, for example, experts say, is the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has a duty to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the struggle which it does not always win) gives rise to intense emotions among the Czechs.
At the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvarůžky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane, not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's massapain or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň's Carp ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and Žatec's hop ("Žatecký chmel").
The Spice Bread of Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we plan to stand for the presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that the thieves are not under locks and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to find a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, member of no party, I have no alternative to influence the situation than to stand for presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Château (N.d.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I was elected a senator, I would introduce myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the greatest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we laugh at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we trample all those who try to bring change.
This is in addition to the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I bribed journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's advisor.
Let us come to your visions.
You started the battle for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law to that end.
As President, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have much more chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or of the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left- or right-wing, but that people are gathered.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I also act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get close.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world and experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will be able, for example, to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then explain why they don't want to.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, it was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without ambages, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm just trying to get things moving, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to come to the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did mostly gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People elected a Senate that could hardly impose changes.
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you planning on founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
Neither do I have money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking tax returns, what's yours?
I'm looking forward to about 60 million worth of my personal property.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
Either said by the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was gallant with women and was fighting against evil and abuse.
You're running in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I will not stand for election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities on the line?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the direction of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I won and continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it makes it very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a walk on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a big business nearby, tells us, "Yes, it's actually beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one likes to go to one of those crowded libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing appealing at Rotterdam's gates, holds a rather special record.
The commune of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty little miniature reinforced concrete painted.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to get our hands on statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, of the architect office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of diagrams in bold sticks and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepts the project with its usual phlegm and presented himself in the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a embroidering on the face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, disconcerted and harassing the shoulders, Maas, the confrontational, stacked his choice books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common love!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has dirt.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and semi-detached houses for a total of 50 houses.
Early in November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is thus that this small terne village, which until today had nothing more to offer that a pedestrian postmodern area and a town hall of a horrific laideur, whose white facades invite them to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under a cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you climb the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the floor in Dutch bricks and the elegant reverberas speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for the public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere there are books, books, and books.
"Normally, the library beams are located along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been well designed: in the middle there are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical plant of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are at times of the lamps, sometimes of the balustrades, sometimes of the staircase ramps.
A new experience for the sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a cold farm an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimetre of thickness as a substrate in greenhouses and fields has been used for years.
It's cheap and time-consuming.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pudding ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is adjusted by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates little time inside, even the days of fine weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds are charged with the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, described even the Boekenberg as the "finally found soul" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has allowed to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully guarded (today, it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
Thus, MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain during the vote on the establishment of an area of air exclusion.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still stunning to find this role, but they are on the path of a "more normal" foreign policy.
External policy, such as in France or Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention in the vote of the United Nations?
First, Germany has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not give too much importance to this because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is, in any case, a key element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany have a negative impact on its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced their veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overcrowding with Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be included in a broader policy line and must assert their unique position.
That is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future take on a role as a locomotive and push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
In my view, however, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to assume leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulties playing a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with neighbours and very varied opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only diminishes, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this gap, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant for them and if they're only less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name lies a trademark officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such as the company that bears the name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause for it.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes on my desk.
Impersons need only a few extra letters to register their marks.
For example, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copying themselves, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a binder in which the recordings made at the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriateing part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In the big cities there are shopping centers on several floors that sell only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his bosses are responsible for attacking the fact that the Chinese trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are appointed to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in relation to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third largest and fastest growing world luxury product market.
However, it is not easy to remove the dubious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last for up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported on the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the critical name had become a "reality of the market".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism because he would have damaged his mark in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to Hong Kong and Singapore's plagiars who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits, however, that it had some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have spent the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of work at a found normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 proceedings are still pending before the Office.
Disappear to Right/ Bottom
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost one-third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and that means that China is for the tenth consecutive time leading the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Certainly, the Germans were able to obtain the suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the immitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munichois' objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case from the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Surveillance is on the move.
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and vanquishes the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, hard and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute in vain.
"That's what we see for ourselves," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if copycats from this region were to operate unprotected trademarks.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is in place".
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
In their view, it is not enough to rely on international trade marks law that foreigners should instead "register in China as well all that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their coming.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, snails for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers are slowly amplifying - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they are taking off, enveloping and following.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor loses almost his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, the chorale Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came from the genetician in human medicine to the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Being helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child the money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zulu "counter of stories" or "singer of praises".
No one can commonly speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany for now to return to its native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometres by bird flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Eitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% affected persons
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or land huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, the worst diseases in Swaziland can be observed on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless ensures a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of the population in Swaziland bear the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of 30.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. Imlongis mostly saw many children on the street who were missing not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to pay a few euros each year to be able to send a child to school and offer her a warm meal per day.
But just a year later, the chorale founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then has been working almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Hesitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis powders and gala belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhage often occur in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute considers that sexual contact between men causes at least four out of five syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungic), blennorrhage and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher incidence of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Institut Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the number has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess in genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, low-ventral pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptom and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contacts.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who frequently changes from sexual partners regularly undergo examinations.
Most rapidly detected ISTs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, gifts, but above all to the funds that the chorists harvest through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"All in all, we've already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, that's what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has a person is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as is the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two pulleys. With the help of the U.S. health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not the case, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wifes
"AIDS is a real taboo," Annette Lennartz explains, "because it's a subject that affects sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These ills sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, Annette Lennartz adds, "but almost nobody uses them.
Culture is different, flesh versus flesh."
In order to foster some cultural exchange, Imongi chorists travel together every two to three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people at the tip of the Black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good mood and joy, but also sometimes throws a tear at some fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where choristers visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers on bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of those chorists who hit foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe provided evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be 20 metres thick.
NASA's US Space Agency has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe provided evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water to the hypothesis of a lifetime on the planet, explains the Chief Scientist of the Messenger Survey, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which the infinite is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, named "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassipée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant flash of a dying star.
The beignet-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, also known as "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the value of the colours.
On this infrared photo, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years in the constellation of Verseau.
His resemblance to a land continent has earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular dye.
Only the infra-red detectors of the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest riddles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and most clear photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tint, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three stretches of dust divide the shining heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the premies of a cosmic carambolation in the Serpentary's constellation: at 400 million light-years from the Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush to each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula, in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and is composed of dust grains which are ten to one hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
One can see the circle consisting of black holes which is 430 million light years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the group of young stars the brightest of our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced from a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists think it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our Look at the Universe: The Main Telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, mirrors of optical telescopes have grown thicker and, thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror itself reaches a diameter of 10,4 meters.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter is still about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radiotelescope.
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by contributing to the computing power of its machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take shots before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This picture shows the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as early as 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have the mission of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists because Messenger orbits much closer to the North Mercure Pole.
The radar data had for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure about it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a failed romanticism.
Aside from the many turnings of the road, the small bus comes down along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost believed in the Black Forest.
But we find ourselves here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we do not know much, except that they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town ploughs with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist site.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only such museum in the world.
It is possible to discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Sirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest documented person was 122, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have still conceived a girl.
Would Sirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the man at the age of Central Asia.
"S Surprisingly elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, without assuming that there was no register of civil status.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is true that people in the Lerik area often reach a age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the Talysh calories-rich meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bar, whose content she untidyly beats.
Eight people live here under a single roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one of his daughters, who have long been adults.
Two little children are also gagging in the house.
In the kitchen, we prepare tea for guests served in typical armadied glass in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly lined up, and under her scarf they hide long braids from a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
In all my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But it all improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who has yet led his country as a dictator, hardly knows any boundaries in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (approximately the same amount as euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long graying son has been right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not abusing words full of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also for the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all members of the opposition confused and hopelessly disappointed are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost excused himself, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don't really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written hastily by the most Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the resulting legal room for manoeuvre to apply a more strict interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests a new, introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all subjects related to sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brightness radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto result in the judicial power being placed under the control of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts were committed to suppressing opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, as can be seen in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Just as doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore interpreted in the draft that Morsi is voting on and that, in his own words, will be "nearly" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Renewed"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it came into effect.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi launched, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its invalidity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was] their constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way as its supporters, had spoken loudly and loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the leadership polls that the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are gross violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto removes all his powers," he deplores Saeda.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.
A protestant on Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely odorous fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this ubiquitous odor, pervades the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-sparing trout and fermented in water for a duration - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then have a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people go for small pieces of fish and stuff a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
Drink kills smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid making it happen under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses softened by the alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was there are not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, though odorous, of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to please it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot down 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they're talking about "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians have difficulty in accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarity.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, at the blond hair and in the eyes of a translucent blue, the image of the northern well-being, with a tray of rakfisk by hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to get noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, except for a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the strings of its stock exchange tight.
"As much as you can ski in winter and do hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and do the tail to buy me what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I am staying in is one of the many places where rakfisk is used for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We think it's the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you score for the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the challenges that await him and in the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico's economy is doing well, from the results that we owe to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people their lives in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before confronting the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that encloses the capital. On its predilection land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once boxed and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside a new sport complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We rely on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of powerlessness, the PRI was defeated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years past outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticism of the opponents who blamed the new President for lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great stateman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that the people of their former governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under motorway bridges, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military were called on to fight against drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the brink of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr.Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto say that at best, he failed to pinpoint the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse their administration of refusing to see the reality face.
In a concrete house, typical of this cramped neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to keep her tears from showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and cadaver rigidity had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old commera, a troubled hawk, a weeping woman.
They want us to accept what they say and stop.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has made the promise that he will give priority to it during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," Olvera said, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, declaring the prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial involves the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's sequestration took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of misappropriating thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate, on Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the American army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during their nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping was under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- occurred one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention at the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he was given to him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms did not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about certain problems and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote "no problems" (after addressing concerns), and yet this did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status as a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted people to withdraw this status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and had fainted once because of heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon at this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were mattresses, blankets, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying long during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would awaken him so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, too, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he should drop his cover that might have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave her.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his brief or his tongs to get hurt, but that he didn't.
That night Manning testified that his underwear, his tons, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will considerably reduce his sentence if he has to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty to the lesser crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all the charges are brought, he shall incur life-long criminal imprisonment.
My identity crisis, Mexico-American
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for "Mexicans", another for "Extrangeros".
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing which way to go.
I grew up in downtown California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my New York friends when they call themselves "Italians."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And on earth that my grandfather was born, there was no need for a special qualification or a trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have the Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the "Extrangers" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are staying in Mexico rather than at risk in the United States.
He wishes to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in in writing half of their territory at the point of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer opportunities.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandfather, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Furthermore, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they touch us as if we were individuals of lower strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexican Americans are opposed to it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has a sense of being part of two countries.
On the other hand, many of the Mexican-Americans I know do not seem to be part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered American.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are everywhere, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to work yourself out, friends.
That's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans always want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
As the same futile arguments persist to know who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is undergoing a change.
The Arab Spring has stolen everything, and whether we want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little further.
Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this deadlock.
A war that does not make any loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Although the ceasefire granted on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will stop forcing the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has broken a scrape.
Having killed some of its leaders and refuted the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded parts of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken and caused Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilee and say that the growing Islamist is running around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, passing through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was boxed.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fires in Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that plagues the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why do these fucking Palestinians giggle by giving them a state?
If they headed the West Bank, would they not throw rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will take it away; but it may change the Arab spring.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good wish -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two to three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by the majority of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now endeavour to end the flow of arms to Gaza, in the same way as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packs of neutral cigarettes came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand name
This law came into force in Australia is a world premiere, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's most strict tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter youth from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
While Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and although these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pressured against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have stated that this would boost trade in the black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"The adverse consequences will come from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Fans from China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that the Act had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-run company, said that the demand for cigarette cases, especially silicone to hide the horrific packaging, increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the high court of Australia.
Ha stated that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the most important place for excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has struggled to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia has stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
Industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had had discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you save the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which a picture of mouth tumor appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising the arms in heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day at an airport to wait for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the nuisance with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll go back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Romanian history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes up very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that John D. Eastwood, an Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, was identified and debated in different ways.
After many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that is "to want to do something, but not to get started in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he would wish.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Anxiety can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a matter of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the loud sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard low-level TV said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had a hard time concentrating, but they didn't know why, and they attributed this problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task or take over, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "how to look at objects on an assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, now, we know that when you're torturing or griffining, these gestures, often regarded as signs of trouble, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Study has shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "predisposition scale to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes assertions like, "Even the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centers of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get more bored than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly embroiled.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and during their homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported getting bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's unemployment rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse of certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers refer to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The trouble is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or himself, says Professor Fenske.
"This self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child does not only learn to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feel comfortable outside of the constant boiling of activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has meaning," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stop times.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and a football player in Colorado, was charged for something that will soon become legal in his condition: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without further action.
Police have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor marijuana possession, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continuing to indict the people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales in their neighbourhoods.
"Things change so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora police chief, in eastern Denver.
Washington state regulators also ask themselves a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether you like it or not, is ahead of most of the regulatory states on marijuana, first of all regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liqueur Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The law of Washington, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which leaves a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system still does not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees adequate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within 30 km of a school, park, playground or nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City actorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer continue the people aged 21 and over who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the "attorney district" (Procurer of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a more strict vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession matters, mainly in order to pressure users to get them to be detoxified.
At present, 119 people are charged with 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are further charged.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that was a recognized offence at the time," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural locations such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer have adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana custody cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework appropriate to the personal consumption of marijuana is not an easy thing.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the public prosecutor's representatives, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and who expresses himself as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a lot of their lives trying to bring to justice people who were consuming marijuana, too, have a hard time accepting that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for drug legalization.
While defenders and government representatives provide for a new border of legalized sales, they are anxious to wait for the federal government's guidelines, which always design the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will pass.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to break down the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there is a lot to bet that it is opposed to licensed marijuana sales for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not expected the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than the state vote.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was damaged and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It is not just today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and my elder brother studied in what was an eminent place for me to know, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The journal of The Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with certainty that I was gone after being forced to drink in dark cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and was the subject of constant intimidation.
Not because of my rather indignant name, or because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowing, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of middle-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, in the same way as gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent BBC-based documentary Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right"), dedicated to student politics, which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, we discovered the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, has a complete silver and moves with a chrome-plated head rod.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats in the establishment of increased tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said to a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of OOCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards those who are central-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking about this in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered September 1986, when I was 18 years old and had a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted for the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcoming week, when new students met with others and teachers, I had a foretaste of what was going to happen later.
I found that not only were the professors involved in sarcasms towards Tory students, but they were also enjoying it.
It was as if the policy on the strike miners, the privatization and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a puzzling face, was easily taken away.
"Do the Thatherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - at last, if you're not too busy making friends," he started out with a harbinger.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
During dinner tonight, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who presented as a member of OOCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Everyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already tough enough for me, but they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even harder for you.
Most of the Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with what Mrs Thatcher had said.
This scheme failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who ironically had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took back the refractory.
I was perverted, you dirty bastard.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have just been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his Marxist-determinist accession to history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to do the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's for you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most serious thing about the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Internally roaring with shame, I admitted to being a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and treated them as "old fools".
The respite was short-lived.
It's my father who put the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed up in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can treat me with wet chicken pleurnichard.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian Couturier customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high- Couture models created for his couture house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the cornerstone of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette megats on your beautiful carpet as some of the pop music stars do," Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza says.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of the beauties of the past time like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charism of the seamstress.
Several years ago, after a parade on Spain's Square in Rome, we went to his apartment to dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go out of fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobility line parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves people well and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to slide on the podium to admire a "public" of dream bearing the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
Among this audience of mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the seamstress in 2006
Many of her customers say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the seamstress's muses.
"I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much, they are bright and lighten his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The modest princess Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a cleavage to fall off.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodriguez d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg preserves the evening dresses of the seamstress with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories that she vehicles".
The "roy" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the seamstress thus calls its seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with incrustations of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a four and a half-metre stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnobled for years by the "knowledge-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated by the Légion d'Honneur, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any spouse of its clients.
"I'm refined, calm, careful and perfect look have always jumped to my eyes," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years had no effect on him."
If she's a princess who says so...
The toughest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case with Antonio Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by wearing the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the East of Indonesian Java Island.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas emanating from the earth's bowels solidifies itself with the contact of the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh about 70 kilos in total, it installs them in two baskets in bamboo that it loads on its shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano which peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted bearers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, to a tortoise, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euros for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, it spawns a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the balance that a mining company has installed somewhat in front of them at 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) for each trip," explains Anto, who generally travels three trips a day.
Each one takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows it to win 18,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a surhuman effort, it is the threefold of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the monthly average wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," the carrier who once worked as a mason on the island of Bali says.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (EUR 6.20 per day) and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, it is as undisputed as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they were Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to become Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Poored by life, this young and intelligent friend could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood mass with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur never ceases to wail at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto went down into the crater lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increment per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," Madrusin protested, a 42-year-old porter who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, between 10 and 18 years old.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur hurts the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... which obviously add their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, 53-year-old Unainik can only charge 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers from there by a goat path invaded by the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says by opening my mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The senior of her five children, aged 30, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery of generation by generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem incredible that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a pulley in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to make people "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take that lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he found himself above 2, considered to be the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of living goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she says.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, particularly Chinese people who are accused of drawing wages downwards and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore last year has had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "footballs", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers real estate company, claims that his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger houses.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admitted that the new standards provided clearer instructions to promoters, who had previously been putting sticks in the wheels if they wished to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young man of about twenty years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babysitting, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the field of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does it understand the dangers to which it is exposed by spreading on the Internet events that it would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with personal and "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," Jorge says, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm talking to my friends, too.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would do the stupid thing," he says.
The boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother's part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them on," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friends list.
"I'm not worried about it because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any advances to him or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyber-harcement are not foreign to the young boy.
A close to one of my friends was racked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on in private."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photographs of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber-harcement," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to look for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what should be disclosed, published or said at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective, while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think about it.
"They say not to do so is no use," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a foreigner, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you've published?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you do every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Now of the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary teacher and an education adviser, said that it was essential for parents to consciously read the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have strong foundations for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that foreigners should not be told.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today ended in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency have initially reported that it would be disclosed after the summit was concluded, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to summit information has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among journalists was that given by press officers from some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, causing some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Later, Peru's presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Arab South America Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested at the press, it had also not broadcast the declaration also called Lima Declaration, as it had been previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but have limited information to a maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that sets out a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear both parties' pleas in Lima's trial against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we bring today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, handing President Humala a hand hand alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read out the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important approaches to achieving the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to low-priced Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to anticipate a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, particularly in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aiming at a greater connection with Ecuador although it did not give more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the inauguration of the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency of the regional bloc on a pro tempore basis.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, had to take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had been entertained during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship promoted by the Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still some reactionary areas that we want to have in the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favour of the rebuilding of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who slam our ears don't compromise anything, unlike us, the South Americans, we all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but has, on the contrary, respected his "profound democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticises the Swedish justice that demanded that he submit in his territory to an interrogation concerning a alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish own legislation allows him to do so by videoconferencing, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorian President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being enclosed in a small space without being able to perform outdoor exercises.
"It acts on anyone's health," he concludes.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the assignment of an ex-conduct that would enable him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and stressed that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe conduct from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows it, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malevolent or perverse politicians, but the evil journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this context, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalist "not the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward its re-election, "it would deepen the revolution in order to continue the path and draw the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the Veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempts of disguised coup d'état", because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the correct resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "beneficial that Latin America should refer to international forums if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgement."
Referring to the eventuality of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although this is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost primary schools in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If you ever forgive us, I'll do it, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse from President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when the test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his own illness and began to inform himself about it and his harassment was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit at the Guadalajara Civilian Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided telling him to say goodbye "because he was voiceless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit leader Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes as reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system presented by patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years old," explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it must be known that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is necessary to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for this, we have to propose screening tests in a massive way, to all those who ask for it".
The experts and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do her screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I blow up three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given a hundred packages, that is very good, but it results, that today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, adolescents are found.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not only sold to counters, but found in public toilet distributors and in the places that young people attend.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked whether there would be a condom distribution within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination is by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal means.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who don't.
A judgment ratified by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would appear, therefore, that the survival procedures of Mexican law-authorized companies are not valid in the country on the starboard, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup to the judgment of June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to refer three inconsistencies to the United States Supreme Court.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law Act for the Unity of International Trade Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without inter-corporate voting, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here are about half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there was still the votes of the subsidiaries, in all manner of way the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is, the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
Data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had encountered since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the costs to the country.
For the time being, the Gonzalez Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The application of insurance will demand non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("a friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Bankruptcy was detailed, noting that this would release it from the agreements signed by the two countries to set it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they summarize Vitro and they summize the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's unions against the former patron of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Union of Air Pilots has already encountered problems.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and Values, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're joining the Dragon Mart.
Meeting at the end of the week in an amphitheater of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal center of sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the great wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East to oppose the monumental project that is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government highlighted a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement, known as ACTA's English acronym, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
"Hetin" Reyes basketball's balloon-trottor spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, he traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemns him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vacqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and souvenirs that recall his unstandard route, bear witness to it.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all his memories, those he most affectionate are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"This was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vacqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a great many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired at the 1981 championship, the year Jerome Mancy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead in the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a hard player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of the best shooters.
I remember he was saying that if Mancy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gaussa would help us try to win another.
He rejoiced at the Vaqueros championship with Gaussa, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and those of Mancy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not let us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Cuba Pan American Games in 1991, when we won the gold and put a scrape on the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mancy, Gaussus, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 due to a problem of knees.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the Neuquén pre-Olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And this does not take his trajectory into account in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the NSB had up to 17 teams in a season.
What is left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field personnel and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for John Ross Ewing's leading role, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, fearable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose unscrupulous oil magnate role J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who had returned this year to J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday evening of complications of a cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving's holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived his life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis with Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of my dreams" series broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this one, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an enticing genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her back to his home.
He also played in two comedies that remained in little time in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are roles well received by the critic in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and its relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among others, the series reached a record hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
She was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot her.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man, but with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray in custody).
"I know what it would be like to be an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, remembered Hagman's Friday as an "immaise man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with a great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
For the time being, neither the Warner nor the TNT channel have reported on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth to Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who has known celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to counsel Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps in the theatres of New York in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': The impietable memoirs of J.R.)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist restless patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to be operated and then," he says in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
This semester, when professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hammock there: the end of the "great discount" of the Maya calendar on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gulf that some called "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times thought would trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we were saying it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach on the "end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, just titled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "up to the very night of the end of the supposed world," Restall said.
The courses have proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his high-level course, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It makes me happy to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, from the University of Rutgers-Camden.
For fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course teaching this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less one teacher, told us to believe in the end date of the world on December 21.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in some way we have discredited it," says Julie zegle, a senior student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it's only a key date on the calendar," Restall said.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to grow.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being given here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many dates assumed of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosopher about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to "the end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
