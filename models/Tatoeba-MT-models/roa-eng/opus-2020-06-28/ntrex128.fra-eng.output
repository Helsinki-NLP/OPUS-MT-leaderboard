Members of the Assembly of Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Welsh voters are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rallies.
A Labour elected member indicated that his group was concerned about the fact that the symbol "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who do not come from Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (Marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is spoken as the letter u in English from the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, stated that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is the latter".
The 2007 Law on the Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act 2017) grants the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was largely supported.
On the subject of membership, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
It seems that other suggestions are made by the members of the Assembly, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name during discussions on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve an old contentious of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has stressed that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change in name is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin silenced
"Old people I talked to say that there was traditionally a bar and a church in every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal for the bars to get cold.
Today, "the same way is no longer common, he says.
"We used to go to the bar and go to his neighbor's, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted well before what is expected of those responsible, and it is of concern to them: "before or late, they will return to the departure room".
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will rush the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members of them," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left the premises in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching around, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks painted to be employed or to obtain a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor in the direction of the church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played in July, gave her a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took a place in front of the largest carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
In recent months, there has been a great deal of discussion about the remue-membrance of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13 year olds injured by sharks during lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming with help and started paying up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy pushed out screams of joy to have had a catch, and then he understood that in reality he
He had been bitten.
As he arrived near the young man, Hammel noticed that he presented an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was yelling for everyone to come out of the water: there's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami beach to Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 shark species, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hands down on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams and garnit them with similar rays to supermarkets, full of aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the British aesthetic market of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, wider beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves to be conclusive.
The supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Esse, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume seller header concessions at two shops in Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second opened in the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to grow their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their purchases online and to head to nearby stores for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said that outlets will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter stores discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up points of sale Argos in hundreds of stores and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel the sales of goods of current consumption and to profitability the acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics rays of the British chain had resulted in a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but he ended a controversy over the distribution of the benefits of pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
It was after selling his 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for an amount of 125 million pounds in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was supposed to play a role in introducing a wide range of skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes the buying habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from an agreement of £11 million
The star of the television program Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the removal of the host Holly Willoughby from a contract of up to £11 million linked to his home decoration brand, to devote himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the brand of interior decoration and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has made angry Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior decoration activity in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the beloved child on TV revealed, during a meeting that was held under tension at the seat of the Dragon's Den star commercial empire in Marlow, Bukinghamshire, that his new contracts, which amounted to 1.5 million pounds sterling, would no longer allow him to deal with Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The Truly brand was assimilated to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the fortune of the host estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone with no voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The headquarters of Marlow is filled with products ready to be sold."
Specialists believe that the departure of this morning's host, who is among the most "bankable" celebrities in Britain, could cause millions to lose to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions to candles, to indoor clothing or articles, and the risk of delayed launch.
Moreover, this could put an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
Couples left together on vacation and Peter Jones holds 40% of shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of I'm A Celebrity's ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was flattering, but finally we love each other.
Trump mocked the media who criticized him because of his comment that some feel "unworthy of a president," and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
He scratched, taking a voice from a TV journalist.
"I have not given in at all."
He said that Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified as the first, which took place in Singapore in June, as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on this denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday to world leaders, at the UN General Assembly, that there was no "relevant response" from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump rally speech, he offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says North American President.
We broke the armed conflict.
"millions of people were reportedly killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the completion of missile testing, the release of hostages and the remnants of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized by pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was not supposed to be needed.
Over 10 per cent of Lombok's population was scattered, but no state of national disaster was decreed as a necessary condition for the triggering of international assistance.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit," said Ms. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization has set up a team to visit Palu, it still does not know whether work on the ground will be permitted.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite his constant shocks, the country lacked the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refuges have been built in Aceh, but are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given, no alarm siren heard in Palu, which probably contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims, is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the sites of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and spent considerable money to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Mr Joko's government, which is called upon to stand before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure in connection with the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, in the background of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge achieves equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at the Liverpool Premier League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was run from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot at the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reaches Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its road at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to place myself, take hold of the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to make a maximum of time," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot."
Chelsea took 1 to 0 in half time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker tipped a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before heading toward the middle of the field and sprinting side Liverpool.
Kovacic made a fast going and coming in the middle of the field,
then made a magnificent deep shot that leads Hazard into the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and ended his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the doorman of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the group phase of the Champions League, Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the stadium San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of tsunami victims is 832
The disaster management agency indicated on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami review reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7,5 that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was swept away by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 0755 hours, the 44-year-old woman with knife cuts was discovered on John Street of Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police exhort the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The police captain, Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street at Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspicious of contact.
In particular, I call on the taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their Dashcam and asked them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property where she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is under way and the police indicated that it informed the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him with no voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
One police officer confirmed that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
saying, "It's too horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were placed inside the cord and one outside.
Several agents were monitoring the building on the inside side of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101, or to contact the crime-free organization anonymously at 0800,555 111, as indicated in registry 247 of September 30.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr.Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that "in view of the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell's debate in the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct the iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is precise or not is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated."
China: A Pig Kills a Breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identifyed as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a pigstore on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, said the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby piggy was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and blood flowed from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutilated the herd to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 0440 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the breeder or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incidents and allow police officers to collect evidence.
The farmer's family Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously wounding the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away from him.
In 2012, while an Oregon farmer had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood could lead to this type of behaviour.
"They are rather playful animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
Just show them the respect that is due to them," he says.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane are expected to cause severe precipitation in the south-eastern United States.
In accordance with the forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakened as it moves above the coldest waters on the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause aversions in north-eastern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Winds had been blowing at 135 km/h (category 1) since 5:00 a.m., Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
During this time, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows to the East, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches Monday the Basse-California Peninsula in the form of a storm, the Rosa hurricane will cause intense tropical humidity to the North, in the southwest of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Averses will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in south-west regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Disperse tropical rains may cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into decayed rivers and storms would produce wind gusts and dust whirlwinds by locations.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the Californian coast.
Total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
These could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical adversaries will reach Arizona Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitation will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Major temperature variations are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropicals will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will be subject to considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm beginning of October months, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Several-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels Thursday, the striking auditions of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accusing her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, the broadcasting services have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a coup: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured that she was 100% confident that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had committed suicide on her person and had tried to remove her clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate stripe, claimed to be equally certain to 100% that it had never happened.
According to a report by Nielsen, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have widely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most watched channel during the audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing of 3.26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not fail once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken in part by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to go to the court hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the live-in search sequence.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator's doors closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more about it at the committee meeting.
All cable and radio channels covered the live session a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, which the minority democrats demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after having met with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was heavy in the balance, as the Republicans did not actually get the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate the allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Great Britain: May accuses opponents of Brexit of making "small politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making the "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a picture of Theresa May in cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "cleanly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the cause of the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a fatally shot suspect who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, has been beaten and is charged with second-degree murder, said the Red Baton Police Service.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Founded at the scene of the crime, Simpson's DNA was worn by the glasses, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson told the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the medical examiner of the Baton-Red parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the fugitive task force of Louisiana State, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University police, and citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement forces for their "commitment and quest for justice."
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach said the team was "done and in shock" after Wayde's death news.
"We fear this kind of event all the time," Wade regretted.
Mexico : a volcano cracks ashes
The ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having registered a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several storms and earthquakes from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimillco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in activity at the volcano level at 72 km from the capital, since a earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and the separatists near the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protestors and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repelled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs at them and coloured powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not dissipate tourists.
Hotnesses also erupted later in the day, while police used mathracs to contain confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence who were chanting "neither forgotten nor forgiven", faced unionist supporters shouting "long life in Spain".
14 protesters with mild injuries were treated according to the local press.
One year after the 1 October referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions still remain alive in the independent region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, the opponents to the secession having largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independentist groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It had the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope of independence from Catalonia.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents were weeping with joy at the idea of voting, but now we are in a deadlock," he laments.
Despite their capital, though thin, victory at the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties had trouble maintaining the momentum this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained while awaiting trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the demonstration of police support on her phone, said that politicians were responsible for blocking the situation, both on the one hand and on the other.
"Tensibility only goes up," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arresting Londonderry: Men Strike A House By Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly darkening on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballinagard Crescent Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have been shot at.
Livingston wins the 1 to 0 match against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
Recently ranked, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games at Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place itself in the second position of the ranking, equally with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads to 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the League of Europe on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she extended her track of 6 games invading the division, and her main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may be proud that she hasn't lost the least encounter yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of moved opponents
Holt's team could have moved forward well before marking, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to drill, but was relieved of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a headstep by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could embarrass them thanks to tactics worked.
That's where the ultimate goal came from.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a goal in the middle of the field.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but were faced with an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely concerned.
The second half experienced the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's arrest.
Ranger Guardian Allan McGregor stopped a Scott Pittman strike from his foot, while Lithgow was successful in playing one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's keeper pushed back all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault of hand.
Livingston's "Scene" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have not changed almost since they returned to the top, but the merit returns largely to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in breath for the entire duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerard, they did not live up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and managed to break the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which are in the middle of a table.
Mitigated Home of President Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been raised, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Calling for security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10.15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequented Deptford road to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescues arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police said that the officers were working hard to identify the individual and prevent his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured during a riot
The high-security prison officer said that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The riot began in the prison HMP Long Lartin, located in Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized riot officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, agents were treated for slight facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: "Trained personnel specially deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officers were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiards.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial to areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week. The Rosa hurricane is heading for the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden floods.
The national weather service has already issued warning floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rains announcing as early as Monday evening.
The national weather service based in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center include 5-10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per location in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central area of the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Basin, are expected to record 2.5-5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flood.
Although the risk of flooding should not be lightened, rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, slightly more than 40% of Arizona has at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," reportsweather.com.
The Rosa hurricane begins its path on the coasts, on the Basse-California peninsula.
Always of great power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and could lead to flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Basse-California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border Tuesday morning, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the Tuesday evening.
"Range rains are expected in Basse-California, north-west Sonora and south-west desert and are the main danger," the National Hurricane Center explained.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly sudden floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital and his condition is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset indicated that they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the side of Radstock.
The officers called on people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed the intelligence and courage of Kavanaugh" this day.
"A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in Virginia-Western.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
The first decision-making vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a collaborator of the Republican party in CNN.
Indonesia: a earthquake and tsunami are killing hundreds of people, the stocktaking continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, mostly carried by huge waves that hit the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebs.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
Earthquake, magnitude 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not immediately flee, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (NPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami has not arrived alone. It has driven cars, pieces of wood, dwellings, it has taken everything away with it," Nugroho explained, saying that the tsunami had moved in the middle of the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and scrambled bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replies continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (PPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the debris of ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be greater on 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" since Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for failing to disseminate the information that a tsunami had affected Palu, although officers said the waves had arrived as long as the alert was published.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs a building yelling freneticly at street passersby that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell down on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general power failure that has cut off all communications in Palu. Therefore, it has been difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to provide assistance by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people always have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: There are more than 800 deaths in the tsunami victims.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of the World Vision of Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he says.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is still considered regional," says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the disappeared people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagi.
"As an elder in paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they never got my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 during the reloading of an automatic vending machine
On Friday morning, robbers extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was reloading an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The vehicle's driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, says Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly reported many suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information on their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been calling Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his coming for "emotional reasons", explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
"I think that "Yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West explained earlier this year, referring to his album title with his host Big Boy.
"Then I'm you, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means “the only one”, to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also played on the line of union and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President Elected Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on the place of Tlatelolco never "to use military force to punish the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allocations and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this area, according to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several US government actors made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the AI innovation leader by 2030.
"Doubled funds for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries have a lead on the United States, and we're looking for the next great breakthrough in AI," Lee explains.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in the AI domain comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the best-rated American Othello player. He then joined the Microsoft Research management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and has asked when the next competition will take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns academic leaders, it's business," Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers," he says.
China's Council of State Affairs unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve partners in industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
In parallel, U.S. legislation that has been working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians take part in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia had their voice heard during a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces of Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right in its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents said that change would affect the ethical identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% stake required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was as follows: "Are you for membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which have escaped the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, enough members of parliament stated that they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of the voters enrolled at the end of the poll.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote to membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments, and the unemployment rate in the country is above 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is less than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian network Telma, estimated participation to be 57%.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent of the votes are required plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, takes a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine butter received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before pouring into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green suits.
He bypassed a defender before defeating others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of this to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guard Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," said Pep Guardiola, the coach of the team, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was there at the time."
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the First League match,
29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues front sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble parties against the Rockies
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination game for the Rockies, real legends in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took it 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their first division title.
"Even if this game is not at stake, we want to go to Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in front of a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher starting on Sunday, but would be inclined to leave Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Right is 18-7 with an average of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 steps and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation that led to his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for formidable candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
The Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it over the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democrats as "anger, wicked, and lying."
He referred to the Justice Committee of the Senate of the United States and Senator Democrat Diane Feinstein, who had earned her the privilege of being hurried by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you disclosed the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party considered not to be welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same because she rose against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the gathering of the Nottingham East Labour Friday said, "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That's exactly what Friday evening general meetings were for my eight years as a Labour Party MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today with many gatherings and the promise of milder and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy's takeover. Colleagues with whom I thought to share a same political vision began waiting for me to return my jacket and to take positions opposite my convictions, whether it is about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following an abusive pull on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And that's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I was addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a defrosting of sexist or racist words every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in the current policy is the normalization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted through the motions of defiance and changes in the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: looking down, not expressing my ideas so loud, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the motion on Friday is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think that this is not really the time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my electors, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a parliamentary member of the Nottingham East constituency.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invading
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Rugby Scotland Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invading team of the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defence and the way in which they grasp the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can be pleased with this match.
"So far, we've been tested, but we're still invading, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Braille to them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish horseman Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak. Jason Baggot took hold of an unprocessed test.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time. He scored and transformed a solo test to mount the score at 17-5 for Ayr to pause.
Melrose has well started the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, has reduced the gap to five points.
He followed a long wait for him because of a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a civière. During the recovery, Ayr resumed his lead with a test by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose attempted his chance with an unprocessed trial by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team came back in hands and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to have tapped Climo while he didn't have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's maul, which progressed.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent the Gregor Henry wingman away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game star launches in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, has decided to make a career in the restoration. The comedian has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old man embodies Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-stars with his long-standing stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series that arrives will be the end of the show. Kiernan seems to prepare for the post-Craglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "floating environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Titicaca Lake to Amazonia, the naval bases show the following motorcycle: "The sea is right for us.
Recovery is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia blocked, the memory of a lost coast for the benefit of Chile during a conflict of bloody resource in the nineteenth century is always well present. Just as the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for decades. Bolivia is looking forward to a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and obviously expects a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivarians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large-screen basis throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will take a decision in favor of the Bolivian demand. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for the re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to go back to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Chile, and that few things will change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations Netherlands-based body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed him.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has learned all the good Chilean will that remained, she has suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which to date remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country did not dispose of its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
This was expressed on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un, the current North Korean leader.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to believe that maintaining the sanctions and US opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war will close the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant pre-disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness of relinquishing an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security is debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in caps, perhaps soon available in your boutiques
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, no longer look.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of throbbing oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honoured the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
All extravagant hats from each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their relaxing pieces into the parades.
Valentino's light room was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge reminiscent of a feather, which swallowed the head of the mannequins.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-peeled cakes, a witch hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had their lips sewn and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than High-Couture.
A creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking about a cone of melted ice.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the seal of the "Bomb", the broad-breasted straw hat that the stars pull out of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hardly portable hat that flooded social networks has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the mannequin in swimwear that wore it.
The bag in orange raffia burnt, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the PE19 La Riviera parade at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools are working to prepare their students for higher education, for their careers and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and setting up an appropriate school curriculum, we note that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a relationship of trust with people in other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of the reviews this year, it is clear that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students obtained the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A UK Employment and Skills Commission survey conducted in 2014 shows that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future thanks to this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master enough a foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will benefit from better chances of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important for the United Kingdom in 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialized personnel in the field.
The Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds them.
It is clear that, in a global trading environment, languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are watching LeBron James's debut at Lakers in Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in the opening season, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers Mike Trudell’s reporter tweeted that James would probably play for a few short minutes.
After the training, earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump's Campaign in West Virginia ( YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, especially in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vote to confirm the vacancy at the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump sought to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections and to prevent the Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidates' hearings to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims first and foremost to help Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President said in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will go to as many states as possible at the beginning of this busy election campaign," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Oiio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday, this will be Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope on Sunday's simple approach
After three simple, Saturday afternoon ants could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is an invented sports concept of all pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments such as this one.
So where would they put the momentum now?
"They were driving with six points in advance and now four, so it gives us a little wings," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points of advance and twelve other points to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have a feeling of having a little bit of the wind in the doll and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can joke about having each of three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be terribly effective from tea to green and set an example.
The cries of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he was led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he still believes the American team in high school.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all there is left to each of these players, now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair won four out of four games and is not entitled to the error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as the gamers to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to whom a potential European victory delight while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time have different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, an early-morning football hero, while he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never come out of.
On Sundays, however, no one is here to help you.
Furballs and ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can shift into a blink of an eye.
Europe has been better teamed up so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this session of ants has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some, especially in the country, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's kilns and kilns.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a distressed Tiger Woods, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Well decided to retain the title she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 on early-morning furs, in front of a messy American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the ants and won two victories, but they failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must reach eight points on Sunday 12 on simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European team to pick up four points in a row, while Molinari and he, known as "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup history to get four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they beat the pair composed of the American beginner Bryson Dechambaau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who had been hanging out during the two games on Saturday, had a few rounds, but now he lost 19 of his 29 games in kiln and kiln, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning's furballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the ovens, winning 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in a cool but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the furballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the ants, having lost the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although the Furyk team, which held the crown, had nothing but to play the game to maintain its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not get away from a Sunday counter-attack.
North Korea states that disarmament cannot be "nowhere" unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions strengthened his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Organization's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken "important steps of good will" last year, such as ending nuclear testing and missiles, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticism of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between an American President and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "Korean peninsula denuclearization" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to bring an end to the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also denied requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the "war end declaration".
“Those who think that sanctions can make us use do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the denuclearization party was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Despite all this, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he had declared before the General Assembly that it was inevitable to point north-Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened before the United Nations last year to "fully destroy" North Korea, has not been commended this year for the courage with which Kim has implemented disarmament measures, but has added that much remains to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no time limit had been set."It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until full, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the following hours, North Korea denounced its "ghost methods".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim calls for the security guarantees provided by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight against the growing machist tendency of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noticed that most students at the best university in the world can't take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is in his opinion the first of the kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to her
At the end of the day, a student approached me and said, "Why do I have to be told that only in the last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their well-being in general.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleeplessness during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee bars, curtains, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedding.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behaviour instantly.
However, in our view, they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of the pride of "a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of inanimation, making them hungry at all times.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that the course had opened his eyes to him and urged him to insist that he be offered all over the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to offer all graduate students a similar curriculum before joining the well-known institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and waking time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which may disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to overthrow Gerrard's men
The Rangers were hit again outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first victory since his 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerard his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at the drift, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short-inspired, failed to egalize.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston stands in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, umpire Calum Spence having had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept out Ayr in the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 who took out a point at Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team was suffocating his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored two minutes away, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-defendant Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he would have had to benefit from a penalty after the frank coup when Steven Lawless and entered into collision with him, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers took only two shots in the first period, but the former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly was hardly disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted in the middle of time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing presented itself in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston still continued to urge visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett dancing long balls on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor worked hard to push Jacobs back before Lithgow passed the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty at the end of the game while he was struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger, Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, it's for sure that it jumps here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
In the course of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn in the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and colorectal.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has shown itself in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
A MAGA helmet coifé, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trump diatribe after it passed to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was hit on the plateau after a broken performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to stand for election in 2020.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, who sang by wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism were my concern, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe recording was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a quarter of an hour in the backstage because of his cap.
"They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a dump," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the goof?" and said he would wear his head as a superman, because no one can tell him his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
Her comments attracted her from the public at least twice, and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the scene said to the magazine: "A dead silence fell on the whole plateau."
West had been called to replace in the last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West unveiled a lot of people singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the conservative leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU TO HAVE YOUR HEART TO THE FOLLOW."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and overthrows an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the traces of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Pffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name into a symbol, then the artist's name previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of Attempt to Kill After White Gun Aggression in a Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear before the Belfast Trial Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, gets into toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fine blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent mediaeval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took it to the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to get passed for hard to cook to get respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he says "something is wrong" and addresses the question of toxic masculinity at #MeToo time.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covedette of Game of Thrones, also 31, admitted that he was "firmly" to address this issue.
"Personally, I deeply believe that we have misled masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculinous characters.
He continued: "What behaviour is innate, what behaviour has been inculcated?
What do television and street learn from young boys who encourage them to think that they have to behave like this to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or suites when the series ends next summer, claiming that he had finished with "the battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a recovery of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the character lover of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie's family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was virtually zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS sufferers in China increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70 to 90 per cent of homosexual men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese Government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters regrets that a GOP employee has disclosed data on senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "complex theories".
On Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to legislators.
Los Angeles Democratic stated that these statements were supported by "extreme right" experts and websites.
"Speaking lies, lies, and still infamous lies," Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information was posted on Thursday by a stranger to Capitol Hill during the Senate sitting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information to a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false allegation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press officer.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
She must not question the accuser's motives.
She must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the laws concerned" to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English has struck again. Parish of Rowan Atkinson, sub-doubt spy
It has now become a tradition of searching for the Brexit's reach in any new British film and it seems to apply to this replay of action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new export chance of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his cocky eyes and rubber face, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - that name indicating first of all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-anglophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamourous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the television advertisements Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two friendly moments.
I liked Johnny English as I approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades struck briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is enhanced, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves in confidence with comedy.
Humour seems more oriented towards children than towards adults and, for me, Johnny English's far-fetched misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's character.
The day-to-day premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the vast disarray of the on-duty agents - a low-profile role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pumpy character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is no great deal to put under the tooth in the scenario.
His intelligence advisers inform him that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that Johnny English must be disturbed himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolmaster, but who secretly teaches about how to become a secret agent: some beautiful farces here, because English proposes a Rock Academy-style spying academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create great trouble with Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the leadership of the billionaire technological charismatic charisma that is capable of solving the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
Both English and Bough launch their odyssey of plentiful jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set fire to a vibrant French restaurant; they create a chaos by slipping on the luxurious Volta sailboat; and Français triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All stops are secured for this last sequence, but nevertheless, there's not much for children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop myself from thinking, like for other films by Johnny English: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan for the British to work for four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to receive the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
The substitute Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed his determination to regain power in the hands of "anonymous administrators" and "profits" in public utility companies.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their layoffs since the Labour Government could operate "deductions" due to alleged driving deviations.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the private business capital to employees, which will impoverish up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week following the FBI's inquiry into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the findings of the Bureau could induce Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60-minute program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when those allegations were made, and I asked him "Did you do that?"
He was resolved, determined, and unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she names couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don't see anything new that changes."
What did the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people rushing to the Great Lawn in Central Park so not only to take advantage of the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are prepared to pay a VIP ticket), the viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, send an e-mail to a world leader, telephone or make any other useful efforts to raise public awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the twelve years that remain?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allows them to persuade them to demand a call for action, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who advocate for many different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to encouraging global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies that amount to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising out of its actions, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been paid or lifted.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed to "helping children to develop their full potential", while promising to Rwanda support 35 million pounds Sterling to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens' messages.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the crowd Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the company of over 5,000 actions to ask the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great movements of civil rights and the struggle against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to avoid Russian energy coming into the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States can, together with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstructed to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "Energy Consumer Spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
"With regard to Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the operation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one string in its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at the time when the Trump administration has committed to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, Trump says, makes Berlin a "prisoner" city of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, "I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has caused negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting for the presidential elections in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the top," she says.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider applying to the Presidentials."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump during the public gathering, claiming that he "leaded this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters are not of the opinion that it is expected to run in 2020.
According to the poll of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts "probable" voters stated that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of very prominent Democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after his appointment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently testing, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries that our soldiers are coming back with," she told the public at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a "tabou subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if they respect what their comrades and air force members, and each other military, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of a gun in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a statement in favour of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a decision issued in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "is unaware of decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law stipulates that all applications for asylum must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae said in his memory.
The lawyers also argued in the memoir that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants harms the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Ail is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions on June 11, in his announcement of the said policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all problems -- even the most serious ones -- that people meet every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her child-fever boy in Palu, in an evacuation center in the empty city.
"Every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen visiting their destroyed houses, collecting devastation and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquakes were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outside because of strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told him how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China's "Intimidation" Through "Advertising Propaganda" · Global Voices
A week after a Chinese official newspaper went through a four-page commercial boasting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to get involved in the US parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation China refutes.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. elections, Trump noted what U.S. officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralysed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at striking exporters from States such as Iowa who supported the Republican Trump Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is doubling his intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertisement in the Les Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, at Beijing's press desk, you will find few contentious voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the troubling Chinese economic trajectory, as the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans alienate the electricians near the mid-term elections due to the debacle of Kavanaugh
While many high-ranking Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely lively, and most Republicans have already publicly demonstrated that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29, in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University stated "that we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation are sufficient to calm the anger of voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National Spokesman of the Progressive MovementOn Group, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28 according to Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang "The month of November is coming!" in the corridor of the Senate while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overstated," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban electricity and in young electors aged 18 to 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court appointee, analysts have suggested that the reaction would be likely to be alive if the Republicans made the confirmation move forward.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that "It became a mess for the GOP."
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps elected democrats in the television newspaper.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the Americans appear to be divided on the credibility of both parties, a small majority hanging on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the people consulted believed absolutely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% stated that they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when he studied Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved as well as those authorized to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said it was a joke that Inrupt was aimed at "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this the "personal responsibility via the data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on a contract on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and he are not still in discussion with "Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely crammed in an instant.
"We do not ask them for permission."
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the [Inrupt] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an Ecclesiastical of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, claimed that he was "brightly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann directed his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of campaign cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before jumping a campaign gun on his own and to abscond three soldiers of the detachment.
On 4 October 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, age 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "one thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a well filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, there were 13 combats, including six on the main card, and it was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, United Kingdom viewers were considered when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to have stayed awake until early morning especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the passage to children's animated drawing as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, the Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m. this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children's programming."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about rediffusion, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"However, it is six o'clock in the morning a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program moved, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more to the fans and we have ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in terms of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has breathed his motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everyone [was] not like me."
As part of the first show of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, took leave for several months because of her illness.
As a wreck in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the true things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medallist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year in order to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to restore "hope" to others.
The triple world champion claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he trusted that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same high and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought I'd win a gold medal," he says.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not agreed that he would die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be seated in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Daddy, you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and to die so that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at home at the Olympic Games, there is nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - which had accompanied him during preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
An out of shape Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to recover to avoid being a unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was set aside by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's furballs and ants.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fivefold major champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the refinement of his play at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He was never the greatest of the men, even at the top of his career. At 48 years old, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the mishaps.
And as if the course wasn't overwhelming enough in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday match, faces Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 simple games, get a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a kick in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup matches ever played.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven resignations, although Furyk claimed that his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun to measure up to him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play."
The captain of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not negligible advance before the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danois played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seven Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally stood at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, making it 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop to remember that we were going to Valderrama; we had a big breakthrough in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but just" said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 ranking to win the 5-3 win both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that it is not the end.
Go to the bottom of it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It didn't end until we got the points on the board.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Enjoying the performances of its players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never move on to this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that will be presented and it's all different.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, you have to get the best of yourself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these last day reversals, after having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Medinah Miracle," where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when going in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole journey," Bjorn said about his simple selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of the all-new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will have a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-navigation missiles, as well as some furtive technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the connecting ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, incessant delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the Maudite frigate F125 made the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it was delivered.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment on combat mission.
The defects in the software were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is heavily overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion at the outset.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval force is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The person responsible stated that the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their food quest.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams and the activities of different species.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of bats have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the perch and result in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as paper muzzles and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of pets.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their hunting night habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, perch and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only Scottish bat reserve on the site of Threave in Dumfries-et-Galloway, which houses eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and in other places will help us to better understand what bats need to prosper."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before carrying out the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without wishing to have a single maternity nest, 400 females and children can be killed, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about a lot of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations right now."
Ronaldo refutes the charges of rape while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "false information", and said that people "want to get known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375 000 to keep her quiet about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Speaking to its 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, called this information "false information".
“ No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They want to be public using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to prosecute Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a proportion to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Casino Hotel Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as it remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve as part of a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "forever regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "forever regret" if it had just lost its status as world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "affecting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on the possibility of an agreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles - has built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW reports that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers qualify as risks to Brexit's supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tenu flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on order.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be border disruptions which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages.
Toyota could not keep inventory more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "detailed precisely to avoid border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsovallaris, the coordinator of the United Union at the factory and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "My experience shows that once these jobs disappear, they never return."
A government spokesperson said, "We have proposed a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "repulsed by a week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia, and the possible impediments to the President's justice.
The question of whether Trump will or will not send the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors to Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would "do not prefer" to send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which they testified Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week inquiry into the complaints against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can relinquish another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press informed."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference at the Maison-Blanche.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of lectures was not due to an aversion to television "demagogic" reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they are stunning the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without mentioning any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We have checked the numbers."
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but "if the press is lucky enough to directly question the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and it will take the place of a press conference where you will be able to speak to the President of the United States."
Regularly, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare for him to do solo press conferences.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
With regard to Brexit's fears, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British Government has also stepped up its preparations for a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I feel about the contribution of each staff member, whatever his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee Tigers' Assistant, was urgently operated after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State Chief Coach, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before mid-term.
"He arrived on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a sieve and taking another exam.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said that there was "not yet any information on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plagues on a total of Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 plagues.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people in new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds of Sterling per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing to provide more affordable housing and target those earning high incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help homeless people.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and allocation purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds sterling per year.
About 13% of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and preventing first-ever accessors from taking a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "famous cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who stay most of the time outside the country.
This new policy occurs just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right to stamp in order to help more young people acquire a first home.
Instilling large construction companies in maintaining housing prices at a high level by taking over land without using it, she called on May to renounce quotas on affordable housing with the aim of settling the "real property loss" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including rent control and removal of "no faulty" evictions.
It also wishes to provide advice on broader powers for the construction of new housing.
May said, "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a house as it is for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of gaining access to the property has become far away and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scottish breeder at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is pleased to take up the challenge of rebirth of the North-East Club, which currently occupies third place in League 1, three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Premier League in Scotland last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up following the Scotch matches in Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would be only if I succeeded in managing the club."
The predecessors of Ross as selectionists of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician says he has not hesitated to line up behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to the First League?"
The structure and infrastructure of this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to do that, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I managed to bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as coach, after a period as assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Toloa climb from a third division relegation and transformed St Mirren, who was on the side of the relegation, into a big winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The management of Alloa "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really thought that being a coach would be better than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it well, that I earned my life well, and that I took advantage of some significant summits.
But playing is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I've been in my entire adult life."

According to a survey, the ideal time for a paint paint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer cannicle has raised incomes from British pubs in difficulty, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that the groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "England's permanent sunshine and longer participation in the World Cup led to July following the June model, where the bars had risen 2.8%, except for restaurants, which were even more shocked.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the catering sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are used are by far the most in vogue, with more points of resemblance than the lower restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered from effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and RSM, said: "These results have been following the trend since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors for out-of-home sales.
Not surprisingly, catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although sales decreased by 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot weather could not have been less opportune for food business operators, and time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the settlement.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, combined with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds Sterling and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that he hides from his parents.
According to one survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth of the "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a clean "main" account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "rap me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Head Missions Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the 11-18 year olds have a double profile, half of the students recognizing having private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that so many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I very much want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre test at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, where he won four gold medals and who is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after having undergone a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a hard job, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today I'm doing exercises of agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Online, an advertisement on the milk-throwing that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An on-line advertisement by a company offering a layer compares nursing mothers to cows at the time of trading.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "the world's first silent pull", Elvie, a public technology company, launched a bold publicity inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new pull-leit offers to breastfeeding women.
In a barn full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see tails" and "In case you wouldn't have noticed it, it's my breasts, it's not boobs."
The refractory continues: "I pump it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help the women bringing milk."
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are removed from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.

Another commented: "It is a comprehensible trauma to the mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a toothpick for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "A commercial so disconnected."
Others defended the advertisement, for example a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still sucking.
Pumper gave me the impression of being a cow.
The publicity's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It is a fun advertisement for mothers who draw their milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feels like "cows".
It's not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they danced with the discreet pull-ups concealed in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the trigger say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely silent, with no wires or pipes and is quietly inserted into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother commented: "The Elvie pull-out is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new dairy is going to provide.
This is not the first time that the Elvie puller is doing one of the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski as she used this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silent in a Texas border camp
The number of detained migrant children increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively stable, partly due to the Trump administration's severe speeches and policies making it difficult for children to place children in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves paperless immigrants and were afraid to compromise their own ability to stay in the country with the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that such data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no legal background.
"Nearly 80% of those who are respondents or members of their families are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people," said Mr. Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons found not eligible will be promptly expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports presented in recent months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the advocates of the rights of the child.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty in managing.
Syria calls on the U.S., French and Turkish "occupancy forces" to withdraw over the field.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged" both from the two terrorist groups and from any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which form and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground.
Moualem stated that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “promoting irrational concerns” that deter refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war was concluded.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last rebel fortress led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and hoped that the military measures would target jihadists, in particular the Nusra Front combatants, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, affirming that the work of the group should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and formulated a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers doubtless hope, he will be left prematurely, the removal and scandal will lead him to leave his presidency.
Which would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have practically tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during the big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something that we understand," commented Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC's drama series "Designed Survivor" that speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an accomplished comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, contrary to everything that happens on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most wealthy viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself looking for six hours at a panel of experts to discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his "Fear" book on Paul Manafort's $15,000 o'clock leather vest ("a dress filled with pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' extravagant descriptions of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If part of what he does gives the impression of seeing a tele-reality show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's changing teams and daily situation returns (fight the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you're out of line.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees in his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he was lying inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we animated all these crazy programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the tightest elections of half-mandate
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the electoral districts of Congress that allowed two incumbents to dispute the same seat.
This district of the suburb of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has landed his seat in another electoral district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured to another owner, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily run by the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district led to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major sectors of party financing, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCDC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice in March last at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States had considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, and then withdrew.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not object to.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the direction of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of US diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the Department, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions were only provided for Salvador, which received an estimated US aid of $140 million in 2017, especially to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa-targeted restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While internal meetings continued, representatives from North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now spoke at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American emissaries have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their remarks were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the story
The next tile could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his inquiry into the question of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack against our elections.
If Congress control changes hands, Mr. Trump will be in charge of accountability to this body, at the time he is about to stand before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many "if", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup d'etat against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable walk of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these divisions.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly record the President and has made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times' report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the recent investigation into the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confided to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we fail to succeed in these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, she sent me to light the sabbath candles on the Swastika table.
With this heritage as a legacy, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confiding in front of the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers will receive the Vienna Rapid Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify as Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation in the season until the nul 2:2 match against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game thinking about getting something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to win it at the end, but overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough match because they did a good result during their last match, nevertheless I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are having a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their retirement savings
Although participants in the survey knew clearly how they wanted to deal with them, few people referred to the issue with members of their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study reported talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% reported talking to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do what is necessary to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide you with care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost of care.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions on long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided that you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles on the way.
Provide a health care procurator that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake, but also the doctors?" Martin asked.

A man was injured several times with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man got several shots fired with a compressed-air gun while he was walking home from a party.
The victim, about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in the Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m. TSB, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance sheet should be heavy.
Since the communications were paralysed, the relief services could not receive any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that runs more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastlines to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, and particularly of the Donggala coastal region.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times since a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 victims on the Indian Ocean Coast, more than half of which occurred in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake reached south Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5- magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mintawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of over 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
No tsunamis were caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was summoned for suspicions of domestic violence, violating a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, as reported by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held in unsecured custody of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it's safe" when his plea was sought, announced the network.
Palin faces three class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with committing a minor class B offence, punishable by a prison day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are out of tune and the victim's record is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake was declared just off the center of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people met for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time of the tsunami on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York raider who has killed eight victims - a rare sentence that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, would have used a rented truck at Home Depot to attack a cycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to claim the capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the legal document.
A few weeks after this attack, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep preparation and premeditation," said prosecutors, describing the method used by Saipov as "hateful, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to a life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to have surrendered to acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years that followed the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to court records.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been prompted to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "of course disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party indicated that politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Rear-ban Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "had already been released" had Mr. Farage been secretary at Brexit.
But the dilemma faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to go out and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and "chaos".
Bone reported to the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He considered that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already been out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We did not deliver to world wars to submit to us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell journalists: "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our activists who walk the streets and make us elect first of all.
Give up Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises.”
"Mr. Farage told the assembly that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to mislead Brexit and we say to them today, "We will not let you get away with it."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I wish you would feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the People's Army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded banners of conservatives against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His Labour counterpart, Lord Adonis, mocked conservatives because of security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They assure us that they are in a position to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider presenting himself to the presidential elections.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice for President Donald Trump, presented for the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, the GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to introduce herself to the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman head of state."
Arrest at the time of the death of Sims of Louisiana State University
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of Basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Red Baton Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 AM. Press conference.
On Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot down on Friday morning near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to his head and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Interviewed, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody at the East Baton Rouge parish.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starting point last season, and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading for the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became obvious as soon as Valtteri Bottas qualified by devining Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and frowned Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the booths first and left Hamilton to embark on the torment at the peloton tail, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through the stands a bit later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver leave the interior at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to aim for a speeding arrival and move Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the booths at the 44th tower, but was not able to accelerate the pace in the eight remaining towers, Raikkonen clasped fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
During a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate these past few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they see the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose his story," Feinstein said to the committee, The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the gathering: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettyness, they stop knowing who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," the president said at Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased their Friday defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by taking the game back 5-3 to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants back.
François Bouchard egalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the stake four minutes later.
During a first busy period, Sullivan revived the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt served Cownie at 15:16, with equalization.
Dwyer secured the advance of the Giants before the first break when he struck his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered together and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen place Dundee in the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, ensuring victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes during their next match Friday.
An air traffic controller died by helping hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his position in the tower violently shaken at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt she was going down.
He passed away later in the hospital.
Yohannes Siria, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to grow because many bodies were still under debris and many could not be rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have ravaged Palu which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, Indonesian President, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
An aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man disappeared after the crash of an aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man has gone missing, after 47 passengers and crew have safely evacuated the plane that ran.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it was unable to track down a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft struck the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy stated that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the landing runway.
Witnesses felt that the aircraft had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the emergency exits of the plane were flowing.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors who worked close to improving a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the aircraft ran in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone calls from a mobile phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he had claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he had declared himself in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "were lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Telephone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing its music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins from political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black one?!
A New York nun continues a legal couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nun continues a court-married couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a message misled by her mother complaining that she was "still a Black".
The couple refutes to be racist, and assimilates prosecutions to an "extortion".
Lyssey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay in 2016, noting that Giselle Maurice, the new nun, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"NoOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE Une NOIRE", writes Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaffe, "bad to ease," Plasco-Flaxman referred Mme. Maurice, explaining to her that their former African-American nun had done a bad job and that she was looking for a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day of work, then sent home by an Uber.
Now Maurice continues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her dismissal and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she said in the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing not to be able to trust him after he was wronged.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco in the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to an "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the business banker.
While the file is still in progress, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very fun knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic in the face of the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication had a "sweet" taste after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a calm enough man, and he wasn't a pretentious one," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always given the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried everything to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to succeed," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly running out of his system.
She had died a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I could neither scream nor cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, went on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I experienced this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women mourn by laying postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel on a daily basis," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 and remaining in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he left his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I constantly fear that there will be a training effect."
Mrs Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people that you can go to and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not keep the silence - you must speak."
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He did not say that he felt shot down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had been a tremendous trauma to them, but they must get away with it: "It's tearing up for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI starts its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - we could perhaps bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "break down" in a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, on 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans achieve a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has presented its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to split the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: The number of "fall" deserters under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rise in power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator declared.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Department, stated that 127 desertions had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger tariffs were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of Northern deserters will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee from China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as clandestine migrants rather than as refugees and often as forcible returnees.
The relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of discussions focused on the denuclearization negotiations that remained pending.
This took place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broadest sense, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, charged US sanctions with the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to engage in unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", and claims that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help thinking that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh with emotion denied the allegations that he allegedly sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and choked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, qualifying the allegations concerning him as a " grotesque and coordinated assassination" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he is self-confidence with these statements and the way he took it from the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit in the court where he is currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's eventual decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh elected the question of the possible overthrow of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we were saying: "it's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You can think that I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
Tears are allowed as exuatory to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with an inexpressible rage, was that I had been caught by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always frightened me - who had led me to a staircase.
"Don't let them ever see you weep," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extra-marital case on board a vessel called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a maturely thoughtful decision," she confided to me in laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they lacked was one more person.
Someone called this "White-Neige and the Seven Nains."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had delayed fundraising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only about $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt surprised at it.
"You would have thought I was doing a nervous depression," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press's reaction to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first saves from the trade war between the United States and China have been horrifying, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week's largest increase was made with new US$200 billion worth of goods valued at £150 billion (£150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Every time, Beijing fought back in kind, recently hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on $60 billion in US goods.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second-largest world economy will soon waver.
It would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China, to turn back Washington, to give in to the demands, but publicly to give in to the United States.
However, the experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild that country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has recovered the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, plunged his kick into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of the four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current tournament format, the first of which dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was released 5 to 4 by the least well-placed player from the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 towards the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than I am.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," Garcia emotionally entrusted after the European victory.
He passed the flame to his fellow countryman John Ram who defeated the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm said, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, which has reached 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time all weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've abandoned.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to group together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bend.
We've gone overboard."
