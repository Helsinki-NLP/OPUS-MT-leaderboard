The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously staggering, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the subprefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared with the last elections in 2006 but loses 5.5%.
Even worse went to ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the post-war period and above all the literally catastrophic result of the populars, who provoked early elections.
Still at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the people had in preference to SPÖ a considerable advantage.
But voters have obviously punished them because they have caused the government to sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there have been speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that this could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the electoral result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FPÖ) have gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% of votes - but the socio-democratics have simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the populars to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 separated from the BZÖ) which has even been the cause of sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already said that he is ready to work with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously playing on this evolution.
In Parliament, the Green Party has also managed to enter, but has fallen slightly, going down among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who were accused of illegal collection of scarabs in India, it would happen according to Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it did not resolve, then there would be a certain cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly get into legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a superior instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made a similar statement during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can get into business is to lend the "competent legal support" to the convicted, the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that support of this kind is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been passed on for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said at ČTK, he pointed out in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the arrest and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained from the Indian side the promise to take care of it.
"I have achieved relatively many promises," he said.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is designed and the adjacent marine areas.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for ocean issues and maritime rights.
His boss, the Czech attorney director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and adds something every now and then.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal ore and other mineral materials, but also living organisms that have been unknown so far that they bring within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to pay interest to the undersea territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they use the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
The Convention provides for an exclusive right to all resources of the continental platform.
"In a nutshell, the continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea, often more than 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country submits to the Commission for the Definition of the Size of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and costly measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success in expanding its marine possessions has been a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear fruit in the future from the seabeds, how they promise will be invaluable.
Other countries will gradually submit their requests.
They can do this for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean bottom zone that the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins."
No state has an exclusive position here now.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Fondale marino is not Klondike," said the director Mikulka, "with the fact that his individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common "Interoceanmetal" organization.
It acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of so-called "prisoner investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is shattered, it's an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonian division Rober Sandev brings with him a exhibit to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
In the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages, we are getting more and more detailed information.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior participated in the rescue operation.
In addition to the army specialists were present on site GSG9 units, the avian federal police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistic experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesman for the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans to join them as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there fortunately," says a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19th in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freed in the meantime have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not explain the details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should fly off with an Airbus military aircraft and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
American House of Representation rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 entries around 227 the American representative house rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been distorted.
In a dramatic action the supporters have desperately tried to persuade the critics from the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged the MPs to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to be grateful to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was ongoing, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the blessing of both the Chamber of Members and the Senate.
Promoters record figures in increases in bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study the turnover on travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of the situation the desire to travel from Germans to an investigation remains solid.
On the winter season reservations the travel agencies recorded an increase of 31 % in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for tourism DRV told Berlin Monday .
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute there are booking quotas also increased for the autumn months.
So the travel agency surplus for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Budgeted for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the whole market.
Also included would be travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, in particular the travel to the United States would be required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
In addition, special travel destinations would be requested from the Germans, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all inclusive trips have a high quotation, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "more calculateable for customers than for an organized holiday individually".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, explained Laepple.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent reservation figures, so much so that compared to the year before it would have reregistered an excess of turnover - although according to one further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits by Ballermann, one litre and vip canopy beer in Dirdln.
A Wiesn debut
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom made Dirdl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
One thing, however, unites us: just 3 minutes to Wiesn, already the photographers shoot against us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The Dirdl for two money seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident to the north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress until today still remains within the limits.
And once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirdl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirdl's apron collects strange glances at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun makes me note that I would have hooked the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, on the center six virgins, on the right you are busy, behind the widow."
I'm simply going to fix the bow from the back to the left.
All right," she says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which it caps "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a ragged "ooooo".
This tells me, after she got rid of her beer mouth from a litre she drank earlier.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, all of whom think she's a snitch.
Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m. they walk in white on the piazzale of the feast the sanitaries, who must take care of the poor beons
The nurses appear every time in white – always 4 at the same time drag a curtain-covered stretcher into a tent.
This works as with most visitors of the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the roof in this blood alcohol bar, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer pack," yells at me one of the sanitaries and disappears into the shed.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on a misguided driving charge.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is extending diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate the Turkish hinterland in depth.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renascimental style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some provincial German municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling to the ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most westward passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railroad running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
British and Dominant Forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a train of ammunition broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone into discontent, largely overcome by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
There is now a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the carriage bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a slippery race along the slopes that produced the old world sequences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a century-old state intended to turn its back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by commercial centers means built and pastries of power, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the foreign political party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," she tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of either.
They must be both.
"But surely at a certain point, "I ask, " will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkish," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited in memory: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as much as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically go through those railway lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should advance claims on this charming country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologio, September 11) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/ under the age of 21, but at the time when Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything that music had to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the stick was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial nor flowered.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If one were to appoint a conductor as knight, it would be Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "falled around the world one or two well-known battle horses."
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"Recommending the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength that they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda Supersellers
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
A refined mechanics must be added to everything, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of London Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model in Europe is less well known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will make it possible to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which accounted for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain in good measure.
In fact, the managers of the company plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, Japanese society expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the length is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, it also expands the living interior.
This advantage derives from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
Moreover, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with double background - rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measures of the 1.4 engine version, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - relate to an improvement in the accessibility of the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in the models with gasoline engine of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include the i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time maintain high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now have 100 horses.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieves a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
"Ape Car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
Japanese society has created a robot that, for example, by taking the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Safety Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles of the manufacturing house.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle over 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption into its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they have defined as a laser location(Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right or higher angles to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer in charge of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, and not even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which they can turn their wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act starting from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, for this it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, or even mega."
This is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination avoiding the obstacles present in the path.
Freak before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as owning many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging with scrapping loans in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel de badi crediti"...or problems.
The secret aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce thinking not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do that, which is probably the primary objective.
Of course the information the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the vast public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house isn't even talking...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a stake of 21% in the Company, news received as a result of a net decrease in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
A week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would have purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The price established is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per share, which is a percentage below its current 28% course.
Around 5 p.m. Morgan Stanley, however, dropped from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, General Manager of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than the one taken earlier.
The modalities defined Monday also show that in the last few days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno , executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation in the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the diluted equity."
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, over a given period, they are exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow her to seize investment opportunities, strengthen her budget and increase her liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan pointed out that she "clearly" eased its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to hard test, which has seen half the value of its shares half while the cost of risk insurance has suffered an impennate.
However, the cost of Monday's work remained at a high level of around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "superstitious" between Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed and Merrill Lynch's detection, announced that he had collected 15 billion dollars, partly at the Berkshire Hathaway, group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Found the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, of the Bolivian Evo Morales et of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission carried out since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should obtain half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously," it had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently from their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to renew its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the free provision of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of a Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commandant launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, healthy and saved, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commandant.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15-30, on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interview to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom "to the kidnappers" has been paid, said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna on the landing track.
Rapided on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been stashed from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organization agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the manager who requested to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would have supported the German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were on and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), which the latter immediately denied.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the front page, a debate on the financing of culture focuses on the current election campaign.
So much the better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in shadow.
Who will pronounce himself to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that starve?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution to state that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this in common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical heritage, archives and heritage assets, preserve with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states, through partial nationalisation, help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank, which was first in trouble in Europe for the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest even in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level on the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can constitute a precedent.
According to the decision taken Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share present in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then presented themselves in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares on Friday fell almost 12%, the lowest point since 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the group's entire capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's managers this value is not real.
The company summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares for the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the 700 billion dollar American plan.
Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has submitted with a meritable offer.
The Belgian Government had already ensured that investors should not be afraid to lose their money.
The bank's clients did not panic, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of personal data on the purchase of medicinal products.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program that the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies are subject to the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims to the health status of the customer and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not enter the insurance.
Time ago the client had to go on a medical visit and the contract was only concluded after the outcome of the exam.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the client's identification code you can easily get information from the pharmacies on which medicine you purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program evidence of what diseases you suffer and in what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is practically incorruptably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not remain much in addition to paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
In contrast, some medicines can be used for more than one purpose, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is worth as a risk increase factor, the first two are not.
In order to request and process data, companies have formed apart and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities now oblige them to do so even if they have not yet imposed any fines on negligence.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients' state of health.
More and more companies have access to the data and at the same time the control of the use will be more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to the specialized enterprises in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
Then at the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Mariglia menu
European Union and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners that primarily trade each other, the agenda for the ninth summit was dominated by this issue, in addition to all the other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more should be voiced in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this in the ninth summit organized yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in his capacity as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have legally unified, so air traffic can also take the lead in the future.
India by the end of 2009 would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only a ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted attention to global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter, condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, that is, it wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be made at the next year's climate conference and a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas production by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy in a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors, French firms will receive a 20 billion euro charge.
According to information from our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Under Secretary to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
He will follow the press meeting at Room Struktur in Buchmesse Hall 5.0: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data progressively decreases the weight of the books of foreign author on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and boys.
Steve Fossett's plane was found missing billionaire a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert.
The scraps were found at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff has therefore specified that no human remains have been found in the plane, nor in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) informed that a few hours after the relic was sighted, a team of investigators was sent, who then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the tour of the world on an aeronautical balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he made the world a plane without a stop.
Among its many records, also the one of flying at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect.
A Suv out of patterns with an original design and well defined by firm lines, large surfaces and net corners.
This is, in short, the latest born Glk among the "compact" offerings of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of novelty in this sector.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, will be unexpected and not conventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
So the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unpublished mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D affission campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi-ffission project, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the very central Via dello shopping Milanese, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture you'll get the impression that the car comes out of the manifesto.
Later, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then restored to a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stifle the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans
From Trivenetus, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Blue National for years and that until now, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing typhus.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added groups (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colour flags where the militants' home cities appear: Saturday night they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoseria.
In Bulgaria they found a true Nazi puppetry, that of Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets for the game available to Italian fans: all nominal, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had controlled them all: among those parties for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had prior stage crimes, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then he will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who were arrested or who was identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents us from attending not only the Italian stages but throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, won't be setting foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank you.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, there are added others.
"We must immediately turn off this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they argue from the Viminale.
So, "good eyes opened above all in view of the game of the National of Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is in fact a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Cassms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is of the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems from stage.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the tight arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is what Domenico Mazzilli's (very unhappily expressed) thought, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the premier of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to drown in the Duce but of course the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist - he adds n.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the event takes place.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see well what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about fishes in Mameli's anthem: even those are not crimes, but if you allow me, I am not an education...".
