The members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "marionettes"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, namely to call them the MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Galician Parliament.
Members of the Wales National Assembly present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that they "remain with Twp and Pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: in Welsh, “twp” means “obtuz” and “pwp” means “faecal matter”.
A member of the Wales Party of the Wales National Assembly said that, overall, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group has a "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that it also noted that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on even the members of the Assembly."
The 2017 Wales Government Act provided the Assembly with the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which have shown that many of them want to use "the Wales Parliament".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred “Members of the Parliament of Wales” or “WMP”, but the “MWP” option received the most votes during the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of the Wales have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes over a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee's system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word regarding their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of name of the country
On this Sunday, citizens with voting rights will express their opinion on the change in their country's name in the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote has been organised to resolve an old dispute for decades with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he will not take this vote into consideration.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of the episcopal church of St. Martin stopped beating as a result of the problems faced by the churches in Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I talked to told me that before, you were finding a bar and a church in every corner of the street,” Adams said.
"Today there are no bars or churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather."
And as far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect, and that, " sooner or later, the outcome will be the same."
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condos full of people who would not support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will speed up the closure of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move in these condominiums will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African Americans – the Metropolitan Community of St. Martin in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who were conducting their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by a congregation of Afro-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted traders on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but the enorians of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it and included carion in it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to the church of St. Martin, called the carion "clopots of poor people".
The expert who put carion into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument of non-placement".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that he was the first carion in the world operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to a larger carion at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by deacons of the church, others by Episcopal diocese.
Sacristy, the parish governing entity, made up of deacons, wrote to them the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "was looking to pass costs" to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enorians complained of the lack of transparency that he showed the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy who was trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 in the morning, near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the San Diego station KSWB-TV that he was swimming for about half an hour, along with his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that initially he thought the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to come out of the water, "There's a shark in the water," Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that represents a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
Authorities restricted access from Ponto Beach from Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position on the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, providing beams with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of a position on the UK beauty products market, worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not tailored, the higher radiuses with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year, if they prove to be a success.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of supermarkets seeking a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of the Sainsbury retailer said that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essee, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to Boots Stores.
The supermarket also revives its range of make-up products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, an increasing demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two shops of the Sainsbury chain for testing purposes, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury retailer, said the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to deal with the fight with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which provide more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from Outlet Argos in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profit.
Previous attempt of the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ended after a divergence in the way Boots stores’ income was divided into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, Celesio company, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury retailer, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our beams with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to acquire beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
TV protagonist "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth £11 million with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household objects.
The couple's company was compared with the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presentation of the 37-year-old "This Morning" broadcast announced on Instagram that it will withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" issue, retreating at the last moment from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved television people admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that his new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, would no longer allow him to dedicate himself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household objects.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune with an estimated 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, 37-year-old, announced on Instagram that he would quit the contract for Truly, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source statement: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
Nobody was gonna believe what happened on Tuesday, but it was a little bit until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presentation of "This Morning", which is among the best-selling stars in Britain, could bring the company to the detriment of millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible additional delay in launching.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host to the I'm A Celebrity ITV broadcast.
A nearby source of Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business."
I was really tough, and then "I fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he'd get from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "nomial by a president" and that he had such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice of "newsman" .
"I didn't take a step back."
He said that Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not notice an “response” from the United States on the earlier disarmament steps of North Korea.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic point of view in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well for North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I behaved like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to get into this stubborn arena, there would be about 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their aid is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for initiating international aid actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about the fact that I am not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the "Save Children" Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia, it is unthinkable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often found on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a warning mermaid in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship that has stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of Indonesia's precarious infrastructure be the central point of his electoral campaign and has made money for roads and railways with great care.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate next year in a new electoral campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sects, as most Muslim members have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes, because gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, using machetes, arches and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea, with a goal in 89th, Saturday, on the London Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it was about 30 metres from the front gate of the opposing team, and his team was led by Chelsea with 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a kick in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached above which, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed from Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as far as possible, so I tried to get as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just took the ball forward."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in minute 25.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic and then returned to the middle of the field and ran towards the half-field of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered into it.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball to the net, succeeding in hitting it with his left foot and passing by the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Napoli team in the Champions League groups on Wednesday, 15:00, at São Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the National Disaster Agency, in the morning of Sunday.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters, said the agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman by stabbing
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m., with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and was arrested by a man suspected of murder.
The police asked people in the area who heard or saw something about this matter to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stage, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the onboard camera to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, at the crime scene, some people came who think I know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police said they're trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few more hours until they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
Repeat continuously "it's so awful!".
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and another one was outside of it.
A few police officers were on the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person who has information is asked to send a message directly to the police @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at telephone 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the altercations on "rescription of history"
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritan descendants.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues as the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and commemorated."
A pig has caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the family name "Yuan", was found dead after being sectioned into an artery and was covered in blood, near a pig farm in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he had come with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby elbow was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth in the cot.
The coroners confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and nipple," the cousin said, whose last name is "Wu," for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs have been reported attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
“It’s simple and simple to play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost his strength, will cause torential rain in the southwest of the United States
As expected, hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions with a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1 hurricane, Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressive area has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, he will begin to push intense tropical humidity from north to south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the pressure zone will generate abundant rain in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitation between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls between 5 and 10 cm are expected on the south-west side, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid floods may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of rain.
It is not recommended that you venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by rain.
The strong rain could cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The nearby depressive zone will bring torrential rains to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Rainfalls of nearly 2 cm are possible, which could lead to minor flows of waste and slippery roads.
These will be the first precipitation in the region in the wet season.
Spreading tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of the month, before rain spreads more Monday and Tuesday.
The intense precipitation will spread in the so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperature will be recorded in the US, because the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic differences in temperature are encountered in the U.S. central area.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and extend again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern part of the US will face a warm October beginning, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from southern fields to certain parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the east of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the supreme court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault on which it was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a final news: an agreement reached between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an investigation into allegations for a week.
Ford told the judge that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was in a state of drunkenness and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said that it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems contorting people who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was second-place, with 3,26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was tracked by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while the protestors were shouting at him and he was trying to get up in an elevator to a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He stared down for a few minutes while people were arguing, and everything was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the closure of the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
The televisions then broadcast the live vote in the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he'd do this only if the FBI agreed to examine the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by minority democrats.
Flake was convinced, in large part, of his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, being obviously the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses "Political Games" Critics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, participated in the conference of the Conservative Party of Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect their mutual tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims' shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in case of Wayde Sims' death, the 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20-year-old, was arrested and imprisoned, charged with a 2nd-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities published the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he admitted that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medicine Bureau Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a headshot through the neck.
The department grants the Louisiana police force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of that area for the aid provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
Athletic director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligence and seeking justice".
Sims was 20.
The 1,98-meter-high attacker grew in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was “devastated” and “sucked” by Wayde’s death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a ash column over Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors more whispers and vibrations.
The pictures on social networks presented thin layers of ashes on the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimillco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km from the southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Chancing between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters fought with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote, gathering thousands of protestors against it.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from the gendarmes bombed them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The charging was intensified later, the police using their canes to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive", while the union protestors shouted "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose, in a overwhelming majority, to become independent, although the vote was low, and those against the secession boycotted, in large part, the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, resulting in violent charges.
The pro-independence groups camped overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I’ve lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I've looked at my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we don't have anything to do," he said.
Despite a vital but tight victory, in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain the mood this year, many of the most known leaders finding themselves either in their own exile or in detention, awaiting trial for the role they played in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison at the end of last year, announced that he will be running for elections for the next year's European Parliament.
"As a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression into democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after they drove into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. in Ballinagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the port and even the building.
Looks like at some point a gun was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unresponsive, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains without a win in the Premier League this season and faces Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division up to six matches, Holt's principal coach still feeling the taste of defeat, because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and try to sneak into the gate, then Alan Lithgow managed to sneak wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could trouble visitors at the free hits.
And that was the way the crucial gap came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to care for Menga, who screamed and scored from the center of which.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and Liam Kelly's porter was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This model game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow gave a big hit from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to come to the team of Livingston, but without success, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett had brutalized Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Honomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on stage Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending trajectory.
Their game style and team have not changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took her over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the whole party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The bare steps were missed, they only managed once to catch the door of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions on Erdogan's visit to Köln
It was all pink Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy the relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, from outside Turkey.
Police called for security reasons to prevent the gathering of a lot of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but there were enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, the majority of Kurds, have voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
Protests in contradiction reflect division over a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies from collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded Deptford street in the southeast of the city around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs only a few months after another biker died following an accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile away from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of buses is diverted and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded officers following a charges
Six prison officers were injured following a felony at a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, a fight broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m., which was ongoing.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the fighting, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries in the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison staff was requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison needed hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, officers dealing with disorders were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by the Rosa hurricane (the dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
Tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwest desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct journey to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of the month it will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a Twitter message that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of approximately 320 km from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action approximately 60 km away from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the Uragane National Centre predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas the torrential rain will be beneficial because the southwest is facing drought problems.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona faces at least one severe drought and the second largest category", information found onweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north, with 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Mexico's torrential rains could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
"Torential rains between 8 and 10 cm are expected" from Baja California to north-west Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm", according toweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain of Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States," said a representative of the Uragane National Centre.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams into the deserts as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested due to a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with wounds caused by stabbing in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 p.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-olds were arrested last night in Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers asked for help from citizens who could have materials on their mobile phone, or to come to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh faced "unfortunateness and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims regarding sexual harassment ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage" that day.
"A confirmation vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he told the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the republican presence in the intermediate elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express my positive opinion about the candidates I think are great."
Trump argued that democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place no later than Friday, a GOP assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, with the number growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and a tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at the mulberry, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with magnitude 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency at a Jakarta press conference.
"The tsunami itself brought cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled across the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunamis and survive.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos published by the disaster agency present several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the lines continued to shake the city on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy emitted by the strong Friday earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
Probably the geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf, has intensified the tsunami, added its representative.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, he also said, along with the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely disrupted without any information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There more than 300,000 people live," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
On Saturday, the Agency was harshly criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the people evacuated still need food and other basics.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Word Vision staff at Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the court of the office, they passed near devastating scenes, said Doseba.
He added: "They told me they saw many houses destroyed."
The situation is very serious.
Even if the aid groups started to start aid actions in the event of disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, financial resources, delivery of materials and personnel can only reach the place of production of a calamity if the area of national disaster is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the disappeared hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who had been in ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national parapant team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing parapant pilots.
Other people captured at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told about how, a few hours after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the parapanta sports practitioners community, he sent desperate messages to WhatsApp to Palu contestants who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But according to his messages there was only one gray steak, and not two blue steaks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been sent," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport on the Levee ATM
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, said Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "run behind employee Brink" and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport police at telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He made the announcement on Saturday about the change on Twitter: “the officially known individual Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he expects to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for reasons of emotional nature", said the producer of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is most often spoken in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, in the discussion of the title of the Big Boy radio host album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it came to "Ye", being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more of a reflection on what we are as people."
He's one of several rappers who chose to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes cramped, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
Mexico President Promises Not to Use Military Forces Against Civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, along with the approaching 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing movement of students was rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends for research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after more members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though in the U.S. there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be the first place in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in AI would be made in the U.S., Lee said for CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, which was the best in the field at the time, and later he was the executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency of Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the next visions.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China puts sticks in wheels to academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. to step up its efforts in AI.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China National Natural Sciences Foundation provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence in the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, for the purpose of involving the partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
Also, at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes in United States legislation aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute over a decade with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slav population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign has cast doubt as to the presence at the vote, with the possibility that the minimum limit of 50%, necessary for the validation of the referendum, will not be reached.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the break-up of Yugoslavia, so that it can be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia will live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79-year-old, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite many members of parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state electoral commission stated that no irregularities were reported by 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the people with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, a voter from Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small-sized scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with their foreheads up, not the back door," Kavarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that most will be in favour of the name change, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a result in favor of the name change would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-vestic government policy since the government took over in May of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the entire Brighton team's defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to get past Brighton's defense and get Saturday the Manchester City team victory with 2-0 on Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in minute 65.
The Argentine attacker got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
It moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to get past a defender, and then overtaken more of the adversaries at the edge of that Brighton team.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, succeeding in avoiding the porter from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a kick to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces a few foot problems," said reporters Pep Guardiola, Manchester City team manager.
"We talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a left flank.
Sane tripped the balloon several times until she sent a pass to Sterling, who sent her in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the balloon to the net just before heading off the ground.
Manchester City will face on Tuesday at 12:55, with Hoffenheim in the group phase, on the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still play-off implications for Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but according to the sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game with number 34, had a heating session Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The D.C. Mijlocau has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 matches in this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the decision-making by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the republican presence in the intermediate elections.
“Our whole effort is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, which is why I'm trying very hard to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of democrats, see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to take over power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, describing democrats as "furious and evil, naughty and lying."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein from the Democratic Party and who is a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, which was heavily overrun by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
Persons expressing their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censor motion as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, has received similar treatment because she was stubborn about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was critical of my address because I disagreed with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues ironically, concerning which neither Jeremy had common views with previous leaders.
The Notice for Friday's meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentioned that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the Friday-night GC meetings were like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, milder" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the leadership of the party.
Things began to be like this since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some of my colleagues with whom I had a common vision in terms of politics began to expect to change my thinking and to agree with some things that I had not previously agreed with, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, I follow a wave of abuse on social networks that call for my elimination from the party, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who's dealing with this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion of censorship or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes less and less flexible in this respect.
Many people have recommended that I put my head down in the last two years, not to be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like this.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party, 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence shown by the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who have the greatest need for them, as local advisor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that I am unclear about politics and the issues I do not agree with in relation to the current leadership.
People who supported the motion on Friday, I can only tell them that, in the context of the country heading for Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Nottingham Momentum Group, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches top rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts have somehow influenced the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive match today from Tennent's Premiership.
It is now at the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, everything has been summed up in their better defense, as well as in the fact that they have taken more advantage of the opportunities that have emerged, which has helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to several tests during our games until now and we continue to be undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The merits are given to the Ayr team, they have taken more chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a yellow cartoonist received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unprocessed test.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to score, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second time very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, which was pulled out of the field with the plate, and since the game began, Ayr was released through the attempt of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
The captain of the Ayr team, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cardboard and again, Melrose team made the spare player pay with an unprocessed trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard because he placed Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the attempt, as did it again close to the game's restart, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent Gregor Henry extreme deep for the fifth host team's attempt.
The view of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in his beloved BBC show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-time partner, actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the new series, would be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in "the restaurant development industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval siege full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in the last decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary sense, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on the large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a decision in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of strong discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial struggle for the rebirth of next year – also has much to gain from the month decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivar, and that it would change too few things if it happened.
The UN body in Holland has no power to grant territory belonging to Chile and has stipulated that it will not result in possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final pleadings were heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years might have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to speak after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never renounce the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go past the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri talked about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to abide by its promises made during a Singapore summit with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context of the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to restart diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months of the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong One.
Ri said it is an "irreal view" that the sanctions continue and the objection of the United States with regard to the declaration on the end of the Korean war to ever make the territory of the north to yield.
Washington has reluctance to agree with the statement without the Phenian first taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that the Phenian has serious intentions to abandon the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends regarding hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to extend your collection or to protect you completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked the participants in the Week of Paris, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring and summer 2019 collection.
The practical hats won the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion makers sent out the creations that steal their eyes on the podium.
The creation resistance piece, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, beige-colored hat, with a large bor, like a feather, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories have included peppers adorned with marbles, a hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and not high- Couture fashion.
One of the creations seemed to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dress style, with oversized clothing items, you're lucky.
Stilists predict a return of huge bonets in luxury fashion stores.
Oversized hats come back after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat, the straw hat with a wide boar, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and up to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat at all practical that appeared on all socialization networks has caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely of straw for the beach, with a size just as large as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
Orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-winter 2019 collection "La Riviera" by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, said for FEMAIL: "I expect to see oversized beach hats and bags in luxury stores in the following summer, because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people in other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a High Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a matter, are kept the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for the fight against job vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills increasingly become imperative for young people to prepare for their future career.
With multiple job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such an ability throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investment in foreign language learning is important for today's children.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have greater chances of finding significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look in perspective until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more choice languages in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that specialize in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to succeed, however the future would be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it (must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James as they debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening of the Sunday press against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains to settle.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers six games program in the press.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare myself," he said.
Time of Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five events scheduled for the following week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote of confirmation for the candidate chosen by him for his place of office at the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wishes to strengthen support for future elections in the middle of the term, because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I watch him online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., East Coast time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's online election rally in West Virginia via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense due to inappropriate sexual behaviour charges, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so that the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win a little bit of land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the role of these five events next week is "energizing volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important for its program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season,” Reuters said a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented on the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the election at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is headed into the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple evidence starting on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it's possible that Saturday afternoon ant test might have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The motivating pendulum is always an invented concept for the sports world, but the players really believe in it, all the more in the case of competitions like this.
So, where's their motivation now?
"They led us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this decrease for a bit of motivation," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game starts to change in their favor and that there are plenty of encouraging reasons, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent balls to the green area with lethal precision, an example for his colleagues.
Those holiday gourds became more and more noisy as the advance ran, especially when they entered a crucial point in bringing the score back to equal in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The strike that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about just your own game," Spieth says.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange couple, but adorable, of Europe won four out of four games and apparently can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not need any additional blows Saturday afternoon, but this claim is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine Friday morning points.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would end up a potential victory of Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Discussions on the glory of the Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed by Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the football challenge, when he paired with Alex Noren.
One extra hit and two doubles at the first nine holes sank Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they weren't even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Furball and fork samples are fascinating and deserve close attention due to interactions between pairs, data and data tips and the way a strategy can be changed on the spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this session of ants has also shown that the US team is motivated to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing the games of fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
Inspired by the pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of an hesitant Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes in the morning football challenge and won the 3 to 1 series.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the forsome challenge, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair who win four points from the four opening matches throughout the history of Ryder Cup.
After they crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the furballs trial, they were brilliantly supported to defeat the discouraged Woods and the American Bryson Dechambaau novices with even a clear score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday matches, had occasional genius sparks, but so far lost 19 of the 29 fourball and foursome games, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning football session, returned with his partner Henrik Stenson in the forsome challenge and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a journey without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win by 2-1 a match disputed against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball challenge, then returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in the four-piece challenge after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup managed a team to recover a deficit of four points in simple evidence, though, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there's no "no chance" to unilateralize as long as there's no trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that extending sanctions will deepen confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for its country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the Global Council that in North Korea "significant measures have been implemented to prove their good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate answers from the US," he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can't unilaterally disarm the first."
Although Ri resumed North Korea's family objections to Washington's opposite resistance to a "sampled" approach to nuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it made gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral nuclearisation, as did the Phenian in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US-owned president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed himself to making progress towards a “denoclearity of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump provided guarantees on North Korea’s security.
North Korea looked for an official final of the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States said the Phenian must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not take the form of requests for the relaxation of harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the "first denuclearisation" option and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, but it even objects to the "war closing declaration", Ri.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel to us is an illusion that only people who do not know us have.
But the problem is that the prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader in the United Nations referred to earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea's president, in the last five months, adding: "If the problem of nuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Malificent President" Trump called Kim a "man-racket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said that work is barely started and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no planned time for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday for the UN Security Council: “The application of sanctions to the Security Council must continue vigorously and without interruption until we obtain complete, final and confirmed nuclearisation.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for nuclear programs and those on Phenian ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri in the colors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea denounced the fact that he made "gangster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "proper measures".
He said Kim told him that the "proper measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing "macho" culture that causes them to undergo "all night" learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that the students of the most prestigious universities in the world often don't even master the basic concepts of the way they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this guy in the US.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
"At the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this just now, in the last year?"
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a room, and students can click on coffee pots, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
"We know we can't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czesler.
Culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night yet exists, says this, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said this, indeed even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a course after participating in one of his first year courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to be asked by all post-university students to complete a similar study program before joining this institution where the competition is bitter.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of "blue aluminum" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerrard's team
Rangers is suffering from another case of devolving depression because Dolly Menga's hit condemned Steven Gerrard's inconvenient team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Ibrox wanted to get first win in travel from the 4-1 triumph against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to administer Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers players didn't seem at any time able to match.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed third place, behind Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could also face other problems, because the Calum Spence tortoise had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the fan lawn of the visiting team.
Gerrard switched eight players from the lot who won easily against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players at Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot choked his opponents during the game.
Even if Rangers had a higher possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step had propelled Scott Pittman to the defensed gate of Allan McGregor, but the middleman missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her near the bar.
Rangers took over, but left the impression that they hoped more than they trusted in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he met Steven Lawless in the fiftieth minute of the game, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demand.
Rangers only managed two hits on the front gate, but former Ibrox porter Liam Kelly wasn't bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the goal of the 34 minutes of Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, either for the effort laid down.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep focus of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, who kept his calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple blow.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave immediate fruit, when extreme centered Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out of the barrels to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the exact same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting the center after the center.
Holt's team could have expanded the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' blow, then Lithgow sent head on next to the corner.
Glenn Middleton, spare at Rangers, demanded a penalty at the end of the game when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.

And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the numbering CONTINUES...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as it happened in the film "Clopotele de San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the role of cowboys with improbable inclinations to science:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these boxes, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, there's a lot of punches!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine learns the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory.
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then be reinjected.
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal ones, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a Trump's support diatribe while wearing a MAGA cap after the appearance of the SNL.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was hurled into the studio during the Saturday Night Live broadcast after an unfortunate show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist broke out in a speech against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's diatribe footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get over the West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had backstage problems because of his six-year-old.
“They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I was assaulted!
They also told me that I got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see how low I got?”, then said that “I’m going to catch my Superman mantle, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted the public at least twice, and SNL team members seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on this team said to the publication: "In the studio there was a complete silence."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he played the song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the conservative group leader TRUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you for having faced the world.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") I think he embraces and expresses an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that he is now “the officially known son of Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name; West steps in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then "the artist previously known as Prince".
Charge of attempted murder for a stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defense lawyer is expected to stand before the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star in the Throne Urzeala, attacks toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy Throne Urzeal, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that it seems to him that "something wrong" has happened and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity can be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Throne Urzeal, Rose Leslie, who is still 31 years old, admitted that he is “very determined” to talk about this issue.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where have I wronged with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be like adults, given the problem we're facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What does young boys learn from TV and the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our times: how can we change this?
Because it is clear that something wrong with young people has happened."
In the interview, he acknowledged that he will not play in any way the series based on the Throne Urzeal after the series ends next summer, saying that "he has finished with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West theatre by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a villain.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the Throne Urzeal series is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this series, so it assured me of the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy Awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, the officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly to areas in China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, saying Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered to be very widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theorists"
The representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his team posted personal information on three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the accusations were made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Minds, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information disclosed included the personal addresses and phone numbers of senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on inappropriate sexual behaviour charges against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed judge at the Supreme Court.
The information leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temper necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
He must not question the defendant's motivation.
You must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office warned “the appropriate authorities and legal entities regarding these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they will answer to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English strikes again: the unflinching parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson as the lead
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexitului in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new series of parish films of action that has Johnny English as the main character, the series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Will this glittering satire of how strange we are to become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with staring eyes and rubber face, was renewed for the second time his license to ruin everything. The name of the character signifies, first of all, that it is a comedian general creation for the cinematographic audience of the non-bodily English countries.
He is, of course, the secret shrunken agent who, despite his luxury and extravagant claims, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop by Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that kind who contributed with a single note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two cute moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor's hats easily hit his helmet.
The gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as those in series 007 or Impossible Mission, offer with confidence comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address more children than adults and, for me, the thrilling adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent movie gangs when playing Bean.
As usual, the premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy web network and revealed the identities of undercover English agents, to the despair of the service agent, a pitiful little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister pompous and under siege, who already suffers a severe crisis due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his character like Theresa May, but the script does not give him a chance to shine.
His intelligence advisor informs her that all active spies have been compromised, so they have to activate a registrar.
This is Johnny English's own whiz, now working as a teacher in a high-class school, which also teaches about how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute gadgets, because English leads a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of the creation of the misguided in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technological industry claiming that he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the disaster Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in a odyssey of burlestian adventures: dress in waiters, set fire to a French-style restaurant, create chaos when sneaking on board Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize itself with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but as much as the cute and colorful film seems to be a television production for children.
Pretty mediocre movie.
Like other films with Johnny English, I can't stop wondering: can't even the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to his talent?
Workers deny that they plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the company's bosses to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) by giving the employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say that the idea would be "contraverse" to the party's economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of workers.
The four-day shift to work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the leadership of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen by night, but a four-day working week is a proper aspiration to approach the party to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the overall industry strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is determined to take back the power from "frontless managers" and "profits" from utility companies.
The plans of the Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supplying regions might not fully recover their actions, because the Labour government could perceive "deductions" due to established crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers in the company's management boards and to create ownership funds by giving 10% of the private sector's equity to employees, which will receive annual dividends of up to around 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the show "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed his final vote on his candidate as a judge in the Supreme Court at least a week ago and raised the question whether Republican senators could be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI's findings.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I said that from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, promptly, without equivocal. "
Graham's vote, however, seems dug in the stone.
“I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so he would need some explosive charges,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejects the charges decisively," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons referred to therein have confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something will change."
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
Up to the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help increase awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what success did the Global Citizen's Festival have when there are only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism, a concept that refers to people who feel that they have achieved something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have driven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, on account of which at least 10 billion dollars were already spent or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with UK-based investors and intermediaries who have committed to "help children grow up to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwandese $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of Britain's government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition only become a footnote in the book of history," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements for civil or anti-apartheid rights that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will play at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces for a "blocking" that hinders Russian energy exports, says the Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, "if necessary," call on naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I am in the Middle East is that I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go out on the market," he said.
Zinke addresses participants to an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that says "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that "they know one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 gas pipeline's "undecided" project, which, Trump said, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of Nord Stream 2, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin stated that the US's fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we're looking at things the same way: energy cannot be a pressure instrument and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industries in Germany (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state intervening in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run for the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that he must "think seriously" if he is to run for presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our bad governance, and that's why there's a need for a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"On 6 November, I'll think seriously if I run for the presidential election."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during his meeting at the city hall, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other names of some well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Senator of Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers from at a Donald Trump rally.
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence
“The things that my own son goes through, through which he has passed after he has returned... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the wounds that our soldiers are returning to,” said Donald Trump's support rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little differently, harder, wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers from the armed and air forces, as well as all other members of the Army, have done for the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and holding a gun in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who try to escape the violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District completed a friendly curiae request in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum-seeking policy, reports NBC News.
The complainant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not revealed.
This said that her partner "and her violent sons, members of a gang," abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a widespread problem with domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum policy cancelled a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council that allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” writes the amicus curiae application.
In addition, lawyers argue in the request that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to “supply the necessary workforce”.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June judges to stop providing asylum to victims who are trying to escape the abuse and violence of the gangs.
"Azile is granted to those who leave the country driven by persecution or fear because of racial discrimination, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or because of a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum was never to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a timer race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become worse and worse.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who aligns her baby suffering from fever to an evacuation center in the city destroyed Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale, were overtaken by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replicas.
It has teary eyes when it remembers how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador Accuses China to "abuse" propaganda claims
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page commercial in a U.S. daily in which it praises the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the supplement China paid in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to mix in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, involving surges in import tariffs.
China's tariffs as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts in China and the US.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"When spreading propaganda by publishing a commercial in Des Moines Register, China's government does not respect the priceless tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," says Branstad.
"Instead, at the newspaper stand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices from dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what the paper is about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warn analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned that there will be a counter-reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely powerful, and most Republicans who have discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"So reactions won't be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors searched "Come November!" while demonstrating on Senate halls when Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic said.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse charges brought to the appointed Supreme Court, analysts suggested that he might follow a counter-reaction if the Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This turned into a mix-up for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh could be confirmed, but also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, an electoral support group for Democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided on the part they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe strongly or think it's likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said they believe it strongly or that it's likely that Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the charges against Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, in a state of drunkenness, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exposed her genital organs to her as she participated in a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt to contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, in a way that makes Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely overdone at once.
"We don't ask for permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a Saturday post on the Medium that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he was awarded the highest military honor of Britain.
A commemorative stone was developed Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it is “greatly symbolic” that the stone will be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dark fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery," opened the way of the soldiers, then attacked only one nest of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “one thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel humble.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just to not be able to trace the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 struggles, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., exactly when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, spectators in Britain were amazed when the broadcast was replaced by a Peppa Pig episode.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to children's cartoon as "a kind of bad joke."
“Government regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company, said that in the future, they will plan their events in such a way that they can also be followed by spectators from Britain.
"When I think about replays, I think we might be able to solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday day here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mix-up.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We're going to sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer fans more and we exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he was inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he's talking about gay people's rights to give them "hope".
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional issue, will be missing a few months because of a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lesser" to others because "it was socially not acceptable to like boys and girls as well."
He said, "So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the power and endurance to acquire success."
He wanted to prove that it was "someone," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk because he felt lucky that he could live free, without trace, and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said that he "was taken by surprise" because he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the winner of the Oscar Prize, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he attended the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years, "he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who had spent the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed "the whole perspective."
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing but winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father's name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received the London 2012 Olympic Games tickets, because he wanted to be the first.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be able to be first, father," he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
In the following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that's what I've been dreaming about for a lifetime, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympic Games, there's no feeling more beautiful," he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, which encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still thrills him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed on to the reserve bank on Saturday, in Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he plays in his forty-seven game in Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelveth time, another record, was passed on to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the furballs and forks samples on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S. team, the winning top of the major tournaments shared the day between being a cheerleader for the teammates and exercising their blows, hoping that it would straighten out what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the most straight drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow field at Le Golf National, where long areas of rough often punish incorrect blows.
And if the land is not a challenge enough to sea, in the ninth Sunday Mickelson match will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous champion at the British Open, who has allied himself with Tommy Fleetwood's novices and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's match might prove absolutely crucial to the Americans, driven four points at the entrance to the 12 simple matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk said he trusted his player's ability, but couldn't have said otherwise anyway.
"He fully understood the role he played today, he beat me up, he hugged me, and he told me he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of faith in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he was gonna play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened and that's how I thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which did not rise to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, it likes to joke with players, it's a great guy in the team locker," he explained.
“I think young players are having fun with him, it’s been fun to see them do it during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game."
Captain of Europe's team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable advance could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 game at Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
“I remember that we had a considerable advance at Valderrama; we had a big advance and at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching as the 2018 team, who won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“So, history shows me and my team that it’s not yet ready.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is only ready after the points are passed on the table.
We have a purpose and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We always said, we need to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what awaits us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted by the way his players dealt with a difficult terrain, Bjorn added: “I'm not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a whole different situation.
Tomorrow individual performances are important, and this is different.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players, that you have to be in the best form tomorrow.
Now he leaves their partner behind and has to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play the simple challenge better than they did with partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was both sides of such returns on the last day: he was in the winning team at Brookline, then in the losing team when Europe succeeded "Miracle of Medina".
"Remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was able to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would love to start with some fast wins, like Brookline, like Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wish, you know, we try to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all subjects," Bjorn said about the simple challenge lot.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany's newest naval forces would have had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War, but this will only happen by year, due to the faulty systems and rising costs, the local press has reported.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" vessel, the banner ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are supposed to be predicted with a strong cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as with stealth technologies, which ensure a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to leave on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, continuing delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime force, will already be old before they enter the service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 crewher was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
The software flaws were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel had too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Military Navy to add future supplies.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as hard as the vessels used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an amazing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say that Germany's maritime power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the military navy "began to remain without vessels that can be sent to missions".
The officer said that the problem has grown steadily over time, because the old vessels have been removed from service without being replaced with some new ones.
He deplored the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had entered into service in the Military Navy.
National Trust spying on the secret life of bats
New research that is conducted on a property in Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how the surrounding bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behaviour of these unpublished flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and Pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in key places around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emitted certain sounds.
There will be a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed, scaled picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grass, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain have fallen considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects their nests, but also the loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thought very seriously to bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the farm Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says this is ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for lilies before performing maintenance work on properties, as simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, and the killing, harassment or disruption of their nests, as well as the destruction of their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team were accused of raping a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for its 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said that they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Golden Ball in front of the video.
"They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of these charges, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicions that hold private life", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player will claim damages for "equivalent moral damage with an adequate amount for the gravity of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims to have addressed the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but subsequently accepted a deal outside the courtroom because she was “terminated by the possibility of revenge” and was concerned that “it would be publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused of, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain "would regret forever" if it lost world leader status in automotive production after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it is “affecting” that Toyota UK has told BBC that if the UK comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays on an agreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis brands of Toyota are being manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My country is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Executive Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of an agreed Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the basis of the ‘fixed on time’ principle: for machines manufactured on the order, the parts arrive at 37 minutes’ intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its factory in Derbyshire, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated accurately to avoid these border delays".
"There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for today's BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but also other producers, shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that raised prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the factory in the long term and ultimately lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the 24-year-old Burnaston and is responsible for the United Union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "Experience has taught me that once these jobs disappear, they will never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "retarded another week," as the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump's aid and Russia and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors about Trump's possibility of firing the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, have been circulating in circles in Washington for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through amendment 25 to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a week's investigation of the FBI's accusations against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not yet been established once in this regard. It can be this week or it can be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are now happening at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge this statement: Sanders had no press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Gazda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy to TV reporters, who liked to perform, although he added: “I do not deny that they like to show themselves.”
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President participates in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analysed the figures."
"There are still briefings," Sanders said, "but it seems much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the President of the United States, not to me.
We are trying to do this most of the time and you have been able to see that we have done this many times over the past few weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace the press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre places, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health shall be addressed in a letter to EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit’s concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under the conditions that are less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to meet the costs of seeking permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken this autumn.
But the UK government has begun to prepare increasingly and for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement for EU exit.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside the European Union, have a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after she has suffered a blow to the head
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a blow to his head on Saturday, in the game that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ at Tennessee.
The main coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place shortly before the break.
"He reached the line of the cough and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie's mask was put on oxygen by the physical preparers and the medical staff, on the cough line, before sitting on a stretcher and carrying it from the field for a thorough assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/exploitation of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, student in the year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five total shots before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of the stamp court fee on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is about to announce today.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with voting rights, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp court fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
Overlay, which is added to the current stamp court fee, including high levels two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of the new properties built in London are bought by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "famous cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to lower the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining prices on property as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theresa May to waive fees for affordable houses in order to solve the "home problem" of the UK.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive reform proposals in the real estate sector, including checks on rents and cessation of unmotivated evacuations.
He also wants to offer the councils greater powers with regard to the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I will dedicate my prime mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means correcting the problems that exist in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies based abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as British hardworking residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become one far too far away, and life under unholy conditions is far too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the national team of Scotland”
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his ultimate goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the national team of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of "resurrevance" the North-Estic Club, which is now in the 3rd place in the First League, with a three-point difference from the first place.
He moved in this summer to the Light Stadium team after last season's return to the St. Mirren football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We've come to national team B and that's about it," Ross said to Sportssound at BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood following the Scottish matches in Hampden together with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will have this opportunity only if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as directors of the Sunderland Club, there are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the club Alloa Athletic said that he has no emotions being the successor to such consecrated names and to such an important club after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and could affect my success is the question, "Can I help this team return to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her to get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the return of the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in management, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the club alloa come back after he demoted into Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from retrogradation, helping the team win the championship title in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the leadership of the club Alloa.
“I really thought my role as manager was better suited than that of a player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we had a good time, and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I'm facing similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it's the thing that suits me best in my entire adult life."

This summer's heat wave has led to an increase in income in UK pubs, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA company that provides business advisory services and that carried out the survey, said: “Consistent heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a printing press in July, similar to that in the previous month, when pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers less than 1.8% in the June restaurant industry decreased even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the food-serving pubs have experienced heat losses, but not as big as the restaurants.
Looks like people went out into town just to eat drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM company that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to lose, although the drop in sales by 4.8% a year will add to current cost pressures.
Long summer cannicular could not come at a worse time for food business operators and only time will decide if the moderatest temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of new sites launched.
The company that monitors sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official standard in the industrial sector.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that he hides from his parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that hides from parents and teachers.
A survey carried out at the level of 20,000 gymnastics students revealed an increase in "false" accounts
News has raised concerns about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "main" account that they show parents
One in five children, some even up to 11 years old, creates an account on a social network that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnastics students revealed a rapid increase in “Fake Insta” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The issue raised concerns about sexual content posts.
20% of the students said they own a "main" and "clean" account that they show to their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, noticed the posting of a teenager who wanted to be "violate".
According to research carried out by the United Kingdom Digital Awareness Company and the association of directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmisers' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11-18 years have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they hold secret accounts.
HMC's director Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don't have access to."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Commission of the Athletes of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle was elected as director, without executive power, of the Atlantic Commission in Scotland at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated track and field athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sport to take advantage of the vast experience it has acquired internationally in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the entire community of athletes from Scotland, the UK, as well as from around the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle also said, "I'm delighted that I can represent athletes and hope I have a real contribution and can help the way sports in Scotland go."
Athlete of American nationality, which won the 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games, besides the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at BBC, remained invalid after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide if I would recover or to what extent.
It was titanic work, but I completely recovered, I learned to go again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouragement messages!"
An advertisement for breast pumps comparing women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pump company has led to the division of public opinion in the online environment with an ad comparing breast milking mothers with cow milking.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", Elvie consumer technology company has launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I am moaning, but I have no tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not urea, but my boobs."
"Pompez, pumping, breast-feeding, pumping, pumping, milking from girls."
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions by those who viewed it, many of them saying that it would reveal "golds" in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen children only a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Others defended the complaint, a person claiming that it seemed like a "hilarious" commercial.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The complaint is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement for mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like “the cows”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into bras.
The concept underlying the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and matches discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility to hold their children in their arms and even to go out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “Pompa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such bold and challenging launch.
Comparing nursing mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump gets to the front page.
During the presentation of the fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been hidden in a refugee camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration caused the institution of the child placement procedure to sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the customs and immigration authorities (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told the Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Subsequently, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Approximately 80% of those who are sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we'll keep looking for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the processing process in the children's system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court at one month's notice, and not at 60 days as required by the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case through a video appeal, not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempted escape, according to the shelters and reports of the system in recent months.
Lawyers have stated that these concerns are accentuated by a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicate that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to refugee camp without providing them enough emotional preparation time or to say good-bye to friends could cause them trauma, many of them already suffering.
Syria calls for the American, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria had been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the Acting Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “situation will be properly managed”.
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any preconditions," he said in the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been destroyed from their homes.
He also said that Damascus will continue "this sacred struggle until we remove the terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops from the United States, which are particularly concerned with the training and counseling of Kurdish forces and Arabs in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-stricken country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem stated that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "responding to irrational fears", which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return."
"There are political influences on a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to ban the last group of rebels created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a massive assault with Syrian forces, supported by Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear boundary" and expressed the hope that the military action would target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes soon to meet in a first meeting of a new committee formed by the members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "the review of the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why will Trump win second term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be reallocated in 2020, unless the process of dismantling or scandals will end his term as president earlier, which most of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would, without any doubt, be "the most dramatic final of a term of office of president of all times!"
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, the Fox News television station is tracked, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was tracked by 1.7 million, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" at MSNBC recorded a record of audience with 3.5 million people who watched it in the evenings where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we can't understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the dramatic "Reserve President" series at ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and authorship of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be integrated and the state of the global economy.
Change of job is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of debate by an expert committee of the way that Bob Woodward uses "deep background" sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("an opulent clothing item", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking descriptions of Trump's "Anatomical Parts" of Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A lot of what makes you feel like you're looking at a reality show and feeding you with topics every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and creator of the "Amanet's Aces" issue, about the constantly changing distribution and the daily situation overturns caused by Trump (the opening of a Cert with the American Professional Football League, the praises brought to Kim Jong-Un's address).
Don't let yourself lose an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, there were 27 degrees and there was sun, and he stood inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
You couldn't get rid of the TV, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember I was doing some kind of shows that came out of the ordinary in the past, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

Overlapping external financial resources for the most tight mid-term elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of the electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh brought the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb into the race, who won in another district the special elections in the spring of last year.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, and the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th new electoral district race has sparked a competition in the financing of campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in special elections, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
Over a decade the office was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, democracies enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States considered penalizing the El Salvador state because of its agreement with China, but then gave up
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the president of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the leadership team of the Trump Organization.
The State Department officials decided to call on the American chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
As internal meetings have made progress, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in preventing migrants from being targeted at the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the top of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any sanctions examination for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats have said.
And the three American ambassadors came back quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports have been co-sponsored by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of keeping anonymous.
Study of history
The next thing that might happen is the report of the special advisor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation and investigating the existence of a plot between Trump's campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the American elections.
If Congress is to change, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, even when he is preparing to stand before the voters and possibly a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we must make on both sides of the Atlantic and which will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
I failed and I have thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing such critical moments right now.
What are we going to do if Trump's gonna fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since he reported in this paper that last year he suggested the president's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with his role as president.
Rosenstein said the Times report is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Hebrew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will be host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrians game, after the impressive equals in Spain against the Villarreal team at the beginning of the month, will place her in a strong position to qualify for the G group of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow middle Graham Dorrans to play this season up to 2-2 with Villarreal, but it considers that the Rangers team can use this result to its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
"We started the game thinking that we're going to get a good result and we won a point.
I probably could've signed up at the end, but in total, I think the equal was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we noticed better in the second.
Thursday, it will again be an important evening for Europe.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having support, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, considering my accidents and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at this time.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind the last season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that poll participants knew clearly how to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the study carried out by the Nationwide have said that they are discussing with the husband/wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You can't prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you don't become aware of your desires from time to time.
Work with the counselor and the family to discuss the place and way you will be cared for, as these elections could be a significant factor in costing.
Involve your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help in paying these costs.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can secure your own welfare – to the extent that you have the money.
Get legal documents ready: come to meet legal issues.
Get a power over medical decisions to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate to them.
Also consider making a commitment to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Do not forget the little details: imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his drugs and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it?" Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Write a plan on all these things."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle compressed in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air-compressed rifle while walking home after a night spent in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2.30 p.m., as "accidental failures".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
Suffered wounds don't put his life at risk, and the police called on witnesses to give statements.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died due to a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
Due to the interruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regiment, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of the island of Sulawesi, which is at the end of a narrow golf course on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Donggala is a queen lying on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The region, an administrative region that is at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming activities represent the central part of the province's economy in central Sulawesi, in particular in the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: on 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being of Aceh.
2005: a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit the south of the most populated Indonesian islands, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily locked under debris.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of his female sex tried to call the police to complain about alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in custody of the police, at Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is held on the basis of a bail-free guy, worth $500, according to KTUUU.
He presented himself on Saturday in court, where he declared himself "100% innocent" when asked for his plea, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of class A crimes, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a B-class offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged assault.
The case is pending at the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involving a complaint of a domestic violence offence and holding a gun while he was in a state of drunkenness in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Storm and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deceased
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck on Friday the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The magnitude earthquake of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred outside the central province of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Social networks are running videos that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor wishes the capital punishment for the terrorist attack suspect in New York City
New York's federal prosecutor wishes the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It seems that Saipov, 30 years old, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side highway of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent on the request of the capital punishment, filed in the New York Southern District.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack needed a "substantial planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov performed the act as "heavy, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullaević Saipov caused injuries, suffering and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment application case in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but finally, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's husbands were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to documents in court, Saipov, an Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months after the attack.
He testified to the investigators that he liked what he did, as the police said.
Saipov said the authorities felt inspired to execute the attack after looking at the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the registrar.
Also, according to the police, he asked for the flag of ISIS in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocent with respect to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the office who represented Saipov, said that they are “evidently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply capital punishment, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament from the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative party’s conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians must "feel pressure" from Euroceptics, following a statement by a member of the Theresa May Parliament who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, MP of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "exited" so far if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge that May faces in terms of the highly divided camps was accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest, against the exit of the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister is fully trying to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is properly carried out, facing the attacks by those who support the abandonment of the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as by the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the euroceptic and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wants to "resign to the Chequers Plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, we were no longer in the European Union," he said.
Parliament's conservative member, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: "You support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "I have not fought in the world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on the change of public opinion to the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people’s voices.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and our activists who go out to the streets and who support us in the first place in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers who maintain their functions are those who respect their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said that politicians must be put in a position to "feel pressure" if they are about to renounce the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do this."
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilising the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
A small group of activists raised banners that the "Conservative Party is against Brexit" wrote after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the digitisation of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Democratic Massachusetts Senate spoke on Saturday about her future at a meeting of the city hall in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for election in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Republican Party's House of Representatives, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that could defeat Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event on Saturday in Holyoke was the meeting with the number 36 voters using the format of the city hall since Trump took over the position of president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to arrive in Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government and this includes that a woman is at the forefront."
A suspect was arrested in the case of death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of death that resulted in the death of the LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and acknowledged that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, but that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original batch in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recovers on the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play a crucial role in the race.
Standing first in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and let Hamilton queue the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box a while later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the back row of the cariage and was on the seventh place close to the end of the first tour, even on the day when he was 21 years old.
Then he was in the lead for a large part of the race, aiming at a quick end and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take over the fourth place.
Finally, he stopped in the box at the 44th, but couldn't raise his pace in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me go.
And the team did an excellent job to get victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
Horrible body language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, during a rally on his insistences that she did not facilitate the "excursion" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address himself directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad, immoral, and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say that they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she facilitated the "excursion" of the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Aaaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "run" in September, but Feinstein denied that "run" occurred from her office.
“I haven’t hidden charges that look at Ford and I’m not the one that facilitated the “excursion” of her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
However, her denial did not seem to have hit the president well, who commented during the Saturday rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most awful body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democrats use accusations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take over power in any way possible.
Notice evil, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they need to destroy in order to get power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: the Stars team in Dundee wins with 5-3 in front of the Giants team in Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Stars team in Dundee paid for the loss of Fridays from the Elite League, winning in front of the Giants team in Belfast in the Saturday return game, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened the score before Dwyer got the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard evened the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the League of Elites in this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who had regained ground defeating the team in Dundee by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening performance began in the fourth minute, namely minute 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's step, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan regained the host team in the game in minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the chance to score for a score equal in minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first takeover.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again matched an impressive gap in the minute 27:37.
Later on, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get a lead for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team climb on the 5th place in the ranking, in the middle of the last takeover.
The Giants team, who now lost four of the last five matches, will be hosting Milton Keynes on Friday in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after securing the take-off of an airplane with hundreds of passengers during a earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring safe take-off of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a strong earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several powerful replicas in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave the post at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air company, which was on track at that time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson for the air navigation service provider in Indonesia stated that it is possible that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are sorry for this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency saying that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase because many victims are still in ruins and we haven't had access to many of them," said the agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The valleys with a height of up to six meters devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday a common funeral will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All mini-markets are stolen."
Jan Gelfand, the director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to provide help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" CNN announced.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which had a soldier of more than 550 dead.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia has now declared that one person is missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger has disappeared since the afternoon of Saturday.
She also mentioned that she is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the exact accident and order of events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing track and reached a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses think the plane has crossed the track.
American national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached up to the cheese, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor wound to the head.
The U.S. Naval forces said that sailors working nearby for the renovation of a boat jumped into aid, used an inflatable boat to transport people on the shore before the plane sank 30 meters under water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents of companies registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the history of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. closed its case with regard to the resumption of trial for an accused man who burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to head Quinton Tellis's 29-year-old actions as well as those of his 19-year-old, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received tracking data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, which was in contradiction to his earlier statements, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data turned out that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called to the witness stand and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "truthed because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
According to the timetable, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The High Breed in Bristol claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues as it initially did.
They want to go back to their origins and make the hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another colored person?!
A nanny from New York sues a couple for firing her after she received a "rassist" text message
A nurse in New York is suing a couple for the dismissal of discriminatory reasons after accidentally receiving a text message from her mother, who complained that she was "still a colored person".
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she sued him for "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her discontent when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colored, when she showed up on the first day of work in 2016.
He wrote his husband's Plasco-Flaxman in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he sent it to Maurice twice.
After noticing her face, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that the nanny, who is African-American, did not perform her duties properly and that she had expected to receive a girl of Filipino nationality, according to the New York Post newspaper.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to be granted compensation for the dismissal and calls for the amount of 350 dollars a day for six months, the period when they had to live with them and carry out their work, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that these things are not being done," she said on Friday for the Post, adding "I know it's about discrimination."
The couple denied the allegations that they were racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice because they feared that they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post.
“But did you leave your children in the hands of a person you were wrong about, even if by mistake?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an "extortion" action, Plasco said that his wife will be born in two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to revenge a person under such circumstances?
Don't do that," the bank investor added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple of social networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have shown.
The story editors of Paddington feared that readers would not be able to identify with a bear that speaks, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after accepting the book, said: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
It also stated that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of books was a “dark sweet” after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give him the merit of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye by the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad often calls to tell me that it is very serious and does not think it will survive," Ednan-Laperous said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said: “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines given by doctors for her heart to continue to pump blood began to diminish and come out of her body.
He died a little while ago and the organs began to stop working.
I was forced to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning after her daughter's death, got on the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears were constantly flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two walled women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a smug smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your disposition."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said: “I keep thinking about you will have a domino effect.”
This created the messages “to convey to people that I can call someone or that I can talk to someone, even to a friend.
Exteriorize yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well or that he was depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children gave their gifts and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but she must go beyond it: “It caused a great pain in the family.
We're devastated.
But we need to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – a limited time and limited scope investigation – we could have little unit,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was about to “disintegrate” on the basis of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks until the November 6 elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have a bad result, their attempts to place the winner in the election for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept making calls to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives from North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Phenian did not make any public comment.
A vast majority of northern fugitives are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The largest flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China regards fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates.
Relations between North and South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Phenian for a few talks that had the subject of denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But, Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, we will never be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "historical", saying it is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court as "historical" and said that his temperament is inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made his comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "sterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he was sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he almost screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination," organised by the furious liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony has shown that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is biased against democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not right, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal of Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the accessible law of care or the Roe versus Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"It is not the right time for an hysterical, partisan person to go to court and expect us to say, "What a wonderful thing!" said Pelosi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't talk without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, do you?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman who was performing an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Tears are allowed for the outsourcing of fury, partly because they are understood fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I started to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was grabbed by the back of an older woman, a cool manager that I always felt a little afraid of, and she took me to the stairwell house.
"He must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in the State of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow as Snow and the seven dwarfs".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraiser and swore that she would not race unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so touched by emotions – due to the gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the fury caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of emotions .
"You said I had a nervous crisis," Schroeder recalls about the press's reactions to her.
"You said one of my sponsors was Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my funeral stone.
"She cried?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
Saves that have announced the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China have been surprising and, although it seems to be a long way to go until its conclusion, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively applying taxes for half of all goods in China to the United States.
Beijing has been revenged every time, most recently imposing a charge of between 5 and 10% for US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but publicly yielding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards well, the United States' pressures on trade war could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been expected so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the New American Security Centre (New American Security Centre), an expert group.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for over seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, on-the-spot conditions are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that things can return to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted daily life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe first returned after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points, necessary to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial blow to water at hair 3 from hole 16, giving up Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the performances, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost to holes 5 and 4 in front of the player from the last place in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The first player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost to holes 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, probably being his last game in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's team work and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He hands over the seal to his fellow company, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his matches when I was a kid,” Rahm, 23-year-old, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being just overtaken by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the entire tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they really worked.
This morning there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a tough fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I'm loved by these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to respect them properly.
They played better than we did."
