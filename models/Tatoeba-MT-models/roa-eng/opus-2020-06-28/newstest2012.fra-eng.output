Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
In second reading, MEPs rejected the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister who was currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded a previously disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the ruling of political revenge of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court also to the west.
The bill to cancel paragraph 365 of criminal law, on which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve.
Libyan Victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, election winners are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Interim National Council has decreed the usual right of the Charia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a robbery we cut hands.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respecters of faith are subject to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an who will unite in the place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot represent it and as we certainly would not.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted the help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who was leading the NATO strikes but rather Allah whom they celebrated the greatness of every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shooting, served Islam and our hairdressers turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militarily with Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "croised".
Without land tenure, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will eventually be able to boast of the protection of human rights.
As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, these sharia followers are being prevented from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the interests of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states has published the GDP-relevant information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats every record.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's growth by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (a 0.3% increase instead of 0.1% expected), but France reported a slight 0.1% decrease (which was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated, and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
Results are worse than analyst forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, depending on the data planned and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The yields of Spain and Italy's obligations are rising to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
There are votes in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
Football performance has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football team has also stood up with a good deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicissitudes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football caisse.
In the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were difficult to mount combinations and the game mainly concentrated around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not come to pierce the Czech defence which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support through this gesture the nuclear programme of their country in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities have created a human shield on Tuesday around the Ispahan Nuclear Technology Centre where uranium is transformed.
They expressed openly that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continuously strengthened its nuclear weaponry.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions was reported in Israel.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and take the charcuterie for dinner
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren weigh above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns around him is.
For example, on the tables of obese children, 50 per cent of the carcuterie is found more often than in normal-weight children's families.
19% of the obese had frites at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "obesity is not a chance"
In the families of the big kids sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 students from primary schools in Czech Republic participated.
This was the second edition of "obesity is not a chance", supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever Society.
From the beginning, more than 12000 students from sixth to third enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, or even obese children, is the absence, proper eating and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned for example indicate eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch-dining- dinner, which is the basic principle of a good diet," indicates one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner charcuterie
Specialists draw attention to the fact that for healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families everyone has their own breakfast.
And the worst thing that's been raised is that one tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Even so, breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy frits are more often consumed in obese children's families.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks every day sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned regularly do sports, but for parents it is only half, 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years of age are far from ideal in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favourite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch are the pastas that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
The children did not want any starch, and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health Check
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "obesity is not a chance," a determined determination was made to go to a healthy diet," indicates the results of the survey.
For example, the most striking was for sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children have most often checked white meat and fish as their main dish on the questionnaire and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread and potato pellets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there was a lot from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen later.
The presentations of three professionals from the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach final examinations, the more practical exercises and information are expected.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "crazy."
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) treated how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without particular curve, another one of overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically ammenuize large arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
In this way, we have come to emphasize the character and also not to dress too much in a vision of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making them fit.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides constantly, curls up and does not stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine look can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewed fabrics, or embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information I have received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, that you may know about the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it's better than dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Also reflect on the graphic part of the styling is important.
The stylist does not dress only physics but for example creates productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic designer, told us all about this.
But that's... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the Saturday session with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talent designer knows how to work with one outfit in a different way.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like, for example, this braid-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can dress the naked body, with scarves and take it as a dress.
Either just go up the sleeves or the neck and have an immediate new look.
"Play with it" he underlined.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then begin to contravene it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, towards what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the Ben fashion photographer that the stylist must have many more choices of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services remains friety.
And the familiar faces sometimes regard them as useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to pass in the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
Then we just have to navigate on google and make sure that the boulevard infos state the celebrity in question, whether it's thin or thick, etc...
Honza and Mario placed us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to guide himself in fashion and to know how to assemble models.
He has to contact the people he dresses and it's important to be a good psychologist.
Can guess people, don't flatter themselves, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his cabinet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, my God what horror."
"You'll find a few things that you'll find beautiful and advise you on what to wear them with," said Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what must contain everything called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as scissors, depilation rollers or feeding pins, there is also nylon yarn (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple is not usable because they could spoil the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we weren't just people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, to fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors to avoid inadvertently getting hurt.
There is a real need for skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm talking about isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a little summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course.
I begin to understand more and more that styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, than everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race turns because of a set of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do with it in a morning routine shift at work.
This fills everyone's ambition to a certain extent, but it's no use if no one wants to do more.
The new sub-titled The Run has produced great expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the race series Need for Speed already aged and to pull out a sort of game from the playable parts that would not just count with points.
So we were curious how are the added passages in which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some useless faults that have existed for several years already.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible phonyantis on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're caught up in the adventure that Jack's main hero has characteristic problems and to settle them, he gets involved in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten steps and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite different and interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something unique.
Some environments are quite beautiful, although the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Well, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition to the time frame of an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to this the various races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then run against the watch (traditional double with the chronometer) and then again awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
It's more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as well as this because this element is not likely to hinder and places, in the context described above, in the elements that decorate the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is currently nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go somewhere else.
But although it is possible to find better in the competition the model of conduct is very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
At the differference of the driving model, the collision model is not yet up to date.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self part in crazy volts.
Or it's in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have come out in the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go as it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The great hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way or not.
Otherwise you will meet on a particular location of "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What gets angry are the situations when you see the opponent pass easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you get there, you either have to stand aside and turn them around or stop.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Adversaries still have other benefits.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most annoying at the end of the game when you roll on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs stand before you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a lot of times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change cars during the races.
You need to pay attention to petrol pumps on the routes as you can change cars however most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for right highways and super sports cars with exotic attractions on very technical pipes, for example on lancet roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects online with the Autolog function that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the metro (ca similar) where you run in the darkness on the tracks (ca similar).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really take us for imbeciles.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What bothers is that in more extreme situations, imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery no longer serves you anything.
The sound game is good and the track is chosen.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore very confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good, but prepare yourself for the faults hitting you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The students of velvet in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica offers for the third time festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs of higher schools and secondary classes.
The highlight of the festival consists of two concerts organized on November 17th.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Through the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the festival committee is the rector Vaclav Hampl", says the head of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The key to the festival is the Choeur des lycées et gradués concert, which takes place with free entry on 17 November from 14 hours on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening the concert "Students of velvet" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of higher schools and that of Charles University are held.
The aim of the Festa Academica is not only to celebrate with dignity the International Student Day and to recall the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Union of Czech Charities in cooperation with Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from November 16 to 20 in Prague and Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, msical meetings, student arrivals and other activities.
Interested parties will find all information on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act as negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milan Vicenova began her presentation at the Czech Embassy at the Faculty of Law near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way that a large number of lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Charles University could be envied, she showed how much she took her motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, they resonated the criticisms that he is fade, that he is a round-of-heart, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say that he has cut everyone's breath because he holds his role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of a response to the question: "Who in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", therefore as an important step towards the unity and greater readability of the Union's policy in the face of states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and lived in a short time.
She named the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its fullness" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
In addition, the new septimal budget of the Union must be approved, which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be slim and in the interest of savings, what will be the priority, which countries will most, at least, be helping in the context of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe that is understandable".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted horns, bananas different from large or that no one has forbidden us to do syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe of multiple speeds awaits us
According to the Czech Ambassador, they have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspects more than positively.
It is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
In her view, the fault stems from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what's still this Visegrad group doing?"
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, there are new hard rules on budgetary policy which await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not several-speed Europe, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution of enhanced cooperation".
First of all, it was said that the countries that want to cooperate with each other and those who do not want to cooperate remain in their own area."
"There will be many institutes of this kind and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," says Mrs. Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis that all themes affecting the EU need to be discussed among all EU members and not just the Eurozone members.
History of a trade mark:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the word that expresses IBM as closely as possible, the closest one would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm feeling as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be addressed in the light of people's desire to reflect.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture of care developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because it remains true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano postponed for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
At first, society was brilliant in the discovery of talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - which should replace Palmisano with IBM's head.
The company has been at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, brain-storming online from which many future strategies and innovations are generated.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that gives it a secure position in the field of business.
"Since the beginning of IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology," said Geogre Colony of the firm Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference in entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Grande Bleue", as it is called familiarly in the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown up to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is of course the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, advice services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Its discoveries include the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
This year IBM was with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
It is not all innovations and manufacturings that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not succeeded the bet on an OS/2 own operating system, the Online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you can't emotionally stay stuck on the past," Samuel J. Palmisano notes.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
The difference, for example, is that the Microsoft competitor who is at the base holds and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Prospective Technology
In IBM revenues, the services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, even in 1990 it was with more than the largest participation motley of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM sold low-performing assets for $15 billion, over this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
It continues in investments and even since 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its premier Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investments.
Now it would appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share rose from 2008 to 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the years 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as old "pointers", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then shadowed the firm's founder - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kuss firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - cheese and meat cutters up to the cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, turnover increased to $9 million and the expansion of the firm began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair as director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the moon flight.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold his computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and city management.
With regard to the field of IBM trade, a "Smart Trade" platform was developed a short time ago to help businesses manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the outsourcing strategic centre in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague, and there is also the global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this ass, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and a lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not repel the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved him.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's bond and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separates there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," Rychtarova allowed to filter by showing that she has departed from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina shut the door for him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and I will not change."
"My wife has put in place a paper wedding and I respect her."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we are discussing it in a completely normal way, but we are not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I don't want to know where she's going, who she has a connection with and who she has.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Is this also your concern?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all of them, like each other, are able to get out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that come to pump the blood of the veins of men.
Procurement
Does your half make comments that you are dependent on shopping?
Should you buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy by package at the time of the balances?
In your case, you can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the window-light of the clothing shops, to look for nice clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
Well, for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become for man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"Would I need at least five pounds - should I start playing?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't those sentences remind you of something?
Yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisoning.
Odour and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manege.
Wash the windows, run the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust, dig the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have climbed the sink, clogged the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing must be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness must not be the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sap
"Put this worn-out overcoat in the trash can."
"Are you going to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this digging work on your partner this way several times a day, you are really going to decompose it.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much digging work...
Defamation, persiveness
Defamation, persiveness, but also insults against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly attracted to relationships and are therefore happy to deal with issues such as who, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us can let out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is however a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persive, even despise others and are for their involvement - especially at work in a particularly dangerous group of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jagr has twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the Monday NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made a pass and was named the best player in the game, scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told off-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricane goals for the pallet and presented it to the Butter Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer went down, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
In particular to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turns a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the best three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really glad about that."
"I want to play with him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again on a penalty shot she finishes with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out further complications that ended two to one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) set to the most distant corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," he describes the final goal of the Voracek game.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Candiens did not face an experienced defender their two-butset advance lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the backline was sick, which mostly annoyed the local coach rather than lost wrists because they only played the game with 5 defenders.
"It's no good."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender participated in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory on Tampo Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, because the trips to the west were very limited.
The Czech tourists were travelling for vacations in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a inclination for the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (so for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency agreement that was the condition to travel west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not at all travel.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currencies (Western Currency) to travel west.
The Czechs mostly spent their vacations in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs were buying and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989 the Czechs' journeys have been undergoing a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria was at most,the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad last year in the countries of the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for long travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the travel organizations had Czechs sleeping in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a journey from Czechs was at this time to take away its own food cans, sausages, etc. to save.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of free purchasing of Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased what has caused around 1997 another important moment.
As a result of a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started preparing tours with air charter links since 1997, which have considerably reduced costs in comparison with the previous ones.
By the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free links with almost most developed countries around the world, except for the EU that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to completely line up in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacations abroad including related expenses.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with an unsolved "one bed" situation.
Nearly 5 months already Czech football is without President and he risks that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Football Association will not yet be known after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be made.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek did football go back to divergences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on September 16 when a new President was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was no question of dealing with the way in which it was elected.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - it seemed to be only statutory representatives or officials who had full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for the Status and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences still remain with regard to the election settlement.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model", was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model planned, the third round of candidates who received the most percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate is won.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who will receive the largest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech side is considering the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the voting percentages.
"Only this would make it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the Moravian party's objections and says that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even if he believes that the election settlement established by the highest advantage Pelta status among all candidates.
"I hope that we will vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"So that there aren't yet any Saugrenu ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and he believes that the candidates will cooperate together and constructively in the future.
"Today's qualification in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will be once again on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest experience in the field of professional and regional football leadership.
Rajchl's more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are trends to want to change the design regulations."
"It can again cause a blockage to the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that good reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but can tell if the whole football direction will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee on the ground of reprisals.
At the end of the day, the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the parties to the country's strongest sport association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the Chief of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not have campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don't stand for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of the FRTF which would be favored in advance for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event he wins the election he would only hold this post as President until 2013 the year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me this was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said, is particularly embarrassed by Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of controversial fame who is known in the backstage as lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, this would be even less favorable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still strikes him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how we would be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".
In the event that Paclik triumphed at the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik prior to the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself for example as head of representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew a great deal of attention when he spoke out for the annulment of the Arbitral Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he'd be at the level to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and has also been running the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring it a certain culture."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not shut down his antipathy for the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power of lobbying for high-level policies to obtain more gambling money for sport.
"This is one of the key issues the new President should address."
"If it is the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the president of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass my shares from the Plzen club on to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if elected, the FRTF will have new statutes that should put an end to future disputes about the election settlement.
Jablonec's official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of football performance today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not take place promised precisely to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the previous General Assembly and this two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been footballing for a long time and waiting for Thursday for a President."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he added, but he is first of all linked to the club of Jablonec, he worked for many years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience in leading Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the Statutes were approved which were not perfect as they were all seen."
"If there were not all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the full attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I'm ready to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tried, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he is fully aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long since attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's had a few hits."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many during the campaign."
"That is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent, but he remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is according to him his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
This is supposed to be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to complete all the affairs that begin with the Bohemian or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football," said the Czech Press Agency CTK, the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the top of football would lead to no change in people.
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he told Strahov, where there has been a comprehensible nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believed that delegates would not go to Nymburk for anything.
"If there's only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," as Pelta says optimistically two days before the likely determining day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the FRT would start working hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not please many people, it seems.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, hard work will begin.
He wants to make systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work initiated by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-quality youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do it all by myself," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a particular area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions to get football to take a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
It was stated that he would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth it and if I have people behind me who will keep putting sticks in my wheels and will issue doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have said to me that I should not give up because they would give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great deal of work, and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know how to do."
"Behind him there are people who would play football in such a way that he would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but surely I can't stand any one."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy about it not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would only be a President for Chechnya.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I'm ready to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners will meet in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for President's position, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech Chamber, which elected me as Vice President and knows that there will be successes with me," said Rajchl, who envisages among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on contracts with televisions and on the gambling law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake for all.
As he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football player would lose his credibility," he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"Person can't question Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was initiated by Hasek and would not make any significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
OFO-optics, magnificent pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his legs rest tired in gas water baths.
A book shows which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Stretched out on her back in the water, she observed the artfully arranged bowls, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she noticed in her book without delay all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been probed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Bain Games).The municipal covered pools of Münich, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
It has led its "travels to the most exceptional baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true ferdent bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but he feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimpers should simply contemplate blue tiles and accommodate Javel's powdery water while joggers breathe from the scent enveloping spruce forests or can listen to the gallows of the park's joyful birds.
"I asked myself one day why the pools must in fact always be so ugly," the Viennese said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface doubles the architecture
A dip in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more weight, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"She is on one side transparent, but on the other side reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces present optically in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, trenches.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives the desire to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Along with the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, it found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (caverne bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated swimming pools in the open air of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. As from a roof of the Zürich bath one has the whole city in his eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rises the mountains of Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a odor of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to find itself in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded plot.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
By looking through the window of the building-Art Nouveau in red-white-yellow, she observed the development of weeds between the tiles.
It has seen a opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; not only neo-Roman elements can be discovered that come out of its design in 1844 but also a mature hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization of 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite pool expert's bath, Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to merge building styles so different in such a formidable unit," Meder said.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation about raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wanted to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, it is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions to discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa inquiry into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that speculation of the stock exchanges on global raw materials pushes prices upwards and banks share complicity with world famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in practice aligned with Deutsche Bank's head, Josef Ackermann, even though major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of the experts share the opinion that bettors have sided with offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the different criticism of American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "No case is worth putting into question the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the Bank's head will indicate the consequences.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how today's banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be under particular obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will change nothing to what is planned in the Board of Directors.
He could improve his brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires for 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 per cent found this to be legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into speculations on raw materials.
49% said they would consider the termination of their account to change their bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibitions in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruins.
Now it is again open and takes place of exhibition house.
If one is excited about a modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bright and bold allures and its new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer's pavilion for the Brussels Universal Exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to date.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bowl-shaped building in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang up artwork, so not a good environment.
However, it has been so long used, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly deplorable.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at any point.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco has promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her young artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she has carried out the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, has obtained private public funds and sponsorship and has established the exploitation of them.
Except contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a coffee shop and a bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict surveillance, small budget
For the creation Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his travel to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a breath of energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass reinforced insulating glass in glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made the place to the new farm, a panel of light sieved between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of the origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all of this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Several materials that are good and inexpensive should be found, and that also please the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good consciousness".
But in this case the 21st century House is not located in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Jardin Suisse stands just the "quarter of the central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And one more chance may happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
That costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional this year.
The newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance by invoking a plan-crisis internal to the group, that investments of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snowing of railways and docks should, inter alia, double to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear the decks of snow and ice to the beginning of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Head of Rüdiger Grube station warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it is lacking among other reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years done what it has to do, since it has to have the ICE train axles checked significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE at the Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of US penalties.
After Chief Josef Ackermann's case there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not already sufficient, the past of this giant in the sector catches up with the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison with $145 million (€106 million), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about selling mortgage documents.
The regulator of the financial markets NCUA carries to the big banks a whole series of accusations, and inciting cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a great deal of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said one of Deutsche Bank's interlocutors in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any faults.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred for several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks apart and in summer he assigned JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs to the Court.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the bottom of it.
When the American real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events already date from a few years, at present it blows on the American banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried numerous remedies to obtain redress or to punish violations.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in kind in mortgage business of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which is a total of $14.2 billion in operations for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett is increasing by 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth over ten billion dollars.
Until then the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT computing companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only reveals bad predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knightly attack in the financial world.
Therefore, the IBM IT activity is granted the right to now be called "Mr. IBM".
Car Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic program, which he has purchased since March from IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He commended management, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been focusing on IT lucrative services for some time as the operation of accounting centres.
The pioneer of computer science, over 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation as well as highly performing enterprise calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in businesses that he understands.
On the contrary, Buffett is more concerned with rail brakes, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a whole range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Rück Municchois.
This 81-year-old octogen had resumed in the 1960s" the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had erected it as one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM shares increased by one percent in the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubted the state of German law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and one small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people the spectrum that had been believed to have been dead for a long time has been rekindled: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
If there is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been a question of it.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"This is a return to bloody ideology," "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand points out that one of the authors would have been a V-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing barber.
It was reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: this weekend she called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the door of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a story of success.
The reports of certain Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the murder series.
Therefore the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of its univocal conditions.
"ça begins puer", This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people would have been killed, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was very critically perceived on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier in the German authorities' minds to do research in certain highly right-wing suspect environments, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be clogged, there will be nothing left to migrants but self-defense and armament."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says Selen.
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance from acts of violence could lead.
However, the attacks have sharpened the feelings of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat mistakes of the past
Once again, it is mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how much mistrust of many German-Turkish people has been deeply towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost bankrupted the financial crisis and skated from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was known in July that in 2013 he would occupy almost as spectacular a position: President of the Board of Directors of the Grand Bank of Switzerland UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed her; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recent solidity and made some kind remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A merchant of UBS securities in London had hijacked all of the Bank's security systems and had flaming around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the president of the board of directors of the UBS is considered since suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economy and President of the bank, and would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At the same time, it assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
In fact, the UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saves the proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Up to 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss manager of assets, silent and strong, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a long-time professor in Zurich said, "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In the present view, one wonders: how could I have just been mistaken at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn round to the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli retired surprisingly, which was considered to be a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we felt for what reasons he had left.
The division of the bank had flaming with subprime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this she has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed in silence, to the point that it was never even learned its name.
It was, however, only the first time.
In April 2008 this got worse.
The bank was again to announce losses of billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, retired.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has redeemed the UBS from tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds in shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - as it has noted to what extent this can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total of the 2007 UBS balance sheet increased Switzerland's economic performance more than five times (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says the bank researcher, Geiger.
After the first disaster it followed the second one.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish user data, which had mislead the fisc maybe with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with a fine increased.
Thus, the UBS published more or less that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was some return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, he followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flaming-title merchant 1,7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something didn't turn round.
And it's published: with risk management in investment bank it still doesn't seem to work.
"With the Adobolis case, it has been found that risk management is too little changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
Therefore the financial director of a large German bank is sure: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their role, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still pairing with the solid private Swiss bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snowy peaks of Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's are found here among shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Crédit Suisse to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other ruled out of the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, the UBS and the Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxons' morals."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the collapse: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertook the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to CHF 68 billion, or € 45 billion, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three largest Swiss banks together concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two predecessor banks different from the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, the international investment banks had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascension of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who hears it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuition, who made a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffleli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group has always uttered the same word of order: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
Business advisors, who were responsible for it, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the "Fixed Income" banking jargon, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched itself into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Assuffied by growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the subprime US investments that have invested.
It has become a massive machine that has packed and passed value documents based on American mortgages - but has also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"Still in the summer of 2007, while the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall is.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bank-based.
He who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, to concentrate on the management of goods, to return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to (again) go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it's clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: he had to carry out the business of the UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the stage in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He says publicly until now only that he was going to seek an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart corneals spread in cities
In many places, brakes are considered to be "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornellas have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "the bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on corneilles, the experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt out the brakes of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature protectors were based on the problems of cities as well on the exodus of particularly protected brakes: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, planting and slaughtering of typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couvation pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest of which include Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative ads due to the slaughter of the cornella in this region.
Critics found bird capture in traps and killing them with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the evidence, is useless," noted the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressured water or cutting down trees, often producing adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are moving away, the big colonies are dividing and they are scattered in other places."
The evidence is only imaginable in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the appearance of animals at a bad packaging and hanging offers, in order to enable them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens looked for "info panels instead of crossbows" in order to establish completely different relationships with: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-way-educational corbelli at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the life of these very intelligent brakes.
This project has been adopted in the meantime by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a great deal of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Brakes not only use working instruments to achieve a regal, but they themselves manufacture their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists at Cambridge University tested four freshmen recently, to what extent is the intelligence of the birds.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crush a scaffolding with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone should have some thickness and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning corneals were then to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds couldn't reach their bute with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wires at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo draws Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks were unsuccessful.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have bought the last tickets at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal forged against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs have reached the game of elimination by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also burning in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland released 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other strips for Portugal.
The former Bundesliga player Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11 m-penality (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) did twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red map (54e).
Bosnia had already failed at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30 metre free blow in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities of distance pull and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did not accomplish anything, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English Manchester City Championship, started a headball directed to the bottom of the transversal bar, the ball didn't cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek set a goal for Czech
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnia Penalty, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the yellow map to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played in the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But, after the break, the European Vice-Champion of 2004 succeeded four blows and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also got lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
A goalkeeper Petr Cech has prevented a final-minute reflex by potential Tomas Sivok (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the two Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface just next to the shot of Cech.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class Czech guard already shot down, once again the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's soccer miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his position on the third-party bank of the MS of 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice at their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in 62 e Minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy got the first opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first Butter.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After a unsuccessful defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will lock the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Up to 2015, approximately $2 billion (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from approximately 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global company software leader will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of SAP's 176 000 global customers are located in this growing country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.

SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now, we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"°Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Tears: An Intimate Story of the First World War), it starts with a long list of characters that tightens your heart.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make your mark-page.
You will learn about these people in detail. In this Romanesque account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mist of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he described, accurately, as "a book of anti-history."
It has some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like." We find there "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, passing by doctors, ambulancemen and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, become mad or lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the candles of a church: while some of them die out, there are new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It brings a disdain to the idea that the First World War is only summed up by the terrible war of the trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skilfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an unattainable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such a natural disaster, such as a Katrina hurricane, which is a source of courage.
When canon blows keep you away, and when you're a mother at home, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or passionate, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "the beef made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; seeds of wood shoes."
He states that "837 substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-selling best-selling, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your worn shirt and fenced.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret".
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a story of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the cattle of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated mass and convinced ideologically, in well-cut clothes, who performs his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; they find as many basic behaviors as heroines.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genital organs in hopes of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captured the way in which the war " sparked forces exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People start to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come out of his book, seized from your hands this page where the list of people is displayed and burned with an matches.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation was kept secret from all the outsiders of a few high-ranking officers as well as from the beginning informed that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be repeated episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the regulation of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police officers were prepared to observe occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that consist of rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session was held on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move to the park reached "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as to "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only people who know they're going to get there are at the top of the Police Department hierarchy."
The city was able to learn a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October last, police officers wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages renouncing loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers were entering the park equipped with their clear blue windscreens, many protesters simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 told the police, leaving time for the occupants to collect their affairs.
Other police teams were identified on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were required.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of Police Department, said that this action had only been taken for security purposes.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly taken by the officers.
Browne stated that television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the Police moved west across the thick business sweeps of protesters, including luggage, plastic lawns and bags of sheets filled with clothing, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicenter of the camp hung up together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3.30 p.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "twisting in public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most graduating officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, while currently "not leading the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen were waiting along the eastern side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a paste of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped into the hood of a police car. Others were spotted cracking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a tip of plywood came out of the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The School Aids Union continues the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school grants that have lost their jobs last month, plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals.The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school grants, parents' and other employees' coordinators, who were among the less well-paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October last year. The union leaders compared these layoffs to political revenge for not letting the city access a health fund led by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the closed budget in June.
One member of the Council replied, noting that school allowances were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would complete a notice of claim, warning the education department that it would be prosecuted; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions of the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the department of education in the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight female workers who are laid off, all black or of Latin American origin, such as most of the school grants that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would focus on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa establishments, 17 school grants lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts in the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five out of eight students in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution states that "This is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrolment.
The union also asserts that the high school directors could have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "outflow" to describe the action, even if "outflow" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "six parents coordinators were dismissed", and "not just because of overruns".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats had reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will have required a successful uprising, capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution consists in honouring the Libyans' courage as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of US operations in Libya.
The American mission has therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress has been upset enough to criticize Obama's mission management, but not enough to cut the grass under its foot.
Congress's indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Richard D. Lugar Commission (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not read the latest version of the new project yet.
Within the Chapter, this week the House must vote an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have not so far succeeded in having their amendments approved, but it is not without having tried.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled in Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations in a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "conquer federal expenditures".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to do their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) passed last August called for the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms of office during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose it.
As keen as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed down from the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not battene" says Gabrielle Giffords during her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the tip of Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a TV show Monday night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and said he wanted to first of all recover rather than go back to Congress.
During his appearance in the television newspaper "20/20" on ABC, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The program approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first TV interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called his recovery "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords answered "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place in a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show retraced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, she was seen on her hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on her forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A lip movement.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with doctors, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped her and asked for information about the six people killed during the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated while awaiting trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're gonna get out of it, get back and get even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie suit stood at his feet to acclaim it.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A senior military officer at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of U.S. Armies, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as a sort of orphan," wrote senior military officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us up in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognized or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about mercy take place in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service in two perspectives.
Some would respectfully look at them because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were conducting the interviews were asking for a subtle request if he would be able to take the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
"When you address the subject of the service, you face negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely praised by such a unfamiliar country with the army, which sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a military.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army faced the growing pressure of severe violence against the rapists
This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rapes.
If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008.She returned to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"This was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, thrown on the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still on duty and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice during a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
It was ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, who initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's taking it from the gallon military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by US counsel Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged misdemeanour is inherent in the complainants' military service" indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still have no official right to fight, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq, as in Afghanistan, the teams of female soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives — two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for having claimed to encourage a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality problems" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network Service, a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with requests for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report issued in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases registered in the army were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case described their aggression as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the military police of the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rap kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial, but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned in less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether Lyman and the other complainants are going to move forward or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is a decade behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as the responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Where until we died, one or the other of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration online opinions.
Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time preceding the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Sign in to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find people they've been looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. Questions were asked about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interrogate 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook became the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, researchers in medicine and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "Like", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work whose site name appears in the title almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a great deal more chance of being alcoholic than discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that colleagues from students, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Institute for Research for Children in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied the statistics on the situation of Valentine's Day and Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Happiness Index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make available its data treasure to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they have not even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than by going through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they knew, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
Cold and inhumane: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted having organized the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "of resistance" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Temples of Norway," he explains in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I forgive it, because you have your mandate from organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to leave him with the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, to speak to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for 12 more weeks, barred him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All of them participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," declared a survivor of Utoya on the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made a little headway after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed with a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a broad "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not mad. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the movies this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished himself by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs, which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizer of organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "maladian letting them think that a brilliant idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had left Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly uphill, is the basis of the 68-minute movie entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
You're incredibly careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurrects, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him blows of elbow to make him speed up and move on to more important questions or subjects.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, one finds an oddly missing aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers to be good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something gross and inspirational about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them then put them into action.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?" and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
It is perplexed about how the costs were recorded - it is often initiated by a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack telephone networks and phone for free in long-distance.
The device was the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an appropriation act is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you were yelling at in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much, but we were able to invent a small thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed one day without that.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Bleue Box in the middle of the night by passing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go mad just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love with technology (and Marking of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and passes him a wire call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs obtained a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only business I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode-ray tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager who I was returned to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a headshot.
At the beginning of his career, while he settled down to sell some printed circuit board cards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, it must take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembered the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a lot of big fights... I was yelling at him claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 that would be incredibly reliable.
Large companies that are suffocating themselves:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyer or a better printer, and after that?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [they are these types of people] who end up leading companies and product specialists are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotting by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox's...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
Some things you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories, too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made for personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents while the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court meets in private to examine the question of political discord, namely whether opposition to President Obama's law of health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question concerned a 26-State trial challenging Congress's ambitious health care reform last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental 5:30 p.m. argument is expected next March, and the result will likely be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue about the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as a solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal office, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and a stated opponent of the Health Act.
Top guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising from law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an intervener, an honorary guest, or on the program of such an event."
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has been sufficient to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and collecting gala funds with lawyers who have court cases in court."
Their presence and their participation in the fundraising of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming that they mix court affairs too easily with the agenda of groups such as the Société Fédéraliste.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor of Obama's administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that he had invested too much in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication she would.
Boeing records a record $18 billion order for airline aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-collar lined planes, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a matter when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches a record $18 billion.
Just as incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine growing in future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that the Middle East airlines will need $2,520 in the next 20 years with a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-collars.
It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would amount to $26 billion in total.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The sum of these six aircraft amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise of the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates' command reinforces Boeing's predominance in the wholesale aircraft market and helps to slow down the attempt to entangle the Airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautical show comes four months after Airbus' announcement to re-run the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repels its beginnings to increase its thrust as a result of the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
The Boeing Company's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister obviously beaten in the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race as governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the position of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race as governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral officers... they took the ballot box, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until "to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only recently stood out from Calderon, who was the leader of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or NAP, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a mayor of the NAP was assassinated as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections air, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area to exit the sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers at the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties of an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it's not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian borrowing was dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The thriving sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked the fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has raised the appeal of the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag has predicted that the IMF would bring all Asian aid, but he has also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the obligations of the United States financial bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would provide more negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital arrivals.
"He only wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to make Europe accept aid to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day, or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they leave on a sun holiday and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The SADB forecasts of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risk of loss" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "work out relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leakage.
Serious Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, raised the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, passing through the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digrating $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more of cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"So important a reduction, so applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although wartime financing of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contractors would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support war."
"The salary managers would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not what we should be imposing on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and recent warnings by senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he has reached the highest position in the Pentagon, accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential opponents."
"In fact, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the chopper, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to find a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
Congressman New York and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, passed for an idiot, quickly emitting disdain contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-marital liaison.
And then, none of the one who has lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The tricherie stories at the school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have provided the test responses to students in order to be able to see themselves well on their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that they lie and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or identifying lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I have had", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on lies have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eyes.
They don't beat, roar, or shake.
Not to conclude that mentors are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
The good mentors are able to read the others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call establishing the benchmarks.
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, and vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally stirs his feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him stir his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for hints of verbal and non-verbal deceptions.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is done just to seek to trigger the post-interview response.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your topic.
The famous Scott Peterson derailed using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distanced language: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on the rails.
TransCanada stated Monday night that it will move the pipeline projected outside the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval for an pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"This is a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
In order to do so, it would have to cross six States.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have focused on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan pressurize that a law for forcing the remoteness of the Sand Hills region and the Ogalallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact assessment found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other question is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a breakdown of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrorized their little girl to the point where she was afraid of it.
The draw of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month-old young Geneviève Monk, to such an extent that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disturbances" and "the increased fear of foreigners," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife as a kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to their boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle has angryly admonished pregnant women.
"She said of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "what you say or think I'm not interested."
She became enraged and started using jurons - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," says the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held back by her entourage that led her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so loud that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's excuses, but received no response.
Lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
In the first year of managing Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, called for change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, apart from the losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of allocations by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main crops affected have been vegetables, corn and chican peas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of the year an accelerated increase has been observed, as during the period from January to March 55,053 signalees were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed signals, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn, to invest and use them in something," he says.
Migration in detention
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the signaoen labour market worsens by considering the high level of the lack of serious ones that prevails between the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the shift to the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7,000 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in the Foreign Direct Investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretary of Economy from January to June, the State FDI has reached $630 thousand,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5 million,143 thousand,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos a year, registered mainly by the tertiary companies.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3 billion pesos loan for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November no benefit of debt was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For employers' representatives, Mario López Valdés' first year of government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Industry of Transformation, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really poor, it is necessary to work hard to recover the terrain that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and especially the already synchronized good progress of this new team of government, hopefully next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year ice cream retained the economy of the state and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flux is produced from several events, including frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level and flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confédération Patronale de la República Mexicane de Sinaloa, said that it is intended to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be realized," he says.
A lot to do
The President of Copromex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way in which public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted petty trader is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small dealer circulated in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and in the copilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to works
Social literature seen in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
In total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for credit to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided at that time.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages could arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us anything."
The Cour valide "The Analog Cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree that advanced the so-called "analogue coupure" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to bring about the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is a legally reserved allocation to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and by admitting complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by the decree for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers also decided to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project that Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible for.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of State leadership.
The substitution of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years, and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to defer the benefits of digitization which implies a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "required the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, a group of allocations which the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere respect for the laws issued by the Legislative, it will.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán is analysed.
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality with respect to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State has approved reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted its publication within the time limits provided for by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state attorney for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he does not have the right to "sanction or contest".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to realize the partial and total discounts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of the vote and count in the record of the ballot box is not found in the president of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all polls of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the candidate obtaining the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition that presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total counting of the ballot can also be achieved if, at the end of the joint counting, the difference between the successful candidate and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that were the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of requiem.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be spread in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving the tributes to other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.

For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a affectionate brother and cared a lot for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he had even a lorry; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His last farewell.
With honours it was said to the late Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.

Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadreyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented eleven persons arrested in the same municipality in front of the media for organized crime offences.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of the road from Cadreyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside about three metres, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a distance there was another individual's body with a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were spread over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three persons had been murdered elsewhere, as no in situ casings were found.
In the closure of the property there were legends directed by a group of delinquency organized to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured at Cadreyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating primarily in the municipality of Cadreyta and who are considered to be involved in kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and jeopardized the whole of the Eurozone.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti for dispatch, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian obligations BTP at 10 years above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria employer, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government a lot".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's opportunities for success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, to the press.
PDL's support, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed Monti's largest technocrat government.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a devastating new attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread prediction that politicians would only give it time to implement reforms before the elections were advanced.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process of financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened took part in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friend, at 15:05 hours, at the Stade National de San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, record a broad record of Class A inter-selected games, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, keep an intense activity in national league and coupe championships and in European coups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
On the contrary, Costa Rican footballers have international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) has matched the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will today play against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain wheel, 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other hundred-year-old Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the Schalke precinct, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outnumbered the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest can't even be 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
The historic boutique of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively to Viva from Brazil, last week.
The group is located on the south American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day they will appear on the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcription of which is in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far this has been great.
I only spent my vacation in Costa Rica once; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a sort of devotion to the group, fans live intensely in the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so long had to go through this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we like to surf and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, off the coast of Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
By watching the tour, you had offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this about?
I think it's partially because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we haven't interpreted for a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of journey.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very emotional.
We love each other and love creating music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a group like yours will stick together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and this could not go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If you don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what brought it, not to mention the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first this was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and we have not published a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration that she lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we're still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
What do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first ones I remember was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups that I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening to and the groups like Mudhoney are now making the best music that ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which are described as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and those songs, they probably represent that for me.
I also think that we can also be happy, and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength on his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, aged 72, serving a prison sentence of 25 years for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he was operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times of language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosion gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and foot traffic problems, has listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving his term of imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people due to an army annihilation squadron who had been operating clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and patrons, will launch a visit on Tuesday to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of its ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has in force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to deviate the implementation of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
On the commercial side, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTT) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mostachu plumber passes three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the bad Bowser's claws, but he never did it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, has been designed from the start to better exploit the characteristics of Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopic surgery should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of 3D time" were adaptations of the existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "Agressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "success to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the plumbier moustachu must travel peril-mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even if I play, I find new things in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he gave order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$70 million.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country which called for Portillo to judge it.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive by taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office he had "not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given instruction to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was an absolute diversion of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial prior to extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of century.
This is in addition to the long centennial of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly trained people, without work, with problems of drug abuse or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in those 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the event the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Advisor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Chief Charity Officer of La Caixa, James Lanaspa, were also present in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to be able to fight the wrong circumstances and to give hope to the people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate to 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Street Balmes number 51 lived was over.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they were illegally occupying and organized micro-feds that desperate the neighbors, in court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from happening again.
"From this day on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The Squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and some of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and desperate the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that from the occupation of the building his case fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfairly competent, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation facility had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially those who participated in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the neighbors angry in the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since this one "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the mayor's PP group, asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common and civil life that it caused residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to the 35th Street Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide with the opportunity to convene beyond the controversy over fees.
The municipal contest on the 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Towards the mid-1980s, in the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a numerical comparison with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one not oriented on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with leechers in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors at Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of the park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question would appear alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a theme of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme whose two members of this former caste of elus speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that coincide with three architects from Barcelona, academic professors, who presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is opportune.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to debate" on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of green houses pasta has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the larger park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title "ports de Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think of them "such as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Perils that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and that had in the Forum area "sing of swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which we can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its excess.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
In keeping with the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity offered by the mayor to her corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("everything a success," he says) that we have to create: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument".
Bayona insists that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition lack a global vision of Collserola: "We have called 16 cross-sectional contests - it says - in the direction of the sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This makes, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In other words, a project so that one of the doors can collide in the program and define with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, a zone of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red's legal power foundation granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for so-called blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee for the Mayor of Monterrey to allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the mayor's brother PANISTE and on September 2 he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Ministry Officer 3 of Heritage Offences, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued to him after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the prison center of Cadreyta presumably for having had the owners of Casino Red sing with a million and a half pesos with a million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Penal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the cashing of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for his operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and that associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
File 197/2011 provides Jonás Larrazábal with legal forgiveness and no claims relating to the trial against him will be filed later; he will not be asked for compensation and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazababal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to her the order of immediate liberty that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons, lost their lives, indicated that the helicopter crashed directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contact with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area do not relate to the appearance of ground parts.
"In a research we reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees incline.
For the time being, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last for a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, CEO of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the state helicopter Major Presidential was operating at a speed of cruising and it happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation to cruize at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM referred to adequate conditions for take-off, and at and fro the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-level nebulae layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the nebulity conditions the crew sought a lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft's residual dispersion model suggests that the helicopter hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Traces of fire or explosion have not been detected:
There is still no trace of an explosion or fire at the site of the disaster.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple ground contact.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand,200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope from seven degrees to 30 degrees incline.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people, called 'Genetics of obesity of children and adolescents' protocol that will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialities Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation is invited to participate in the population with or without the right to attend the sporting units participating in the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (southern Federal District) and finally in the Sportsive Morelos Unit (northern Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he said that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years old, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It has detailed that the Saturdays will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin and genetics (the people associated with childhood obesity are being identified).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there has been an increase of 77 per cent in obesity for boys and 47 per cent for girls; with regard to overweight, there has also been a dramatic increase', said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search of markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American heredity, 30 per cent of Europe and 5 per cent of Africa, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calorie), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetic alterations.
The information is handled in a confidential way, and doctors write it to parents, each of which explains the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to perform to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay mostly the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking in short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - cornmeal pulp wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Métropolitaine area of Valle de México, averted Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous paving is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his lecture A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory to which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both to highs and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this modified type of asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance, and thus the formation of the cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, it adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that most of the streets of Mexico City were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he pointed out, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If asphalt had been modified, it would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt layer, he said, we put a final layer called bearing layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that the floor has an adequate thickness and the material it is made of must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to do, which softens all layers of the floor and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of forming a cassis, he said, the first to be damaged is the rolling film and only subsequently is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Investigators System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paving should always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid the frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to contend with the fact that she was on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as Colombia's new princess.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princesse and Melina joins a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who have found themselves near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Pretty of Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint Première Princesse is the fact that she did not believe with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literaria Leamos Carteta Literaria.
Here is the Valle candidate's answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a way of culturalizing myself, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince" is a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Chastiment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burn of Blood".
This reply did not please first of all because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because it did not concretely explain how each book quoted it had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and the wise, what must happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (define of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not crack on the stage".
And it was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades the day before the coronation.
Although both parades were self-confident, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Como en casa" program (as at home), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina had been named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the queen's crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle did not succeed in convincing the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one must look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned because of its defects in its back and the fibrosis that was observed in its abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected it as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens' preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too famous, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgery is good, but Valle didn't know how to do it.
His body has never been his asset and he lost it because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was doing in Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, or as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A PCD from Cali has gone into history like the man who has confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4th, a CTI dactyloscopicist from Cali passed on to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopicists working in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the corpses were to be identified.
The year 2000 was transferred to the capital of Valle and after following appropriate courses, he specialized in dactylloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter in Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be one of the man who was leading the world's oldest guerilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonic magnifying glass, ink, picker and lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye was not mistaken: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the one who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Searching for the fingerprint
For a dactyloscopicist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has made in Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying the corpses, dactyloscopicists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher stated that in a case of robbery he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get the full handprint and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and indeed a mark on the bottle coincided.
Even if this does not guarantee that he is the killer, it places him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopicist explained that "digital fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to pick them up.
Later, the fingerprints were sent to Asif, the database of the declinquents, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines isn't gold, all that we touch doesn't necessarily become a footprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
"Indignants" Challenge Authorities in New York · Global Voices
Hundreds of protesters were buzzing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people had access to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integrants of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a court order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated early and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allowed the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignants" to the evacuation of their personal camp dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, ensuring Ephe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property precinct - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of this court order at that time and even delivered it to the police officers who were watching the place, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had beaten the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they previously used'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the protesters, which he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zucotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the protesters 'violate the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than American workers' interests," added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Officials of "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV program of Noel
Aside from Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet broadcast of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, would appear dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crèche a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian-born Canadian actor who recently presented part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared as Joseph.
Besides Anderson and Peters, CTV's special program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine Luisana Lopilato model in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian 'put' during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan was reborn after the earthquake
GDP rose by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ended the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, convalescent even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses at $300,000, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by earthquake and tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with a decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of unbroken increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites you to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructures, use the deficiencies to believe in zero.
Japan has mostly awakened thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "valors safe haven" elected by investors who fled the debt crisis in the eurozone and the disturbances forecast by the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flow line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September of the yen contribution.
While the markets continue to be based in peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower the guard.
"It is necessary to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic downturn in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are constrained.
Because it has dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 10.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in level 100, with eight decimals of up to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservative will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to get involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather imposed by the Brussels requirements that a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment will be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date, that of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message raises no doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the passing of the referendum of Papandreu, yesterday reiterated that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises Spain's "preponderant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation, of which "the essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the V-World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "very specifically, in that which aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar per day, to which is set the "seat of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who has hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are coming out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see an ongoing evolution," said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought him the qualifier of "family leader" gathered in Valladolid from the "poor banker".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit implies "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to the "exclusive to whom all the doors are closed"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President with universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) Congress in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, was held without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned for the programme but imposed in autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who judge the government's policy too lax to the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, after their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellor - and of the motion - stands in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is no less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs directly depend on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission with universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the bolt is laid.
Similarly, delegates rejected to an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the European Central Bank director depending on the weight of each economy, which, of course, strengthened Germany's weight.
In order to ease the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty soon to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for the hollow.
In recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sick leave fraud represent?
After the benefits, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and the assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less telling of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the sick stops.
First of all, for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on private workers a fourth day of shortage before taking over a job stop.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could cause anger, but would bring EUR 280 million back, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic nature: to impose on officials a day of non-compensated deficiency in the event of a termination of work (they have so far no period of deficiency, against three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revive the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to job arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, furthermore, if you are caught, you will be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand told the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most often bearing fruit.
No more sick French people than anyone else in Europe.
Let us first wait on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances represented 5% of health expenditures in 2008 with €1.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were for sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And so 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French averaged 14.5 working days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that conceals some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management Site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of sick leave.
Another study, this time of Health Insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of sick stops were less than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days to one month, 15% one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French employees are no longer more inclined than elsewhere at work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health or non-health reasons) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is very little faced with black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only small in size.
Strengthening the legislation since 2002 means that controls are systematic on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 made for short-term decisions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled arrests of over 45 days, 11% were "inadapted or unjustified" over 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that is very little faced, for example, with work in the dark.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, the latter would represent €9-15 billion in non-tax earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to correct its economy.
This is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, told Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos planned that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Righteousness Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right wing, gave Monday his support to the measures already approved to try to break out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit itself to additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's New Democracy MPs.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak to their doctors about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
The experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has led to a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
Medalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reporting to us experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
Overall, it is in Quebec that this rate is highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide in non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, the co-signator of the report, there would be more cases of these spills in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It should be recalled that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out for euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are less valuable.
As for those who practise assisted suicide, respondents estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
With regard to maintenance or cessation of care for a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty of respecting a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts signing the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Mr Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
Now, "in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.

Supporters of Bachar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces a "competition" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a position in favour of a departure from President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "get out of power" in Syria where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bach had the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the leader of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States also welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are becoming more and more harsh" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OHCHR) announced.
Two other civilians have perished "from the exchange of gunfire and heavy machine guns at Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem, however, felt that the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
In fact, he strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which in his view is "a dangerous step."
Syria will not "flight," he added, ensuring that "the wet plots against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also supported the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is planned tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities, in response to the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for some time in the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and employers today.
It should establish a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after meeting the President of the Designated Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list, probably a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that markets will be patient and will understand".
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he estimated.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he took office, to work in the urgency and for the purpose that Italy "returns protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for new measures to be rigorous.
The Italian " patron saint" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of serious" and a "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great stranger will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy has to put EUR 200 billion of government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS widely drawn into IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to establish a company producing "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during the bulk of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased from nearly 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has decreased slightly or increased slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49% of which, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and 14% increase in crimes and crimes against religions.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, believing that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civic rights.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter modifies its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in order to allow users to observe the activity of the following, which makes its service look a little bit more like Facebook's.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This makes it possible to know if they follow messages, subscribe to new accounts, have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network Monday, AFP told Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the general Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users were suddenly debating "tweets" focused on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," @jemb123 says.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow some of my Twitter feeds," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Registration of a budget "gold rule" in the constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/Christian Democrat coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the agencies noting the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was lowered by only one head, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest more each year," said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the Eurozone member countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of government deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the structural government deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to submit budgets to balance.
The objective is to move public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back not far from the historical levels that led the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen massively against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has regularly been back since, dominated by purchases of investors who consider it a "valuable refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is passed on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has descended under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This flaming of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago because it requested the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households driven by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister ruled that the cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary relaxation was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Emissions Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
the rates rise, the stock exchange swings
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions over the yields of borrowing from the countries of the euro area in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains."
"The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has shut down 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes over Europe and trade will continue in a narrowly changing corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stable," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, in decline by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing for, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of 10 year old Italian bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel stakeholder fears.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos affirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is at the forefront of the markets, while the elections are held on Sunday in the country.
The spread of the 10-year bond gap between Germany and Spain has reached a new higher history.
Pending the growth figures of the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, which was driven by household consumption.
However, the Insee has reduced the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth most worrying economists.
Germany grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an electoral meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the role of nuclear power.
The debate will be successful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
As we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to tackle the reduction of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, not to mention the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate deregulation, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
It is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which simply intends to build only last generation power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by taking up the construction of a plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality runs counter to the discourse.
Berlin's choice will result in the increase in electricity prices, an energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Europe's wind champion, of which he pulls 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; by virtue of which his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an invoice of electricity greater than 40% of that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would illusory the fine declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, as long as they do not show any objection in principle to this energy, the polls show.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of our country has led to the construction of an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very creative of non-removable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual €6 billion of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as the skin of grief.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, no more than there are no diabolical ones.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Security Authority which exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power stations as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequence.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two unparalleled natural disasters that have killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians willing to build a power plant, the stop to its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to competitors in Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the "emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominated such a decisive debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various ways - aggravation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "human rights countries".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed in the economic angle.
There is quite a broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be harmed towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is singing banality, saying that co-development will help solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral pay; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book that synthesizes the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are likely to replace national workers, particularly those with low qualifications, with downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, most of whom are trades in sectors where there is a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A Positive Impact on Wages
In the same way as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows results in an increase between 0.6% and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant reaching the age of 30 will make a net contribution (receiving less expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the term, to go looking for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, but it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented him in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that it would be enough for democracy to triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner.
We know, since Napoleon the "Small One", that this was a facility of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this respect, the paleondy of the true Greek referendum will have had the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overtaken.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and for many of them the Republican soldiers are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in order.
A white seing with the absolute European monarch or a foot jump in the void of the nationalist replies: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutlery, but a common exercise, of full right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no more crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can't stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the diktats of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the pilotage of the European project.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free up markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from crisis will entail decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except, of course, leading us to disaster.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Husband.
But thinking it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"No contact" smart cards are generalized
The world show of the smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart office.
The most important segment is contact-free technology that allows you to pay for public transportation or to settle your purchases by simply approaching a player's card.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent close to 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long after the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for uncontacted payment.
Some 26 million Visa banking cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without Visa contact have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double cheeks.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million MasterCard Passes without contact.
To move up speed, banks need now to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have committed themselves to systematically disseminating their customers' bank cards for the homeless in the future," announced Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real boom next year."
"We are selling 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Farm Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case authorizing payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Company General, too, said yesterday to prepare for the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further explanation.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have brought to light the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their rapists during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the wreckage of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's a breakthrough, but it's probably necessary to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and speeches or in his operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and invoiced as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, therefore has pressured Abuja to take into account Boko Haram's problems.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninterested illumined illuminants.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haousa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the northern Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia while its activists engage in the struggle against the impious central government.
The latter are initially targeted at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as in his habit, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
So the cult is going to radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took over the securityized police headquarters during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now worrying all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe that.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the tonitruant declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsatisfied - ran away.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed in the race for the appointment of the "Great Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Whether it should involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China of Obama and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to strangle himself in the face of an attitude that "flates" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he has fanfare."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil his obligations vis-à-vis this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge about the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has owned the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight foreign politician.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the too precipitated departure of Iraq's "boys", on its misapprehension in Libya, thus sticking to a low label.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance sheet, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to embezzlement.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia by passing through the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with flash.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the Baltic shores last Tuesday, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, this new pipeline that connects directly under the sea Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte shot together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the west-European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube connecting the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012 to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and in time of this huge building has a victory air.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut down access to western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security from its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has managed to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are highly gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us in an organic way," said François Fillon in inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how political as well as economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-plated steel to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred must have been removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for North Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts throughout its length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but the project leaders resigned while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state corporation settle permanently off their coasts.
"In case of failure, we stop passing the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline is therefore released into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders who planned the welds to get a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the status of the gas pipeline shall be carried out by an underwater robot, drawn by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus operating inside the gas pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, wide of one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, he provides accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without having to undergo any repair.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars from the start, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for twenty years renewable, all the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both tubes.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their expenses, as only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a trademark.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskin wants to restore the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine Carnet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode Mode, based in Milan, decides at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (tope skin), which means a varnished cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
It is far from confidential production in the early years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's difficult to establish a buyer's portrait, because the notebook seduces both businessman and student and professionals.
In Moleskine's image, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, counts almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shopping malls and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the increase of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists display their own books.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand is based on a wide range of media.
A success that has made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Synthegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is even higher than the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adaptive, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled."
" Progress over the past 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" There remains, however, a great deal to be done. "
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before they have access to employment.
Rather, they are older: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria which only complicate the return to employment, and which "constitute the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit workers with disabilities.
That's for objective brakes.
There remains the non-word, the mentality that evolves, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of 1987.
The latest known figures, dated 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We won't go until we write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the moody gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian breeder only has praises to do about it.
"I am very happy about Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," he assures Lillois on his side.
As for the contrast between his club and selection services, "it's a whole, if it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Mixed against Romania Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
However, without ignoring the notion of "pleasing".
The Blues have encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This is necessarily part of further strengthening the "participating" character of this meeting.
As far as in front of him, "there's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he raps.
"We've crossed each other before."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With good fortune, Leekens has for his part referred to "the truth."
"Faith" to argue "a gala game."
"Fierty" also shows - as a "voisin" - that France has "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a job of thunder," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be fine to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be aware of this during the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimism its barrier back to Bosnia (22h00) on Tuesday in Lisbon.
By the way, the two teams had no realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been holding since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to play.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it would seem obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we have not scored goals outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should be there as hot, even if the party clearly announces "very tight", said a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced we can take the lead," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012," however relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
No one reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we have not scored a goal on the outside," Regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
