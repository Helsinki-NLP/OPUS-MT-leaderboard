The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned to "make the figure of the clowns"
Some members of the House are dismayed at the proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal came out as a consequence of the programmes to change the name of the assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the House of the whole political arena are concerned that this sounds ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "he can stay with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means cretin and pwp means poop.
A member of the Paid Assembly said that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party claimed to be "open" to change the name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is rendered in a manner similar to the English pronouncement of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drafting amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on possible descriptors of what members of the Assembly will of course be called will be a matter of debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw broad support for the possibility of calling the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could be a scratch for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further amendments to the operation of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name in "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular vote has been organized in an attempt to put an end to a dispute in progress for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he will not take the result of the vote into consideration.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, state that the change of name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shut up while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner in the past," said Adams.
"There's no one here today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood lounges that people attend regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return where they have started."
The churches, added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings is white," he says, "and for this reason they will hurry the moment when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move in these apartments will become a member of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black district - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The early white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of 125th Street retailers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called him differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a colored musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to a larger carillon at the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese "sought to discharge costs" on the parish assembly although it had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark makes a tredicene diving lobster fishing in California
Official sources declare that Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was diving in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was diving with friends Saturday morning when he heard a guy screaming and swam up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought in the beginning that it was only enthusiasm for catching a lobster but then "he understood that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire clavicle was lacerated," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Capt. Larry Giles said during a media release that a few weeks earlier a shark had been sighted in the area, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the chest.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans a boost to the beauty sector in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important push towards the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty product market, which continues to grow while sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decrease, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in several stores next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use the space on the shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and articles for the house.
Sainsbury's said it would have doubled the size of its beauty items up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essee, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique make-up so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the dealer of perfumes The Fragrance Shop will try the authorizations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a shift towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to engage more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points will be more and more similar to the department stores while the supermarket chain tries to oppose resistance to discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's introduced the Argos sales outlets into hundreds of shops and has also introduced different Habitats since it acquired the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to restore enamel to its departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago his pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sale to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of a wide range of luxury brands of leather care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby marches through an agreement of 11 million pounds
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones is furious after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with her trend brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of Truly homes and accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This Morning, 37-year-old presenter, used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their profitable trend-branding activity at the last minute to focus on his outstanding new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the gold girl on TV admitted during a tight meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million pounds - did not leave her enough time to dedicate herself to their brand of housewives and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it had been calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be his long-term future that would have engaged her for the next 20 years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters of Marlow, ready to be sold."
The experts believe that abandoning this morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions because of the strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
Couples spent their holidays together and Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
She joked about the criticism she would have received from the media to comment that some would have considered "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telejournal conductor".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe a "equivalent response" from the US to the first North Korean disarmament operations.
Instead, he pointed out, the US is continuing to impose sanctions to keep the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving great results," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great report."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded camp, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement for the activation of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the national agency for disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would have been allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continually subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put at the centre of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's branded infrastructure and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration while preparing for the re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting using machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool resembles against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at 89th Saturday minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a ride from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 25 metres from Chelsea Gate, with his team down to 1-0.
He touched the left ball before he pulled the second pole.
The attempt went high over the picture of the door as it turned to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga in the net.
"It was enough to try to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I gave a touch and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Blue's midfielder went from heel to Mateo Kovacic before skitting away near the midfielder and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick transition to half-field.
So he performed a beautiful passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left-wing goal beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the roundabout phase of the Champions League at 15.00 Wednesday at St Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face the Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 15.00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, said Sunday morning the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters.
Many people were reported trapped among the rubble of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake which hit the country on Friday and which generated waves up to 6 metres high, reported the spokesperson for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been sprinkled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police invited people who might have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street at Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular to taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on Dashcam, to contact us because we may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the scene of the incident this morning.
Investigations are under way and the police have said that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his apartment but he has been told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what happened.
The residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible."
At 14.00 two police vans were located inside the bounded area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the delimited area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rescription of history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "leaf" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became an objective.
The iconoclasty during the British civil wars was not ordered or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament by external pressure, in his case of course of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historic debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle XVII century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing a part of this fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer pig bangs a Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-western China on the basis of news broadcast by local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a recessed artery, covered in blood near a pig at the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had travelled with his cousin from the bordering Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood on the snout.
A forensic analysis confirmed that 250 kg pig had broken the farmer, according to the statements.
"The legs of my cousin were covered in blood and maciullate," said the cousin named "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a repayment for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of human attacks by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive out the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa's strucchi will bring strong rains to the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing her strength as she moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and to the south-western coast of the USA in the next few days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a loot is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. While Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north into the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
So, tropical humidity in contact with the approaching looting will create heavy and vast rainfalls in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, flows of debris and possible breakages in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in the southern Nevada and Arizona areas.
Rainfalls of 2.5-10 cm are expected in some areas of the south-west, in particular on most of Arizona.
Sudden floods may occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and the storms will bring wind to suffocate and raise dust.
The approaching loot will cause strong rains at local level on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfalls of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will come down to the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations in the temperatures on the USA while the Arctic cools down, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to important changes in temperature over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected a warm early October for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east.
New York can be reached 26 degrees Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the successful deposition by the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turn Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into charges.
Ford informed the Justice Commission of the Senate that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh blinked at her in a state of drunkenness and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20,4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it is a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day's audience, Nielsen announced.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken over by CNN and CBS operators Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He kept his eyes low for several minutes while being reproved and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?
He was told "Lei has power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say during the committee's hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's appointment to the entire Senate for one vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyse the charges against the candidate during the next week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his programmes of letting the European Union "make politics" with the future of Britain and endangers the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrest the suspect of the LSU Dyteon Simpson player's death
Police arrested one of Wayde Sims' gunshot suspects, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and brought to prison on charges of second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated with CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said the suspect admitted that he had accidentally shot Wayde.
The security was set at $350,000, the defense attorney announced.
East Baton Rouge's legal office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task-force for the fugitives of the Louisiana State police, the police science laboratory, Southern University police and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The Athletic Director of the LSU thanked the local law enforcement forces for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "stunned" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Vulcan ash sprinkles Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and there had been 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rhombs and shocks.
Images of social media have shown thin layers of ash covering the windshield of cars in Mexico City neighbourhoods like Xochimillco.
Geophysics have found an increase in activity in correspondence to the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) to the south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 affected the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot teams and thousands joined in demonstrations of opponents to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the riot police targeted the cops with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There have been further collisions during the day with police officers who have used their sleeves to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" compared themselves with the demonstration unionists who cried "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for mild injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independence region one year after the 1 October referendum considered illegal by the government of Madrid but recognized by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx was low, and the Catalans against the secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police had tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place near seats throughout the region.
The independence groups had piled up on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that she had no longer hoped that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping joyfully for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory, although measured at the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered a police-supported protest with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is becoming more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after a home with cars
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry house.
The accident occurred at Ballinagagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a bullet at some point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston marked the victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers amazed by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team moved on to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team will therefore remain without an out-of-home victory in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday the first Hearts, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston continues its series of victories in the division remaining unbeatable for six games, with Coach Holt who has yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunity against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson collapsed but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's head blow from the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put the visitors with kicks in difficulty.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers granted a punishment kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to move to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal-stopping attempt at the feet of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot out of another Livingston game pattern.
The cross occurred in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigor, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's substitute and one by hand failure, were rejected.
A "female" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their game style and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the maximum series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to sprung the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense in charge of a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were little inspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerard, in this case they fell well below these standards.
The last passage was missing - only once they were able to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are half-ranked.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September) during the lunch meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan to relax relations between NATO allies.
There have been clashes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police motivated with security reasons the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters came in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Dectford Road Impact: cyclist dies in confrontation with a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road in the south-eastern part of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The incident took place months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder in the male prison for maximum security, the prison office reported.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin's male maximum security prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized agents "Back" have been employed to manage the tumult, involving eight prisoners and is confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on site for mild facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "A specially trained prison person has been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
The Long Lartin prison is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, the anti-smooth agents were called to intervene in the prison to sedate a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa cross the south-west of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already released warnings of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona up to South and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday in the evening with rain.
Phoenix National Weather Service reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricane include precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas foreign to the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be positive as the south-west is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the drought monitoring centre, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
Initially, the route of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land on the mainland through Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who still maintained the force of hurricane Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect precipitation between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, thus heading through Arizona and to southern Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or by his strishes is intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-western area of Sonora and in the south-western desert area of the USA," the National Center for Hurricanes announced.
These rains are expected to generate sudden floods potentially lethal and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton's assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, told Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have taken back with the mobile phone what has happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered for wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered for the mischief and anger" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh handed over to Congress on Thursday, denying in a passionate and decisive manner the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed for the hearing, defending himself against the charge.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the minds of the most expert right of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented precedents in public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of the republican influence at midterm elections.
"To five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really need to do it," he said.
"For this lot strenuously for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "resist and hinder."
The first fundamental procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected no later than Friday, according to what a senior assistant to the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that fell down on the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach in the twilight, sweeping away many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and they did not immediately run away, thus turning into victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged with it cars, logs, houses, hit anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/hour (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Airborne photographs published by the calamity agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, contorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the heavy earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have strengthened the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and claimed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "are totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the time when the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you feel a man on a top floor of a building yelling agitated way to alert the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell down on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced people still need food and other necessities.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for the tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff managed to reach the city of Palu healthy and safe, where the employees took refuge under shelters of waxed canvas in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they met scenes of devastation, said Doseva.
"I've been told I've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups have started the difficult operations to start the rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations provide that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the scattered still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from an exhaust.
Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding team's prep, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the scattered paragliding drivers.
Other people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I'm carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the broadcast of news related to the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of a gray spring instead of two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thiefs steal $26,750 during a refueling of ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, following a press release by the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver was emptying a ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver more money, said investigator Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "sucked out behind the employee of Brink" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the act.
Anyone with information on the identities of offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name in Ye
rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When announcing the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been named Ye for a long time and has used his nickname as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change took place before his participation in the Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaced the program with the singer Ariana Grande, who deleted her participation in "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains for him a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We passed from Kanye, which means the only, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our badness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than the reflection of who we are."
He's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without dash and capital letters.
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against the civilian population, on the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were taking their feet throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by extending monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities drive young people to criminal gangs.
The USA should double funding for the IA
While China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double research funds in this field, says AI Kai-Fu Lee's investor and operator, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several U.S. government groups about AI, although in the USA in general a formal AI strategy is lacking.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be the country #1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Redouble the budget in the search for IA would be a good start considering that all other countries are much lower than the USA and we need a new revolution in IA," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major success in the AI sector being achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publishing house Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and was subsequently a leader at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous technology competitions from the US government such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when to hold the next one, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking leaders away from academia, it's multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the framework of AI.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to the doctorates in AI," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Commission for the Security of Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the name of the country in the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece which blocked its demands for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but the nationalist opponents believe that change would damage the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia by a majority of Slav.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote for the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the influx will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the referendum's validity.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and the EU's accession and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, told Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in the statement.
The State Election Commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," declared Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter of the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and the European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov was preparing a small stage and settling the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head up, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirm of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required influx.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees expected to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it was established in May last year.
Guarda: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dealt with the Brighton defense during the 2-0 match from Manchester City Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy to mark his mark at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a mid-field shift at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapults into the free field.
Aguero then found himself encircled by four green meshes.
He humiliated a defender before exceeding several others at the limit of the Brighton area.
He then made a passage to the left, where he found Sterling.
The British attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's doorman with a right-hand shot into the net.
"Aguero is having trouble at foot," said the city coach Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to score at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal arrived at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball off the net just before he left the camp.
The City will fight against Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a rematch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday night, but still hope to get their title in first division.
"Even if we play without goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the top of this year.
And why shouldn't I want to race?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but it is said that they are inclined to let Scherzer launch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal Sunday of rest.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump to a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the influx of Republicans during the midterm elections.
"All we've done is put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really trying to do this for excellent candidates," she said.
Trump continued by saying: "We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see badness, pettyness.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to storm so they can regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resist and hinder."
"And it's been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "crazy, bad, mean, and lying."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering strong whistles among the public.
"Remember his answer?
Did you get the document scrambled?
Um, uh, thing.
No, um no, I'm waiting for a - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom I have been informed that they are not welcome, and all because they have said what they thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, all arguments ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
However, today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if ever it has been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the labor party and every opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or not to party leadership.
All this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought of sharing a similar political vision began to expect an reversal of the trend on my part and that I would take positions I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow insults about social media who ask for my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center and telling me that I shouldn't be part of the labor party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues because the comments I am making tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of insults at a sexist or racist background every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every distrust motion or modification of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given many advices, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my views so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that's not what I got into politics to do.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the inquire of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councilor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have remained in any way shocked by my political positions and by the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm the family, the companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those who I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeatable Ayr scales the ranking
Two late attempts might in some way have highlighted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the rank, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their boldness, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I have to be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We need to recognize the merit of Ayr, they have better exploited the opportunities of us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, right in half time, to score and then convert a target by itself to bring the Ayr to 17-5 to the interval.
But the Melrose began well the second time and the goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was put out, and on restart, the Ayr is released again in advantage thanks to a goal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The deputy captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson therefore received a yellow sign and Melrose made the man pay extra with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without a ball, with the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advanced mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the restart, after Rowe had collected football from the area of David Armstrong and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to seek the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game Star is looking for a new career in catering
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after the discovery of being appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which writes and plays together with Greg Hemphill's long-standing partner.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make statements, although a source of Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "problem food trade" of Glasgow."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia without outlet to the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval headquarters lined with sartiame in La Paz.
Public buildings exhibit a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the river of the Amazzoni are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, without outlet to the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the nineteenth century is still alive, as is the desire to once again travel the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
" Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of competence of the State.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for the reelection next year - has a lot to dance with the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would hardly change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has flabbergasted any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to continue discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly quick.
On Monday Bolivia will be able to "govern extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political scamotage.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons if it will not be able to trust Washington before.
He spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intent on restarting diplomatic talks in standstill after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It explains that it is an "illusion" that the continuation of sanctions and US opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington broadcasts the statement without Pyongyang first carrying out important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows have the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high-fashion shop near you
If you want to extend your collection of caps or completely block the rays of the sun, do not look further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers have unveiled a series of crazy oversized covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been furious on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their captivating creations on the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included anguria, a witch hat and even a pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewn lips and seem more to a representation of Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One creation resembled a complete dive with masks and eyeglasses, while another looked like a loose iced cone.
And if you go on with the huge declarations of style, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that the huge caps could reach you on the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the edge of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a stretch more than a meter wide that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very little practical hat that invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the walkway: a beach bag in large straw almost as the model in costume that brings it.
The bag in raffia orange burned, finished with raspberries and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has achieved such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and required subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on the English only if we want to build trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest percentages of success within the independent schools.
68% of pupils who have studied foreign languages have received the most votes.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of the students received the highest vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
At present, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons that employees have indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a survey of YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to be able to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a valid employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the specialized teaching staff in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible at this time to deny, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and that must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative powers."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers Mike Trudell's reporter tweeted that probably James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six-game Lakers pre-game program.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare myself," he said.
The time of gathering a Trump West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from early tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia to a raffle of raffles.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation pending for his choice to cover the vacant seat at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress at the November elections.
What time will Trump's launch be and how is it possible to follow him online?
Trump's debut at Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's debut in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became thesis due to the accusations of sexual violence with an early vote of confirmation of the Senate pending for a week while the FBI conducts the investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the elections in November to get a little push.
So, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies over the next week are aimed at "energying volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority who hold the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel in as many states as possible while we are in the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for the Wheeling Wesbanco Arena, tonight's event could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is queued in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him into the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist, at Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive up to Sunday's singles
After three single-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motorcycle of the oscillating pendulum is a totally invented sport concept in which players believe firmly and never as in races like these.
Where's the bike now, then?
"They had an advantage of six points and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of bike," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, ahead of four points with twelve others at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth was spieted from tea to green and is setting an example.
The celebration screams became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the scores to match the four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at the 15th hole was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really need to put it all on your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple in Europe is four by four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the chalky crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would be no more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun rises on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was in partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes plunged Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they couldn't even climb away.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and do not give and for the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained an important advantage on the final day, but this session of ants has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the Saturday football and foursome games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to preserve the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning furballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has resisted more in the ants, winning two games, but they have failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points of row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second couple to win four points from the four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they worked superbly to beat down a stunned Woods and American exordinant Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5&4.
Woods, who dragged for two games on Saturday, showed occasional genius shots but lost 19 of his 29 games in the four-balls and four-flies and seven-row games.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's football, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the expected results in a pleasant and ventilated day in south-west Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points Saturday.
They won a gritty 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the furballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the ants, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point waste by passing to the individual, though as the owner, the Furyk team only needs a match to defend the trophy.
After having been the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolute rejection of unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated on Saturday to the UN that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country's distrust in the USA, that in such circumstances he would have refused to unilaterally renounce his nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said on the occasion of the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has adopted "important measures of good will" during last year, such as the stop to nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see, however, any consistent response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no security in our national security and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first."
Although Ri has re-used the complaints concerning Washington's resistance to "staged" denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because it did not in all reject unilateral denuclearization as already done in the past by Pyongyang.
He referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a U.S. President-in-Office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards the "Korean peninsula denuclearization", while Trump promised guarantees of North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The USA insists on the need to "first have a denuclearisation" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even oppose the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
He did not refer to programmes for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the leader of the USA had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister underlined the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the counterpart of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he claimed that it was inevitable to target the US territory with North Korea missiles after Trump called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, who had threatened to "destroy" North Korea completely last year, praised Kim for his courage in undertaking disarmament, but said that much more needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea's denuclearization.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
Cine and Russia state that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "Respect for the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exception until full, final and ascertained denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's sanctions control in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri at the margin of the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit again Pyongyang the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of having filed "gangster demands."
North Korea had engaged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US had adopted "conforming measures."
He said that Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to in Singapore and actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to contrast the growing virile culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
A university scholar has found that the students of the number one university in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the USA.
He had the idea to start the course after a conference that had given the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I only told this now, when I am in the last year?'
He said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course provides for a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice of smoking cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and with a sleep of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid fattening because the lack of sleep brings the brain into mode of inedia, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar curriculum before joining this competitive institute.
Prof Czeisler advised students to set up an alarm clock for when they have to go to bed, as well as for when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send in tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first win out of the home from the February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches by coach leaving his team at eight points from the fleeing leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a formation of the Rangers short of inspiration never seemed able to match.
While the Ranger now descends to the sixth place, Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
And there could be further problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown out of the house.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which quickly passed the Ayr in the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that ripped out a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team choked their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated for ball possession but Livingston better exploited the balls at its disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when the filtering passage of Menga in the first time sent Scott Pittman ahead to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but it seemed there was more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to see himself assigning a rigor at the end of the 15th following a clash with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the door in the first time but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about the blow of Lassana Coulibaly's head and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livingston opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he even deserved it for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an impact almost immediate since the wing stuck a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself out of the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett gathering a long ball after each other.
Holt's team might have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton made one last request for rigor after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson denied it again.
Almanacco: the inventor of the meter Geiger
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGIO continues... the day when the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that has made the device known as a Geiger counter.
A turning point in science since then, the meter Geiger has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those little credible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you can really feel the effects of atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me a little it's just bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days from his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
Therefore, they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then reinjected.
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovary cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colon-retch, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whipped into the studio during a Saturday Night Live bet after an unconcluded performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would stand for office in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA beret, he started a rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often speak to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a screenplay whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star took on the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission against the accusations of sexual violence filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West Filippica's recording was uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get West around with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad time in the backstage because of his cap.
"I got bullied in the backstage.
They told me ‘don’t go out with that hat on.’
They boiled me!
And so they told me I'm an outcast," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see the place submerged?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's blanket because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, said Variety, with a person who told the newspaper: "The study dropped a mortal silence."
West had been invited as a substitute for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West has received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANKS TO TAKE TEST TO THE MASS."
But the director of the Karen Hunter show tweeted that West was simply "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (purchasing his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embracing a vomitable ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, called himself Snoop Lion and of course the lost musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted felony murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused must appear at Belfast's prison on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Sword Throne star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Spade.
But actor 31-year-old attacked the stereotype of the male hero, asserting that these on-screen floors often make kids believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old Trojan co-star of Spade, admitted to worry a lot about this problem.
'Personally I worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are looking at now?'
Kit believes that television could partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this certain way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequel or sequel of Throne of Spade once finished the series next summer, affirming "to have finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Throne of Spade.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, Kit's character, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people suffer from these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to what the Chinese health authorities said during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual HIV transmission is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the traditional values of the country, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual relations within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff had the GOP senator's data pierced, and talks about "dangerous moods" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. MP denounced charges against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information by three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The L.A.'s Democratic MEP said that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the "outside-right wing".
"Buggie, lies and still despicable lies" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a committee of experts on the accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts has been associated with the Waters office and have issued information regarding a member of the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been put at risk as a result of these false and biased accusations, has in no way been responsible for the escape of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' claim has quickly generated online criticisms from the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This nonsense is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that you do not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone gets accused of something he didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the defendant's reasons.
You must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a running Republican candidate for disposing of Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's huge if confirmed," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office has alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement forces of these tending claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny's Review English strikes again - the parody of the spy with a undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back alive in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
The veiled autonomy on the subject of how gross we do will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for the countries of non-English-speaking filmmakers.
Of course it is the foolish secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamorous has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme of Gloria's moments of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games of London 2012.
It is a character based initially on the traveler and mysterious international man who once Atkinson interpreted Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who approaches the helicopter by wearing a medieval armor and the propellers snap briefly against his helm.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that "seri" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seems to be directed at children rather than adults and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of immutable topicality is now the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the British spy supersecret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the exhaustion of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that causes the vessel to overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a stumbling block of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this character simil-Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisor informs you that every single active spy has been compromised and will have to call someone already retired.
And that means that the damn Johnny English, who now works as a school manager in a chic establishment, but who also teaches in an informal way about how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a school of Rock spying course.
English is released in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role as a girl of the high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the billionaire charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the leftist Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; unleash hell by sneaking underground into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to pick up the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as smart and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And how did it happen with the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, even though they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings made with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to incline the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day day was endorsed by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The announcement of a revision of the political line is expected by the end of the year."
"It will not happen from one day to the next, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy in favour of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support a similar idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is currently not the subject of discussion."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless leaders" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviour considered illegal.
It has also confirmed plans to include employees in business boards and to create funds for inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10% of the private sector's net assets to employees, who end up putting in annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised doubt whether or not the findings of the government agency could influence some of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible for the FBI to bring to light something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that as I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that she came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, and unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she names couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the performance of a remarkable ring of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: ending poverty in the world.
Arrived at the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, in fact, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now that it remains 12 years to achieve its intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way of persuading people to request an appeal for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktivism"- people who really feel that they're making a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported having recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, working for a lot of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to call on world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, intended to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than $2.25 billion people.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, of which they have already been disbursed or used as funds at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executors based in the UK, committed to "helping children grow to the fullest of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after having received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can ensure that social injustice or malnutrition becomes a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK have been implemented because better nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favour of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, which asked, "What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we frame and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement a "block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of Interior
Washington can, if necessary, use its Navy to prevent Russian sources of energy from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern core of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the defendants to the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make financial leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "slightly versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its natural liquid gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that is absolutely the most economical for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of North Stream 2, a "unappropriate" gas pipeline project that Trump said made Moscow's "prisoner" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly highlighted that the North Stream 2, gassed by 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of merely economic nature.
The Cremlin objected that Washington's fervent opposition to the project was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary for Energy of the United States.
The position taken by the United States triggered Germany's negative reaction, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to remain outside the EU's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a major problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of running for the presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will take "serious consideration" of running for president following mid-term elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could apply.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
During the city assembly Warren said his on President Donald Trump, stating that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that there's a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters themselves do not believe that they are expected to run in 2020.
58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
32% supported such an application.
The survey gave rise to increased support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 percent in contrast.
Other names of high profile democrats discussed for potential candidacy in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and the senator of the Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he will take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he is back, I can put him in touch with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers get back with," he told the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their comrades soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a friendly memoir curiae in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions appeal presented by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her violent sons gang members" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was put on hold in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States has reversed a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to submit an asylum application to immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be judged on the basis of particular circumstances and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says amicus curiae.
In their memory, the prosecutors also objected that the policy that bans the entry of immigrants harms the economy of the United States, asserting the clear probability that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts no longer to provide asylum for victims who escaped from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Ail is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecutions or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or for a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been designed to mitigate any problem -- even all serious problems -- that people have to face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover to Palu while the dead balance doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said mother 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish little boy in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At any moment there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, robbing among their frieque personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquakes, were strangled.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, victim of a fracture and back, rested outside the Military Hospital of Palu, where the patients were treated outside because of the continued strong shocks of assist.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the sensation of the violent earthquake shaking the room that shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "pretending" with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper, advertising the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
United States Last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in Iowa state - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections has highlighted what U.S. officials have reported to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington-based escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war had been designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, as the Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and previously long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those prepowers by publishing advertisements on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the newsstand on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese population might have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm fist of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's biggest newspaper names has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he has not stated that it is a newspaper.
Republicans are alienating female voters before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various sexual harassment charges, analysts have indicated that a negative reaction will be seen, especially by women, during the future mid-term elections.
The unrest in this respect has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially demonstrated that they want to continue with a vote.
"You cannot withdraw these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November", said Friday, according to Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to proceed with the candidacy of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats are going to the stars," he said at the news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the indecisive electricians of the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite not agreeing to the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his accusations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it has become a messy ensemble," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, according to NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"We are not only talking about the vote for the committee, about the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim that they have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, in front of the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted her in the Jewish state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitalia during a celebration during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that comes from Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent hidden behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is completely at the choice of the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely out of place from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be rewarded with a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificically symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under heavy fire from the field and war machines".
Then he rushed towards the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" made the line advance before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be up to and something that makes me more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt truly honoured to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given him by many people".
MMA fans stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 just then to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including the six on the main card, and had to be broadcast in the UK at night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the UK were stumped when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some remained grounded after being awake until the early hours of the morning especially for fighting.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government regulation provides that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move on to programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for transmission.
"Peppa il pig," "yes."
"The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we tried to get so much for the fans, and we just discussed it.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize, until he got to high school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Desert Island Discs by Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that having become a parent meant that he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-time program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up because "he was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and of feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and the energy to be successful."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they had by chance discovered his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high profile LGBT activist and has used his face in this year's Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time World Champion said that the fact of falling in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "has caught me in surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who's 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed so many in young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be around here so I could be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed for my whole life - swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still makes him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside form Mickelson put in the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will score a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth time since his record, was set up by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleader-making and working on his own game in the ranks, hoping to correct what torments him.
Since he has never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected route regularly punishes the wrong hits.
And if the path itself wasn't encouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the careful champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 single games, start with a hot start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he will be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went and that's the way we thought it was going.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will outrun Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
He could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never even closely reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winning matches, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, argut, he likes to play people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that younger players have had fun fighting him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did much more than play"
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a uncomfortable ride.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 meeting in Valderrama, where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I continued to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but only recently," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"So it will be history to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
We've got to give it our best shot tomorrow.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the dots are marked in the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players in my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy how his team competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have gotten over it.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to get out the best of you.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and get the best of himself out."
Unlike Bjorn, the counterpart Jim Furyk will seek in its players the best individual performance more than team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those great meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the middle games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys as we think it appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German military navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the cold war, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and an impennade of costs.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the Admiral of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the military navy in 2014, but worrying issues following delivery have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Military Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class ships.
They will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as it should be possible to use new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays imply that the innovative warships, which is said to allow Germany to project its power oversea, will already become obsolete when they enter service, notes the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 frigate reported last year, when the German military navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have noticed a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that have made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship weighs heavily, and this reduces its performance and limits the military Navy's ability to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from bad hardware, also the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from the initials EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involved in the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military navy actually "scarse of ships capable of being employed".
The official stated that the issue has deteriorated considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could join the military navy.
The National Trust watches over the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use vision to obtain food.
It is hoped that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown earring and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with the use of portable detectors.
Analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of callbacks of bats and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, advisor for nature protection for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and how to keep the best forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Bats are at risk due to the construction and development work that affects trespolis and ruins the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the truces and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization has even established the first reserve of Scotland intended only for bats at the estate of Threave, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, claims that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Threave we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us to understand more about their growth needs."
He stressed the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trespolus could kill up to 400 females and children, possibly sweeping away an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their tresples.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how they pass on their populations."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while the lawmen sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape charges against him as "false news," claiming that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His legal staff are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
In addition, Der Spiegel announced on Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about what happened.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, stunned the statements as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Golden Balloon turned towards the camera.
"They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's law enforcement officials are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on charges, called "an inadmissible report of suspicions on the private sphere".
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will claim compensation for " moral damages in the measure corresponding to the gravity of the breach of privacy, probably considered one of the most serious of the personal rights of recent years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the footballer's room, where he subjected him to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga maintains that Ronaldo would kneel after the event saying that he was "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
From the documents it emerges that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mr Mayorga also stated that he had gone to the police and hospital, where his injuries were photographed, but that he had subsequently agreed to a conciliation agreement because he felt "terroristd by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "coming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the agreement, claiming that she is still being traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer he will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "could regret forever" the loss of its world leader status in car construction following Brexit, said Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "concerned" about the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about the possible exit of Great Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting momentary blockage of production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese motor home claims that delays at borders, in the case of an agreed Brexit, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota General Manager at Burnaston.
It increases concern among other British car manufacturers for exit from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the concept of "just in time", with parts that arrive every 37 minutes by British and European suppliers for ordering cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "designed precisely to avoid these border disturbances".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
"The test, not only by Toyota but also by other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, over the long term, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are strongly concerned: "According to my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated".
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Justice Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "remanded for a week," while continuing the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh, declared the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference with the elections, the links between Trump's councillors and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and rumored that he was about to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting was announced on Wednesday with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Commission's hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
Friday, Trump ordered a week of instruction from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's final vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not been established a date, it could be this week, I imagine it will be delayed another week considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists may challenge this statement: Sanders has not held a briefing with the press at the White House since September 10.
The conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings is not due to an adversion for television journalists "that they show themselves," although he said, "I'm not dissatisfied with the fact that they show themselves."
So he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president holds several Question sessions and answers from any president before him," he said, adding without citing the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
Let us try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you will be able to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president may have shown the reason, making a free-wheel talk, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
Minister for Health writes to European NHS Scottish workers to express their concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scotland NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance from the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of requests for settled status (stabilly resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "Over the summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Members from across the EU, not only, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly hope you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was urgently operated following a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having brought a head wound in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31 to 27, as Mike Organ of The Tennessee reported.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told journalists that the accident that caused the wound took place just before the interval.
"He approached and passed out on board," Reed said.
The first aid and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on boardcamp, before putting it in a stretcher and taking it away for further verification.
A Tennessee State executive reported to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no information on the type and extent of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with the Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five pranks before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 pranks.
Foreign purchasers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new business plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, will announce Theresa May today.
The effort will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise to provide more affordable accommodation and higher incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat homeless people.
The overrun, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and real estate buy to lets (purchased to be rented), could constitute more than 3%.
The Treasury Ministry expects that the maneuver can collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first home in the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a cut on the stamp tax to help the younger ones by buying the first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by taking land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up allowances on affordable housing to settle the British "real estate disgrace".
Mr Corbyn announced a striking series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including rent controls and the removal of unguilty evictions.
He also wants to give the board more powers on the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would have committed myself to restoring the British dream, namely that life should be better for new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not reside in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for resident British workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My maximum aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's technical director, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become a Scottish manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is attracted by the challenge of raising the North-East team currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after being led by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in series B and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportssound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors in the direction of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of Alloa Athletic claims not to feel any anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"Success for me right now is measured with the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it definitely belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back together."
The start of Ross's career as manager dates back to three years ago, after a period as coaching assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a heart coach replacement.
He then helped the Alloa to save themselves from the retrocession to the third level and led St. Mirren from the edge of the retrocession to the championship title, the next season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It was probably a turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
"I really believed that the role of manager was made for me, more than that of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I earned a living and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with weekly.
I am still dealing with you in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much quieter than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has led to greater incuses to English pubs in difficulty and more concern to catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 percent to July, while restaurant collections have dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put the data together and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England at the World Cup made it possible for July to follow a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The 1.8 percent collapse in the catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink most have been the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the decrease of the restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not excessively like the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go outside and drink something.
In pubs and bars managed sales of drinks rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while consumption of foods fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, RSM's recreational and receptionist, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of the main social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a drop in sales of 4.8% annually will be particularly serious in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse time for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, of which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce".
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent to July, reflecting the decline of brands’ roll-outs.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for British pubs, bars and restaurants puts together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the industry reference company.
One in five children has secret social network accounts that hides from parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some only 11 years old, owns secret social network accounts that hides parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake on Instagram" pages.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
20% of students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One in five children, some only 11 years old, creates accounts of social networks that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a "primary" account that was cleaned up to show their parents, while keeping a private one.
A mother who discovered by chance the secret site of daughter 13-year-old found a teenager who urged others to "suppress me".
The research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmisterses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, has shown that 40% of boys between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to hold private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" to the Council of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of the light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys deep respect from the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could gain a huge advantage by bringing it to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I can't wait to act as athletes' voice and I hope I can help and help drive sport in Scotland."
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently a BBC opinionist, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors only time could have told me if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a great job but I took it all back, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!".
Advertising a tyrella puts mothers and cows in comparison and divides opinion online
A company producing a tyrellatte has divided opinion on the net with an advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed and cows who are mountaineering.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and wearable t-shirt of the world", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express herself as mothers given by the new t-t-t-shirt.
Four real mothers dance in a barn of cows on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I take the milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these are not boobs but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Take him out, take him out, feed the children, take him out, take him out, take the milk to my lords."
However, the advertising, published on the company's Facebook pages, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different reactions among the viewers, many of whom argued that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must also be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for the fact that their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie t-shirt is discreetly worn under a bra for mothers
Someone else commented, "Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a mother's t-shirt that will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really nonsense advertising."
Others have defended him and a woman has even admitted to find the "fun" song.
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I wish I had one.
When I was using the t-shirt, I felt like a cow.
Publicity is a little hindrance, but it's not far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use tyrants (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "cows".
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet t-shirt in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is based is based on the idea that many women who use tyrella feel like cows.
However, the Elvie tyrellatte is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be placed in a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, hold the children and even go out while they pull the milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD from Mother commented: "The Elvie tyrellatte is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the pulley to the cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pulley is able to assure."
This is not the first time that the Elvie t-shirt has reported.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children presented herself on the designer's walker Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved into a tentacles on the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children has grown exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and political line of Trump administration have made it more difficult to entrust these children.
Most of those who took them into custody were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid to put at risk the possibility of staying in the country offering to take such a step.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken to potential beneficiaries and other adult members of their families and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of themselves.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
In order to try to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to preserve their cause of legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children remain in care, the more they are likely to suffer from anxiety and depression that causes violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, the more so as those who work in reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months say.
Those who support this position say that the probability that this occurs is even higher in a large structure like that of Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for the distress signals of children to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges the U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has now reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally with the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without putting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support Syrian Kurdish forces and Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are in favour of their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting unfounded fears" that drive refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicised."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be allocated in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack on Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem has nevertheless stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action will target jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, who will "be uprooted".
The envoy of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene a new committee of government and opposition members in order to draft a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem has set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work must be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
'Cause Trump's gonna make the second term.
On the basis of this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators might hope, his presidency should not end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of the spectators bending.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening are more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first night, definitely increasing compared to 1.7 million of four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program exceeded the percentages of the network by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something explainable," says Neal Baer, a TV showrunner of ABC's "Designed Survivor" who tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television programme, the plot of the events in Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
Stopping to follow the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give themselves.
And yet it goes well beyond its duty of informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing in-depth research of Bob Woodward for his book "Pour", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a tracheal garment" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, will no longer be able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what it does looks like a reality show is that every night there's news" says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the advent of actors and the daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. that praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house to watch the MSNBC and meanwhile recorded the CNN.
He failed to get away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and in front of the future uncertainty of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we were once doing all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Inflation of foreign money in the race for the tightest elections of half-mandate
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is an influx of money due to the realignment of a Congressional District that has made two members in office now run for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg brings the democratic representative Conor Lamb to the scene, who took his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th old district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January deliberated that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th district race sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
The political opinionists have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has thought of penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then they have changed their mind
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather friendly meeting took place between the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and the president Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced Trump's executive group to leave.
The officials of the State Department have decided to bring together the heads of the US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert's spokesman in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for controlling drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and homicides.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading into the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus giving up any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of reprimand or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton spokesperson at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who nevertheless wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report he will be publishing, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which seems to be sufficient evidence by now.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collision with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before the voters and perhaps a jury of his own while preparing for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as it is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
On that occasion, we failed by allowing ourselves to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to deal with them differently.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested that Trump be intercepted by questioning his ability to cover the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news about The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the reliable accusations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, at the midterm elections we will vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass this test, democracy will have to prepare itself for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're going to do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she moved to America and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villareal in Spain, would give them great opportunities to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident at the knee, camper Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the Trentune player.
"We have faced the game convinced to do well and we have brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the match is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to achieve the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will be able not to disappoint.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my accidents and changes at club level but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation works well.
We can therefore forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of the respondents from Nationwide say they spoke to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they talked about it with their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate in time what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for the costs.
Engage a financial consultant: you may be advised to pay the expenses you will have to pay.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Name a health care prosecutor so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your elder parent will be taken to the hospital as a matter of urgency.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a question of finances, but who are the doctors?" Martin asks.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Man hit multiple times with a compressed-air gun at Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed-air gun as he was walking back after spending the evening out.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as " Casual Action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in danger anyway, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a very strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victims’ budget is set to rise.
The communications are interrupted and the aid managers have failed to have any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is located near the epicenter of the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi Centrale province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the Sulawesi island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When struck by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called the Pacific fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the earthquakes and the strongest tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December a very strong earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, of which over half of Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that has sprung against the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake struck the regency Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when a connoisseur tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped her phone out of hand.
Palin has been transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and its security has been set at $500, as reported by KTUUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin risks being charged with three first-degree crimes, that is, detention for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged a second-degree felony punishable with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under examination by the Court of Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and the possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the accident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist to the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications network do not work and the victims' budget is set to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit off Sulawesi Centrale, located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media circulate videos showing the time of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks at NYC
New York's federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to rain on a cycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and equally "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued 22 counts of imputation to Saipov, which included eight counts of murder with criminal association, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation," said prosecutors describing how Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, offense and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York pursued the last capital punishment case.
The man mentioned in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers, but in the end he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminated for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The spouses Rosenberg both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that they were proud of what they did in front of the investigators.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 imputations were concerned, he was not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was said to be "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a recognition of guilt and the condemnation of the hergastol without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of Tory parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE must lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore today to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of the Theresa May party suggested that he should deal with the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the Independence Party of the United Kingdom said that politicians must "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be outside Europe" if Farage were the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges May has to face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been underlined by the Tory in favour of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of the Brexit supporters, of those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and the "chaos".
At the start of the organization Leave Means Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting the negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We would be out of Europe by now," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion would change from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the procession and told journalists: "I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who walk the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let us lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the beginning, Farage said that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they were going to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to make the pressure feel to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilise the People's Army of this country who voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against the flags of Brexit after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labourer derided the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus deal, the unattractive borders and the borderless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a sham.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking of running for the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren states that after the November elections she will seriously consider whether to run for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the November re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that Trump could challenge in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled down.
One participant asked her if she would like to apply for the presidency.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix the government and that means that a woman is in the highest position."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana on Saturday reported arresting a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas leaves well leaving Hamilton to defend himself against the attacks of Vettel in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the gang tail, move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the stop the next lap returning to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton however surpasses it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent its passage inside, risking to end up out after a double shift to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then drive the race for most of the race without stopping at the rubber gearboxes and try to quickly finish to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by conquering the fourth place.
In the end, however, you have to make the pit stop at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps you are not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked really well all weekend and was really nice to let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A Bad Example of Body Language
At a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump took over Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence in claiming that she did not reveal the content of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing of attempted rape of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
During a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "mishes, villains and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, petty, bad and lying," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being disclosed and those responsible say "oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer, did you reveal the content of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is clogged by her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did it."
But his denial is not credible to the president, who at the Saturday night's event commented: "I'm telling you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate at the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that the democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the meanness. It doesn’t matter to them who hurt, to those who have to go over to regain power and control,” the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants winning the race back for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately went ahead with two shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the bet before Dwyer brought the Giants back in favor.
Francois Bouchard scored the match for the Dundees before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe that Friday night in Belfast had reassembled and won the game with the Dundees for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 a.m. on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a pretty animated first time, Sullivan brought the home team back to the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the match assist in Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The house team has recompunged and Bouchard has regained the balance after a strategic maneuver at 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to the action of Nielsen who brought the Dundees to the advantage for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who at this point lost four of the last five meetings, will play the next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be acclaimed as a hero after being killed to allow an aircraft carrying hundreds of people to take off by saving them.
More than 800 people died and many are scattered because of a very strong earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues having fled to save their lives, the ventunenne Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri di Palu, which fluctuated furiously.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Syrait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian issuer ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national agency for disaster countermeasures indicates that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it was impossible to reach many others," explains Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman.
High waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where on Sunday a mass burial will be carried out.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mom, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been struck by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after the lagoon accident
The flight airline that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to reports by Air Niugini, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats were able to safely take the other passengers and the crew after the accident while the plane was trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane has been thrown into the lagoon because it has not reached the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low rate.
"Ed was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit at the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to arrange a bridge lent help using a dung to carry people on the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft accidents of the airlines registered with PNG but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
Saturday ended the presentation of evidence of the prosecution in the new trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst of the United States Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used his cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the twenty-nine year old accused Quinton Tellis and the victim nineteen-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered the location data of several mobile phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period when he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to court on Saturday and testified that that day was not in town.
When the public prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that that night was in the Sanford truck, the latter confirmed that he was "lieving because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data, on the other hand, indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages into its tracks.
Bristol's Group The High Breed claims that the hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and do again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Common are recently back in the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York Tat quotes a couple in court for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a tata quoted a couple in court for discriminative dismissal after receiving a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the demand to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER NERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she was not happy with their previous father, an African American, and expected a Filipino.
He paid Ms. Maurice's work day and sent her home with a cab.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, to be dismissed, asked for compensation for the beauty of $350 per day for the six months of full-time work for which she had initially been hired, even if without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday at the Post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that the dismissal of Maurice was the only thing they could do because they feared they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife sent her a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you were rude, even if by mistake?
Your baby boy?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that the wife has been born for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"There can be no contact with a person in this way.
It's not a very kind behavior," added the financial advisor.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has immediately denounced the spouses on social media by harshly criticizing them for their behaviour and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: "It is not easy to get into the shoes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success that Paddington has achieved."
Affirming that the father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book for children inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a little "hate" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you're proud even if it's not your fault.
I think he was interpreting Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say good-bye on the phone to my daughter who was dying.
Upon landing the daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to tell me that he would be dead in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly leaning.
She died a little earlier and it was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay."
In the end Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, grieved for her daughter's loss, came aboard the plane with other passengers who were unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"All the time I've done is cry low.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought you needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Tickets for two women in pain to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose suicides are committed to preventing others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and died at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said it lit up every room they came in."
But before he died, he left his job because the depression had brought him "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had taken his life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear that there will be a chain effect."
He created tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can contact to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
The Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, have lost Mark, his companion for 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"You never said he felt down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking at them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to work out: "He has lacerated the family.
He broke us.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: the FBI started the investigation
"I think that if we could proceed as you asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that she feared that the committee was "losing calm" because of the blockade of the radical supporters.
Why doesn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left at the mid-term elections on 6 November. If the Republicans as expected will get a negative result, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators in pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
We will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break in and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees from North Korea "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that the refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest tariffs demanded by those who illegally release these people.
Pyongyang did not issue public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ).
China considers them illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are in a deadlock situation.
This after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament for the first time," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and argues that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and states that it is not characteristically suitable for this position.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman behaved in the same way, they would call it hysterical," said Pelosi on Thursday's statement made by Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's judicial committee.
In a visibly excited way Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually molesting Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so much so that he could almost scream and with his throat narrow from crying as he talked about his family and his years at high school.
He has also explicitly condemned the democrats of the committee who have defined the accusations against him a "absurd and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi believes that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that it cannot enter the Supreme Court because it has proved to be prevented against the democrats.
"I think he has self-excluded himself with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
The Pelosi then objected when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in a state of charge in the event of confirmation and whether the Democrats should reach the House of Representatives.
"I think if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court you're presiding now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intentions to overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Pelosi said that "you cannot send a hysterical and party person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger attacks that he can't get out of without crying.
"We wail when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere. She told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique so when she was angry and started crying she told the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so he kept going.
I thought his idea was brilliant."
Tears are tolerated as the vent of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a male mostly office dates back to when I once started crying for an access of anger. An older woman than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified took me for the colt and dragged me along the stairs.
"Never let yourself be weeped," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they have you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential run.
In 1987, when the extra-marital relationship of Hart that had to give up the race was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she should not have tried to run for the presidency herself.
"In fact, it wasn't a well-considered decision," he said, laughing at us over 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and certainly no one else was needed.
Someone called them "Biancaneve and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fund-raising and swore that she would not apply if she had not raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause in departure.
He found out that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 men to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" she asked.
When she took the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters that representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination she was victims of), that she moved.
"It looked like you were preying on a nervous collapse," Schroeder recalled, thinking about the press reaction.
"Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write about my tombstone.
Maybe "A lot of piss."
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Help Beijing · Global Voices
The opening blows of the trade war between the USA and China have been bleak and, while the battle is far from over, the experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the new articles duties of more than $200 billion (EUR 175 billion) worth. This means that half of the Chinese goods will be taxed.
Beijing has reacted every time with similar measures applying recently duties from five to ten percent on 60 billion US dollars of goods.
China has promised to respond to the US blow-off and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economic power will soon move back.
Because Washington renounces us, it would be necessary to give in to his demands, but publicly folding to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, the experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the USA can positively influence China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security research centre.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to return refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by over seven years of war.
In the face of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any subordinate aid under conditions or by those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has regained its trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tee shot in the water at the 16th hole of par 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his shifts becoming one of the four players always to register a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the inferior Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won more in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team win and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an exciting Garcia after the European win.
Pass the witness to his fellow countryman John Ram who beat the US golf legend Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 in Sunday singles.
"If I think I grew up watching his meetings, I'm really proud that I beat Tiger Woods," said twenty-three-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his matches in the Ryder Cup amounts to 13 victories, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think you are one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to only Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been looking all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain USA Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put the Europe team under pressure.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all on.
But they played better than us."
