When we go to die, we will be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we will be about to leave. The earthly friends - the friends who point to our position, our wealth or our social qualities, - will leave us when we enter the dark valley. Of those bound to us by stronger bonds - our relatives, our loved ones, our children, brothers, sisters, and others who are no less loved by us who have been made our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior, - of them we must also go. Though not everything will leave us. There is One who "stays closer than a brother" - One who has loved the Suyos who are in the world, loves them to the end.
