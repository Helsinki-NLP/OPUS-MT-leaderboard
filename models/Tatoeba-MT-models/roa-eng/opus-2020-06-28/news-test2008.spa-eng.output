European inflation has slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the sharp growth in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, recording - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, together with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "need to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, struck the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Prices at the end of wheat increased by 88 per cent, and soy levies also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year by 52 percent, already reaching last month the black gold almost 100 dollars per barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, but by 2009 it will decrease to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the party's secure voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition's voters - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is about two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison to the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who found the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for next year, the majority of the population is deteriorating and only one-tenth of the population expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government was more poor than his duties.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 per cent of the population did not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent did not trust the President of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to hold the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that it would certainly participate and another 20 percent said that it is likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "general elections to be held this Sunday" it would certainly participate only 55 percent of the population and 15 percent of the population likely believe their participation. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, the payment for medical consultations and that of hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has five times its prices
They maintained the average price increase of 16 percent of the hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that this year no VAT has been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased in an average of 16 percent in the trade triangle of Budaörs gold the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was much higher growth than the thousand HUF.
As in December last year, prices in food supermarkets had already been "dispatched", so there was no drastic increase in percentages compared to the high point of departure.
However, it is obviously scary for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below 9,000 HUF, today they cannot do so even for ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 this basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-litre bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket was the most expensive, while Cora's cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased with a 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the most expensive basket values of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in the prices the increase in VAT was felt.
Just this process was the one that destroyed the trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in consumer prices.
(If the trader misplans the speed of movement of a product, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent the price of consumer goods of first need.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some first-need foods, recorded a price increase of over 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases only a 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can impose a drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the trade triangle of gold, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, carrying the preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because they suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that domestic sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because incomes are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many hospitals save themselves with disinfectants
This year, thousands of infections caused primarily by improper application of antibiotics have been recorded in hospitals.
The circumstances of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of the staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-head department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals it saves even the disinfectants.
Not long ago, an infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A seriously injured car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after returned to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacterium in his body.
Until December 10, this year, the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents have been recorded - said Karolina Böröcz, a doctor-head of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, and no information is available.
Nearly two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacilin.
One third of humans carry the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections produced by the SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are exaggerated or improperly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, become bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and rapidly contaminate in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis in the first place in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with the weakened organism, in the elderly, or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff cares for them in rubber and mask gloves and there are the antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable taking samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and homes of the elderly, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients who carry MRSA.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to public light when MRSA infections visible in the patient are already occurring - said the doctor-head department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union commits rigorously to the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medications, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples is even less frequent in patients travelling or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is contaminated with one patient to another through healthcare staff.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also considerable faults in hospitals in this regard.
MRSA is infected by the transmission of drops and direct contact between people, however in the national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately you can also experience - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favorable economic situation saves the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher likelihood for infection.
In the view of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate preventive measures are met, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the disease of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Sickness Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a tendency to decrease in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative on the alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district has been made.
One can exclude the possibility that led to drunk or in a staggered state that since then resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a transistor - said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcohol that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by doubling to Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district hit a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This latter fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give in to the step when doubling.)
The patient lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian finance minister János Veres and vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit limit agreements totalling EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit contract worth EUR 100 million, the contract they had just signed relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungary objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of €50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the project of innovations and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the subject of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes with the EU the details of the funding of the Metro, they will again deal with the issue of whether or not the original contract needs to be modified and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the credits is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a commission to keep the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate paradise
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country formerly mentioned.
What, where and who buy in the EU's cheaper market, will quickly grow?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and beach chalet.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for buildings also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - like Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of the real estate developers and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Sofia's capital, commercial and office spaces can also be attractive to promise a rapid recovery in investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their lives and ways of living.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and on ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, besides for them it is important the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium to long term.
The price of capital property is growing steadily, as demand is growing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of real estate significantly outweighs the growth in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarians
According to Environment and Hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Road Map available on post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the issue between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, the emission of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major issue of the conference is that if the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to provide material and technological assistance to the countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member steering board, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac es Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent to the 1990 level by 2020 regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit itself to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that were signatories to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 committed themselves to decline by 5.2 per cent, including the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to achieving 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period 1985-87, which our country will comply with, says the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a lot that is at stake in Bali, since in two years' time the international climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emissions reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the United Nations dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Thus, emission reduction would be delayed and an increase of more than 2o C in the average Earth temperature could not be prevented, which according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
British military units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube's services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general corps of operations of Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are now 139 recordings from Air Force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "headquarter defence" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment goals, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda practically costs nothing compared to conventional TV recruiting spots - the BBC said the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the reciprocatingly edited and censored recordings, amateur videos appear in the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of the losses, without yet presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can stand directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the minister of work Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a meeting of work for his colleagues who will be able to say goodbye in 2007 with salt pastry and coffee.
There is ministry that celebrates its feast with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you have fun power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defense, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
At the Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited the relatives of the soldiers who currently perform missions abroad. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will spend 25 million on the holiday environment of the end of the year.
The National Foment Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party regarding the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry is expected the presence of approximately 300 50.
At the party of the portfolio will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, will also perform artists and there will be raffle of tombola.
The NAF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday at the National Council for Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to hold a competition management company called Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without costume
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to [orig]’s question, they reported: To attend the dance, it was not compulsory to dress suit or evening dress.
The health, work and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monaco Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
It is attended by one hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department said - will only take coffee and salt pastry, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply give his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official nature will be given not only by ministerial discourse, but also by the time of the evening of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, Christmas will not be held in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and, according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the one hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will hold no Christmas party - this is what the relevant press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that more than four hundred people were invited for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The giant strike forces are coming together
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will constitute on Friday a strike commission to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday there will be a protest rally, while Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - work will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway transit will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Engineers' Union will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday there will be a protest rally, while on Monday the participating unions will strike for indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their appeal for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible to vote only on the public health law at very late night hours, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the urban bus transport of the companies Volán will have to be stopped.
At the same time, there will be a closing of half of the roads in many parts of the country.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement or even about the minimum services, although, as Christmas parties approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, Budapest airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike by the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educators' Unions called for a 2 a.m. strike and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators from 2 to 8 a.m.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will be on a national strike at alternative times and the Social and Health Workers' Democratic Union (SDTSSS) which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation which will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advanced pensions the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) that is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has, from several points of view, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity the highest political risk is that "with the worsening ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic confrontations may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocative event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main flaws of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This exacerbates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they believe.
Moreover, according to the research institute, the National Guard activity, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
We are reminded that: from the fall of 2006 it received increasing publicity and impetus for the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been formed in the country that are self-defining "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - add.
They affirmed: all this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
It is also a political strategy to highlight civil society and the form of partnership in the case of such associations.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to in many neighbouring States as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way that, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the extreme right-wing Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As has been written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The Research Director of Policy Capital, Attila Juhász, to the question of the news agency said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the coming year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, parties are not united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and festive days.
The holidays are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemeral events.
Let us celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that those who have spent celebrating the old year can rest.
All year round we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is national feast on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st, the festival of work, on November 1st and 2nd, we remind our deceased family and friends.
Also, in our country are two-day parties the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the holiday there is only one work day.
In exchange for extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the party.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions which, because of their role, work uninterruptedly even during public holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 it almost stops life in the country, since according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be modified around the work party so that, for four successive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26th, it will be a work day, so that on Friday, May 2nd it will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the party on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work instead of Friday 24th.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of the year party you can rest, since from 24 December you will not work anywhere, nor even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Little Dissuasives To Bitter Your Fellows' Life
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our daily Folklore at work.
It is important to decide whether to adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to warn you that you've been wanted by the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to fix the matter, you might call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you start to do a lot of hard work, it is worth meditating on the things that you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and consciously endeavor to avoid them.
Did you borrow something that wasn't yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to get a document, an office maid or your phone and you don't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but it disappeared this morning?
Can you find your lost pen at one of your colleagues' desk?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for taking away their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it of the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out before the time.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and who are you doing with?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Find out in yourself what you have heard and don't gossip about your colleague in his absence, but others also know about him.
You're leaving for sick leave unwarrantedly?
When you call the office on the phone and say you're sick and it unbearably hurts your head, you feel bad or you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others must do your job, your impossibly tasks, your job on purpose.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you're not going to the office or something can happen to you, so you have to stay home, communicate, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to confront you with your absence the next day.
Tarareos, risitas, phone calls
You're into your job, but you suddenly get the laughs of your colleagues out of him?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to her?
Do not bother your colleagues with your tararaos, songs, aloud conversations (less when you do them above his head), pataleos, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not currently deepening into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Do not blame others if you have not finished something in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Don't mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, nor the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize that you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: I live very comfortable for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be undressed, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires!
Lose interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car advances slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this mess when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yenderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and although rock style garage is again fashionable, break guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balaz Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yanderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to win, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematography (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public knew the set that initially was only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they are wearing this label or not pleasantly.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The recently released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balaz Zságer.
It is well the reference about the rust, about the flight, but in addition to the rusty of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi which recently broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station took to the ears of the radio players the high flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balaz Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Zságer Balaz: The public definition selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, senseless and can be composed equally just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can emerge from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the West of us, light music has bigger traditions.
Not only the fifteen-and-twenty-year-olds live there, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
We don't compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and did his career more like the West of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with Yonderboi's music, since many of us started our career in their group and from there we started another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people listened for the first time to Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Have you consciously opened up this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell our disc with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this soloist choir of good voice from our own national musical scene.
Thus was created this choir of six women - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Boris Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly that way the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the record, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night, I recorded the song that the girls learned later.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it looks as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief solo), they don't have their own role, they all sing together and not more strongly than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also shows about it, that we forget a while our ego, who has come from and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
He would have wanted to make others feel that state of euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma that I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything got to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "solved" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous purse runner risks billions for his inferiority complex
A vicious disloyal.
This is what Jerome Kerviel, the French banker of Société Generale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank, points out to his former employee.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He had long instigated, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"It has a fragile character" he let himself hear from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what comes out of Kerviel's answers according to what the French media, like the daily Le Monde, are that it was a man who had a profit of over 1,6 billion euros at the end of last year thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen it coming early this year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the sub-prime mortgage calls offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded the 1,6 billion euros.
"When I won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even cheated on the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange started to take an interest in his business.
The risk became beneficial
Did you have to find out?
More like, no.
"I thought I had won $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk yourself like that?
I had to work gradually in my position.
He joined the Société Generale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was in the range of $51,000.
Two years later he was already a broker in the stock exchange and in 2005 he became a broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I'd never win as much as anyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I noticed that I was being looked at with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombing attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a boot mechanism, and it wanted more.
If you win, we leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they were rather suspicious of it.
"As long as he made money, he closed his eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to delete all fingerprints.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working in the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they track him down?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," said Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
It is almost half the total that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will emerge for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which next year will have 90,800 million kronas.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Enterprises should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least-used newly registered countries.
Twenty-year penalty for the former president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal passed the 20-year sentence on the former President of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the upsurge of $100 billion (about 1.8 billion kroner).
However, a while later, he was released from prison for house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back among bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez will rather depend on prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Alemán constantly transferred government money to a company’s account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign in the elections of 2001.
That's how the budget approved us.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that it could not be allowed to not accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, approved the new law with tranquillity.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but in it lies the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore of special concern to the media.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year 2008 cannot be easily solved:
The first is the high participation of compulsory laws, called the cost of agents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved before last year before the elections for the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first default.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, taxes and credits from banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the mass sale of energy and other development networks that they have received from the state and from privatization.
At present they do not have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, as ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order to the state finances.
However, instead the state continued to overwhelm itself.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that, above all, the previous government falls.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why we do not need the mass social programmes that, unfortunately, in recent years have been inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform do not change soon then it will be the real end of any policy in this country and, govern who rules it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
So this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure from the normal spending of the agents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become officials only so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be received through tenders in the Monetary Marking.
In these bids the banks increase the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another $24 billion will make it easier for the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company wrote in his customer report.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $6 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what is still waiting for them when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they could not reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said Reuters Agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to start the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: The discussions of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated his view of the problem of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue book, not the green planet, he commented that the discussions of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now find out about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his view that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement on the warming of the planet among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels to be a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he is against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus talked about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and thus failed to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that the officials of the time up to the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid card.
According to traffic, the carnet hasn't changed mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of meats, the metropolitan offices are full of applications and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 daily customers.
The tails are expected for half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet been taken out of the new card.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their card and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will be liable to a fine from January onwards.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The police can fix the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, a fine could be issued to a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to receive moderate fines of up to 1,000 kronas.
According to the vowel of the ministry of transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should hand over the driver's license.
Just bring him or send him by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the carnées issued during 1964 and 1993 were no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually be changing the other types of driving licences.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card which was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty for the accomplice detectives in Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a final maturity the reduction of sentences, the first to a year, and the second to two years.
The department's detectives were to fight organized crime, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Against today's decision it is no longer possible to appeal, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case indicted, but he is first of all awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, in other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were invented cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in accordance with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the theft, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, his victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without arms permission.
In the home registry, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and an machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns.
Except for nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still reporting from other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pąt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity house the lawyer of the families affected, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital in Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is in principle not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"This demand is not approved, it is too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"So that we can get an idea of this counter proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisor value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all," said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was developed at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress from different levels and depth.
The stress situation was best borne by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women are taking it worse with the trauma they are experiencing today and with respect to what is happening today, Velebah completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič Maternity House last year, December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family in late October 100,000 crowns as compensation for the mistake made in the hospital of Třebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as damages responsibilities.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask the administrator for help.
The court so far recognized them as proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count on hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost his plea on the Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the Provincial Court of Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The plea is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polivka's popularity," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and therefore could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the brand Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of directing it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš found it necessary to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comical origin it turned out to be a lucrative business and business from which Harabiš later created the society Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed on the use of his name and signature on the passports and even offered his owners discounts to the visitors of his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who have devoted themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "king Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš derived in the singer Jarmila Šulaková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court so far.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament on the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: overcompensation
To tell the truth I've never liked Peugeot too much 206.
Its walking characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now its successor, Peugeot 207, is much better on the market.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi body means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so as not to repeat too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the design invention though already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi disappears the quoted shortage of space in the header.
Suitcases
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the lowered back door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But we'll stay at the depot.
According to the tables, the basic system has a capacity of 428 liters, which compared to competition is rather a mean value.
But not compared to the type of vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav's model, let's find that Peugeot stays behind with his perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's crib its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the flat that is quite flat after cutting the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car tester was equipped with a four valve injection ignition on a 1.6 l. capacity and a 88 kW force.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that despised the family member five doors.
It is quiet, consume little and above all, has impulse.
If I compare it with the era of the then škoda that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was covered by a rag, I can say that I can be impressed with it.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 kroner, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kroner, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches 80,000 other crowns.
Just that we would still have airbags on our heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated back windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 kroner.
It's a lot, but it has the equipment's complements in Fabia and it's going to get to a fairly similar number.
Now it is only left to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries are assisted and so the locals are afraid of further changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools register cases where conflicts between migrants and children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between the natives and the Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and clams among students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a 10-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her child with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy came to us at the bus stop and started spitting.
When I told him to let go of it, he made the urge to throw apples and pears at us, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his butt," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated conflict with Eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
In Britain 70,000 Slovaks have been registered here for labour reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
On one island alone there is still much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place that human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the 20s.
He ordered him to build one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything there was of crime in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, by wide avenues the cars ran which were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio they left their signatures the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all America.
And today?
On the walls of the free Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive National Hotel you mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those already 50-year-old cars, until today, continue to work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating markedly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by the lovers of the railroad.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow channels in steam or electrical machines.
His coachmen for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And so, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned estate there is a museum that for those who are writer's lovers, they should not stop visiting it.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on land of limestone rock.
Mogots, limestone rock piles and steep rock rocks in the valley falls, and its caves acclimatize fertile lands through which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the state-of-the-art factories can be found with their final product.
Perhaps someone would find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was rolled there.
Trinidad
An old town that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a distant place that in the 1950s there was no road that would unite it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the surrounding area such as the Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed on the way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pure, Sierra Maestra, Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santería, an African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages of it.
However, as they say, it's better to see it sometimes.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed are what is influencing the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not as expected, and the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to do more, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and sharing development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but the armed forces can only be one solution.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone," said the BBC station, Minister of Defence, Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew as compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of whom the fourth part is in the southern part of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They are exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We'll have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we'll achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, the NATO Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
"I'm not happy about what we have on earth and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the soldiers and teams we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency in closing the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Among the countries that have been attending in recent months there is controversy as to whether all the allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
It was passively criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," said Gates.
The sensationalist Sun, this week, called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech the State must have 84,000 kroner.
The total debt amounted in September to 842.7 billion kroner.
This year the government planned to lend 159,200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew by the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
However, since June, there has been a decrease of 13.400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt is 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the State was indebted with over 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the border of the trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900,000 million and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora sees it: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we do not yet know.
If the situation in the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see it," he added.
Doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and, above all, comes from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state's debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal indebtedness of the state grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million kroner.
External debt has now grown from 1,7 billion kroner to 123,300 million kroner.
The so-called state-negotiable debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.700 million kronas.
The average state debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt of the first to the third trimester creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is mainly generated from the obligations where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad for the debt to grow but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
The state's debt management and payment strategy for 2007 is based on the government's plans to lend 159.2 billion kroner this year.
In early December, the Ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the state budget developments.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit in the state budget which this year will be 76 million kroner instead of the anticipated 91,300 million kroner.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.300 million kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner for the financing of the state's obligations and 1.8 billion kroner for payments of the European Investment Bank's loans.
Compared today in court to Jartum for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam had been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, his lawyer said.
The Britannia was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years old to give the name of Mohammed to a teddy bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable to a penalty of whipping.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School in Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
" Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear himself did not bear any labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, specified that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry that he only asked the children to vote for a name " , it is according to him that it is only an " innocent mistake " .
Opinion divided by numerous schoolteacher students who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
For example, can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last negotiation session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
" It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, pointing out that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the occupied province to 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the UN last August.
US and Europeans believe that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the continuation of negotiations beyond that date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN Kosovo administration, the Westerners believe that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve it in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his sorrows.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan " belonged to a past that has led to murder and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has for his part considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about a " dominating effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s' independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
Journalists Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from Albanians would be " in consultation " with the West.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference which he had convened on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed immediately to enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old contention between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties' obligations with regard to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main problems of the controversial issue between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
Going back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the coming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of his " vision of two co-existing Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to that end by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects ", says Prince Saoud in his daily interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As well as every time in these kinds of events, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (PGI), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in surgery but in patrol, and I was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without rotating light," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to move on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
" He hit the police car on the left side, after a failure of the cedar the step to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the loose front, cracked windshields, bumps torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " facts of involuntary murder and denial of aid " to the IGPN, cocognised with the department of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor pointed out that the investigation of the IGPN at this stadium ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the police version, namely that this mini-vehicle arrived relatively quickly on its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the footpaths on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been locked in time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, thus not helping both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also remove " all serious misconduct " from this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which we have to be very careful," specified a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that he gives to the scene.
"Let us go down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, count this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely messed up cop, who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone. "
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently to the certainty that they had the people present of the unexpected situation of the young, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief arrived " about 20 minutes after the police march " .
They also performed heart massages in vain.
" I will not assume that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Voltage rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by the tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding police.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been asked.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gathered the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president " urged the population to send flowers to judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the wastes they swore oaths before Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise no longer meets "
The Pakistan Supreme Court is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " is no longer valued " after the state of emergency, he declared Monday to the assistant minister of information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the army.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unanticipated births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not foreseen, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unanticipated births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still present a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed a better "domination of fertility " according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20-44 years is increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapped" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery launcher, a thick cylindrical piece to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratory.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module which have a length of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in a little bit more or less than a meter by a wire that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who initially had to make a check-out of the Discovery launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters long of the remotely directed arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker in the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skillful, has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been charged with "operation" of the solar panel "wound".
After having inspected precisely the damage, he sectioned the fallable cable and installed types of "setters" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had remained near the air lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapped" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making inventory of its instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts returned from the Discovery launcher to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under sharp decline in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aircraft and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays due to slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which condition the initial flight of the aircraft.
The cost of offsetting the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus ", announced the parent house of the European EADS builder.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more accurateness.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational outcome of EADS failed 86% in 2006, mainly due to burdens related to delays in another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group expected a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: Russians are going to choose massively for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends the voters a televised message about the public networks, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new burden on the West accused of interference - his favourite issue during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Report a pressure-damaged campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is never " ever had such dirty elections, even in Eltsin's time ".
After the repression of the last weekend demonstrations, to the former World Champion of Jack Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians guarded the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that elected the government and the president?
Whatever the legislative elections, as well as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel the owners of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic failure ", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " willingly renounce the personal responsibility " of those whom they had briefly demonstrated after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What do you reflect for?"
The phenomenon touches on all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " What do I reflect for?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million files, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or of his right people.
The eleven states in charge of their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searching "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening of these documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or the mental hangicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way to compensation.
Still in Bad Arolsen today, more than 300 permanent wage earners deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Today, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath said.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers approved the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) with a view to signing free trade agreements.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will do so much for both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans ", Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential." The European Union and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England notes concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current shift in concerns about credit conditions, and announced a bid of £10 billion at the base rate of 5.75 per cent over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" To alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its projected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market thus on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the bank England BoE puts on the liquidity market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the " interbank loan indexes " per day in line with its base index.
The interbank rate per day was Wednesday, 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was established at 6,6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties refuse to examine the PS party's propositions on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre group refused Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text was part of a socialist "nic" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), and declined by a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS national office, including the 50% increase in employment surplus, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal rate for oil products), a transport check or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session was held at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition at some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with someone who inspired, no less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place from August 8th to 10th on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the " most inspiring event " he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to set up a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnated in low-grade policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones chases.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we were preparing to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that has recently taken place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being demarcated in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of country festival in the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer at this festival is "very great", for example that of 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been given to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, is Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator · Global Voices
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movies to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The career at the festivals
For the time being, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oskar race has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, value them and ensure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also featured four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to dismiss the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December in stock usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties are growing on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange being picked up in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not without volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline of the types of the Fed is not known, given the high level of the raw and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, sales manager for BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say there will be rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
Ibex has lost about 4% since its peaks on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year by almost 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be something different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be the ones responsible for taking Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches the great values."
The expert would include the two large banks and some builders in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electrical sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco ensures that the rise will come from the hands of the bank and industry.
The builders may also benefit from this rally, if given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bassist month.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the stinging of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a peak of 6.68 per cent.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being, Ibex has risen 8.36% since January) and whether it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew a large part of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent for the bank a great change.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to give the jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the Popular experience will be decisive for other entities to focus on this initiative, which reflects the timetables of trade.
Precisely this is the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and shopping streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise its branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the various streets.
Thus, the expansion of the timetables is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, claims that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a higher recruitment of staff, since it is now about six employees per site to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his initiative at three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been the chosen ones, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the value in Stock of its rival Antenna 3
We did it.
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain leading doubled the value of his rival, Antenna 3.
Only one aspect bothered his joy: 'it is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have fallen less,' he said.
Even so, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain places its loss in what we have carried on year by year at 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who yesterday gave in to 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Editor of Five Days) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the advertising of the group.
If this announced figure were real, the television channel would record this exercise an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net invoicing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net revenues from television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile claims that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to which it has reduced the expected growth in income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena's earnings forecast 3 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Ibersecurities: Recommends to buy both values based mainly on their high dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Madrid Case: sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antenna 3 (maintainer) for the 'multiple attractive' and business lifts.

JPMorgan: recommends infraponder in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities for the efficient functioning of the markets.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fosters cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial service firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all operations they carry out, in order to facilitate supervision by the CMVC.
In their passage through the Congressional Economics Commission, several changes were incorporated, among which it stresses that the entitled debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be performed by graduates in economics and business 30 years after the actual decree delimiting professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on an external basis, will not require authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer collection services to various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance in how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and minister of economics, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise in the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at relatively high levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the Congress halls that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50 per cent to £12 billion (16,800 million) since it came into crisis in mid-September and had to rely on an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, he was accumulating record deposits of more than £25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of the money offered by the Government and which will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would re-name the entity with its Virgin Money trademark, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get those remaining £18 billion to reach the 30 billion target.
The group of the tycoon Richard Branson, known for its remarkable advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin consortium offer, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested Mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murtian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) today at the first hour of the morning because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption this week.
In addition, one of the consistory's secretaries and the municipality's chief of police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May replaced Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'headman' of this plot.
Agents continue to register municipal units and the Town Council and no further arrests are made in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption discovered earlier this week, has been imputed.
As previously reported by the SER Chain, the attorney of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore out of the house of Morales, was arrested with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban planning agreement with a Galician construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in case the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the Secretary of PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes seems" that the left-wing politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who made public on 15 November his decision not to present himself at the next general elections and to leave his career in active policy to fight climate change at university level.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has continued to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who the Economic Vice President will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect rather than the insult or the scream" and make "it more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes it seems sadly that the only place in Madrid where we can't talk calmly and quietly is Congress, the president of the government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good deeds" and he has not wanted to see himself already taking up his post so as not to fall into what he has pointed out his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is an immeasurably persecution both of the skeptics of their predictions and of those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is leading the EU in violation of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires a clear explanation to the Spaniards of what measures they are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has never been or will there be such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costsome, uncomfortable and threatening to account for companies and individuals.
Even the centime of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerously dangerously to Zapatero that he has hurried to deny it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, this man so useful for the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but he adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we move on a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
Arrested mayor and chief of the local police of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murtian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today have reported sources of research.
The building was arrested at its home and has been transferred to the Consistory, whose units are now located alongside numerous agents, who have also attended the Town Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial Floor and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanization so that the Galician Nuaria company would build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have come to court today.
According to the sources, the former alderman of Totana and today an autonomous parliamentary member of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as has the current bride of the former alderman, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Inmonuar Floor, integrated agency in the Group mentioned, and through which the bribes would have taken place.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murtian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the beamed parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Catholico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconizes, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (in fact the head of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there was, curiously, criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a baccalaureate student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Adviser in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague gives information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet discharge offences:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime for six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal records in the store worth less than 400 euros, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the one imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous kidney is punishable from three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punishable from six months to two years.
(article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authorization of the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone's getting out of hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor extended me one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the workers' monthly pay depend on what their peers earn.
The study has been carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
Researchers observed that if both were able to receive the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if it required so much science this conclusion.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla goes with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic remain at liberty.
Its names are on that list of which takes its title the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not stressed in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the siege.
What's the insurance for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible injuries, is an important expense that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, age of the car, marital status, type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured one.
This undertaking is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for being held liable for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of meat, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use it is given, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices according to statistics, so that to the greater likelihood of an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinisterity due to their prudence.
Similarly, by handing out the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency and thus the probability of having some kind of perchance.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age are faced with various disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and old age.
Although the ideal to be well assured is a risk-free insurance, there are other more economical options.
Precautionary drivers can opt for a complete risk with frankness, so they get insurance coverage at full risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would assume that the customer pays a portion of the amount of the sinister.
"The portion of the amount of the amount the customer provides will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age try to be careful and avoid the claims as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can be allowed to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old band drivers have it easier to hire insurance, since the rate of sinnestrality is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Young people are not usually able to make use of the experience previously gained when you are in an accident, and even when driving", says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'feel of the novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates a insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation permits him, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of sinnestrality, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (may be this of 300 euros), or, when there is a high level of bonus, one to third increased from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of taking on a greater amount of franchise," Luis Noguera says.
For retirees, an insurance at all risk is recommended with franchise (which is EUR 150), or one to third parties is extended when a high level of bonus is achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible claims, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Liguilla of the 'Champions', since the Italians serve to be first and the Scottish to condemn their classification.
The Italians add up ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two matches of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete for the World Clubs in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a square by the end of the 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossing in octaves.
Gordon Strachan's whole could serve even a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at the same nine-point pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitteren the Scots at night, who are confident to get into the eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the past campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to whom only triumph is worth, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into octaves and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being final and without options to pursue the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, at around 20,000 spectators, their first tour since its dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their gig at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video in which the story of the group that raged at the end of the 1990s is told.
The re-encounter and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', published in Spain by EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out to the stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public who was crowding the GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
In the opening of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "didn't see our wardrobe at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "by the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quinteto two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"She was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "things have been arranged and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last acted together in 1998.
For starters, on TV CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special aircraft from Virgin Airlines.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of children was waiting for them.
Among the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of fuel exports to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each scramble between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute prior to last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, gas monopoly owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will pay more to Ukraine, as it is committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbor Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine might pay 40 percent more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other Soviet former Central Asian nations.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record records of employees outside Europe, a vigilante said.
The recommendation of the Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign staff it counts on.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey for video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and permission to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should have the Guide to the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff."
BMA Scottish President Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General warned that the number may be higher, in part because the boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being implemented widely.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners in the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I had a great interest in this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in the cinema awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award to the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
actress Judi Dench was named the best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were given at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film -in black and white - that has soundtracks of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded with two awards - to better director and best debutant director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a head of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The Fifties, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmed the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal skull".
Winston said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
The independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil plant in Eastern Province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect Abqaiq facilities, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in arresting Saudis travelling to Iraq to join as militants to Al-Qaeda in fighting the Allied forces and supporting the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heresy by the most extreme Saudi Sunies.
Al-Qaeda militants have in mind many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - answered by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the country's pro-Western government - had as objectives residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," said the Interior Minister's spokesman on state television.
Arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thought" -the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to militants.
Venus climate can give you an idea of Earth's future
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European orbital spaceship showed the planet more like a Earth twin than it had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Both planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet does not have water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Physics Department of Oxford University and one of the leaders of Venus Express mission, says: "It's becoming clear why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when it's two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decommissioned "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, declared to be enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's unworthy that presidential candidates answer a snow monkey's questions.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary and ordinary voters record video questions and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon of Wednesday 28 November were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey that asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in the face of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the issuers noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest word exchanges of the night were given between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been the lead in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at home.
They both responded aggressively when asked if any candidates could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The minor candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the subject.
None have the word to be nominated for a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with the fear of toxic toys in China and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble toward the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in Jonah's history and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr Huckabee is growing in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements during the Wednesday debate.
They both went from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have been sold influences, nor are they any exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor do they suck off extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour ruling party, over £650,000 (US$1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister eluded calling an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has changed from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put corporate groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative case.
A three retired generals started a riot in the Lores chamber, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
They are now David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably heading towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to rule.
People don't believe them as politicians, but usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is more: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is putting on the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot argue that he is new.
Although I'd like to disown Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ear.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The irons aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died or been swindled directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be so, but he does not make a decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raiser who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not yet involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took over the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he is diluted in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - largely led by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morality is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Committee on Public Living Standards, because he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard cooperative work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
The crisis of subprime mortgages is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country credit card market.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the crisis of subprime mortgages contaminates other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already being seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measure the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law on the bankruptcy of individuals (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of morosity) would be growing again, or the conditions for borrowers may have been worsening.
The industry also reports robust payment rates, which show how much of their debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and credit card markets certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expired.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditor capacity of borrowers.
They can even work to make up for issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card’s debt goes up in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions for mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid asset retaliatory.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Capital One's finance chief Gary Perlin.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If the prices of houses are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
Those dorsal fins have to be kept under surveillance.
British bankers found guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with Enron's former head of financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud by colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, charges against bankers were of having alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The prosecution against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his spiral of fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British people knew it would value at an upward level.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay 20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
The British threesome was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failing businesses look successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for a company's presidents."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millonario Fair, an orgy of four days of consumption held in a center of events in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany crafted yachts to the diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel by the oil boom, Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at apogee.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As Saudis in the 1970s and Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will take place this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times)
Russia has 53 billionaires that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thankk.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time next to the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costume, two agents of real estate, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, reeled off the design suit he used as a red carpet veteran disshing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum zucchini, ice cream from Mövenpick, tables for in-house pools, apartments in Dubai and Teddy Gund bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a mural-size reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in "bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10-15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the brands of limited editions, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, General Manager of King Koil Beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modified luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chains bracelet car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in Swarovski-coloured crystals, so he resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of prices of real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire already, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) filled with stacks of one million dollars fake tickets.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake money piles, asking their friends to take pictures with their cell phones while resting on lots of money, or packing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgeon "chapuza" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up through White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car came out of the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up," said Mr Livingston, restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott House.
The authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for the tox screen, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that has abated to the top ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," said Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, who left two 14- and 11-year-old children, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the county union prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said the house was close to 3 P.M.
On November 21 and found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
It was declared dead in the place.
It has been more than a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh couldn't say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs Castro's home, where a marchito rosal is located on the front of the house, and a Dalmata bark on the back.
A blue drum labeled "ethyl vanilla" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was on the door of the coach, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks aside.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch with this one or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The federal reserve is expected to cut fees to raise the stock exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm the credit conditions with cuts at interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice-president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, President of the Reserve, declared that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize the credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. subprime mortgages.
Only 20 such posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the extensive S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index went up 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, when it closed to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to Britain's top-ranking companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 per cent, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3 per cent.
Before, it was stressed that credit tension in the markets reappeared after a strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, strained the credit and loan rates to three months "Libor" among the British banks, it was the highest since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes with trial the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important than the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is beginning to fill in offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
Whoever does not get the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for capacity.
Not only in cricket, the choice is difficult, because trials are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it just for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if you want to have impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first round even if Stephen Harmison declares for "fit and bowls" like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class cookies in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the stadium of Asgiriya can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played each test and did well in the first, with 5 cookies and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, fighting to settle at the same time who became a major player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today's session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favor Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of us.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the trial in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of elan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He holds up for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he returned his vehicle in an exhibition for the UK car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to say with excitement, "Did you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it is including its slipping pass to have effects on their games that seem to satisfy it, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah doesn't stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it's him who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work -and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on a government official convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I've read in the papers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease for a moment.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped get Al-Qaeda out of his bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the head of a Sunni Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged the citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my peers."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many stated that they had returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death camps.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my house down after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunni have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring back sectarian tensions and the struggle begins.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French"- that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves from the smallest federal state for his 50th anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of the Saar, which in a study by the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, colleges by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university degree here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 per cent.
However, the number of students coming from Saar is higher than average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"The vocational education system is used in the Saar," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than every five young people make their baccalaureate at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety range of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by one third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Saar forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering science specialties.
"After PISA's first study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind school development declined from 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field it can achieve good results.
Although the Sarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez let us modify the schedule in the South American country by delaying the half hour clock.
Today Chávez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As the Venezuelan State's Official Gazette has reported, according to the new law, the time will pass at less than four GMT hours.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed on its day the obligation to the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakup of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas on the liberation of hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", it's the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was spoken by the King of Spain who felt annoyed by the continuous interruptions by the leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in the real wage threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in the actual salary threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
The experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation's calculations, German employees are expected to have a real salary account lower than the previous year in 2007.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the spread of food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the burden of unemployment insurance by 3.3% over the course of one year, is just and reasonable.
Of course, the office of labour does not have to go back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, the rate of inflation with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil-derived sector was announced to the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that has not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlwinds in the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers have been suspected that lightning might exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not like this: if there was a life there one day, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, oscillating in such a way that temperatures under zero can be reached.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin on Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the 1990s there were no special missions, just for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the researchers, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with the Earth we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds the wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets have been formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been agglomerated that remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus disbanded in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the Merkel rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end this fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, he stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of Una China politics.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorship caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances such as those in France will occur.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like the case of France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Vandals were barricaded and shot at the police: after serious unrest involving young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to look at TAMBIÉN that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"That we have to take seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Schaeuble.
This concerns not only the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It's still early to sit the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people were involved in serious riots in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 is above average.
There must be more vocational training.
Kolat points out: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat thinks, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"Young people must be given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses overflew the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police are going to take rigorous action until necessary.
On Monday night, on Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot started with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more needs to be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, one must say: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
As to the criticism made of her for having repeatedly devoted herself to foreign policy proceedings, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was stated very clearly to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
We could not feel a minimum interest, nor any feeling of the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: preventing climate change: he praised himself very much for the decisions taken at Heiligendamm, but he does not say anything about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the leader of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he's trying to express himself to get a boost to people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and concerns about low-paid workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It's impressive how many times you're wrong to talk when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of early Republican pre-candidates on YouTube and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the beginning, tensions between candidates have been noted.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York "a shelter for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with serious reproaches: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former Massachusetts governor saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to the attacks: as so far the Republicans group does not have a clear favourite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
Small videos of 30 seconds, filmed by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, also do not have much content.
"With this isolation we let Hitler get to power," John McCain's reproach on his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted immediately on withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to acknowledge as torture the "Waterboarding ", an interrogation method, by letting a person drown, simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that, in the meantime, the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded the fact that they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," explains Romney, and he apologized to the people and the television audience for having been an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule end in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
Wednesday he transferred his army chief's mandate to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after it was carried out with power with an incruent military coup, the former general governs for the first time the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since being declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many supporters of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are returning.
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-estreno was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written at the best time of the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each one of them has in front of themselves his cajita, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle is seated Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On the left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmony was making music again.
What has to be rebelled here is this: the precise questions have shown that the name of the band was resounding in the minds of the people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misconception Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Can 2003 band from Cologne for their work of life, the faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on the stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years ago and at that time I did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, I obtained it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berliner Schaubuehne basement.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a workman in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the Snow band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an association banner appeared of Ottenstein's song Harmony in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed her desire to propel Harmony and do tests from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Roth ended up in esoteric themes and assured his existence with albums like "Flamende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and has since been more successful than he had Harmony.
The live album recording in Griessmer, that's to thank Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company set itself the goal of cultivating this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Snow! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony took the position of a super-band, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to which the future belongs".
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments with wires are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvised again.
They do nothing but fix microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is just like it had to be.
Three people who go deep into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already always an English term of origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of gender was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts, "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
The stage reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give a quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the inner darkness of the country during the war in Bosnia, was discovered again the actor Richard Gere.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in the films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to perhaps see the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he's chasing" (Why today movie titles have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and industry of the cinema hadn't been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence kept so far most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of whom acts very quickly and that also leads him to love her.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in fact there was never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another script writer (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about U.S. reporters in the war who are going to detect a Serbian war criminal called "zoro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that cannot be done by the army and every time it results in a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to him who doesn't let him just be a cynic with heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters, who was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to get revenge in a just way.
It is so bad that they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and points out that Americans and French people are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements among themselves.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, that hard is to be bad."
In films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it's hard to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or mine fields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short period of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood calls for a good film about the holocaust with the example of the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War Works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script writers don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) in telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The great dictator" were at the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know that the Nazi regime was so bad.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to film a movie.
Perhaps it must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When they asked him about the parallelisms between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed, and in Yugoslavia war will always reign.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games as an answer.
The Mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that it is necessary to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday this resignation is "not good for the economic location".
In the last time, no other project in the great city fostered as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political, sporting impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust kept his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in the organization of the Summer Olympics would not be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides it by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust says at the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no opportunity."
Yet this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to leave the opportunity, if the plans are ruined at this time," said Wednesday Günter Plosse, the director of HSB.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement of the Senate chief who made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public sports Federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designed Hamburg's request for universities in 2015 not as a "replacement" of the Olympics in Hamburg.
Only last week, the Sports Federation of Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The faction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgersschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking the valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"During many years the senate delayed the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olimpia for the small Grassbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed the cause of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, think about Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Is that so?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of Warhol works.
Most of the ninety-four "Type-Box" in this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the question about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum Museum of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stocolmo" type, which are in circulation in the international art market, are also found.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that had soap cardboard "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works in the Modern Museum they were exhibited hundreds of Brillo-card boxes. These did not make them Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed production in Sweden of some Limestone-boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Museum Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now talk about that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Stocolmo" type authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservators of the Modern Museum, investigated six Museum-owned Brillo-Boxes and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and emeriled their silvers tight and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the silvers. Besides, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York does not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects."
Already in Julio The Authentication Commission has formally announced that it accepts these "severe accusations" about soap dust boxes.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila had surrendered and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The government soldiers had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been strangled in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the Thursday trial for attempting a coup d'état in 2003 which ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could suddenly deposit himself with some 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police who were supposed to monitor him had come to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Councillor, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are sick," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to pass our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reingers troops, said that shortly the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday for a big demonstration against the president.
For months your government has been reproving corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that drew all the attention to the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines, there have been at least seven attempts at state coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versailles.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an share is 14, 46 euros.
It's only 20.05 percent of social capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options to further increase the financial share in Versailles.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
Wednesday already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its participation to the network operator of Duesseldorf by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution retains the shares for a third party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day took part with almost 10 percent of the telecom company Drillisch.
Drillisch to the extent of capital expansion placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies began negotiations on the marketing cooperation of DSL-products.
"We strengthen our collaboration," the spokesman for United Internet explained.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of ten percent to Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e., they participate in 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the Freenet public limited company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the German market consolidation of Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet and Drillisch holding company had 6.01 percent of Freenet participation directly.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
