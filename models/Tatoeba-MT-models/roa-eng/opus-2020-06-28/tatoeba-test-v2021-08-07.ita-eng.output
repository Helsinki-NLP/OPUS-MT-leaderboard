White f3, black pedone at e6, white pedone at g4, black woman at h4 - crazy check! This is jokingly indicated in chess circles as "sickness".
White: Tower in a1, pedestrian in b6, king in c8. Black: pedestrians in a7 and b7, king in a8, afier in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, then the Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its afier in any other check on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes advance his pawn from b6 to b7 and gives crazy check. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
