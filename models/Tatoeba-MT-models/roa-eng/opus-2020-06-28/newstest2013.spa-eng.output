A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people dying from the fall of lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted new laws that made the registration process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 2011 in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to vote on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to submit an identity document with photographs.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana law.
That is why the republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters aged between 18 and 29 do not have an identity card with photography.
And there's still more.
In many states the students, the voters who vote most for the Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic voting.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service of assistance to voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the drop in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the electorate in the state.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
They represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, white people, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, account for only 46 per cent of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have ardently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Ministry of Public Prosecution intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the submission of an identity document with photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the 2012 results in the key states.
A report from the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required at the polling station to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative amendments to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this respect, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do the test or not do it?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent in themselves, doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
Do the test or not?
We've asked for advice from experts.
Studies in the United States found a large index of contagions among sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between the patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not harm long-term life, in which case an active surveillance of the disease should be preferred.
Today, many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, since cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we evaluated that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
One hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to CCS.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Malting products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for its smoke, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to CCS, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about each other's family concerns and backgrounds with his doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less evil" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of making mistakes seem to be few. We will see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too hard, because it will end in harm.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it could be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearer" bosons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" to make this boson appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide down the surface.
That's why we need an immense particle accelerator like CERN's (the great Hadron Collider is a 27km ring of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the door of a refrigerator by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like photon, by the way), do not.
However, what can all these investigations "provide"?, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to look at the differences between MS observations and predictions.
Many, on the other hand, fervently want them to be found, as the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" covering certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of such investigations on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none.
For them to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this capturer now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume as soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Devoer tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've already been like this seven," he reports, made a pass, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused you damage: a huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on your own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, accept a resignation that will help you eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and give him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that they cure my diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learned that a man is standing piss," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the center of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made her children discover.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I no longer have desires in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for one last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help his death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know that we're all going to die someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Moribund is offered mouthwash with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," reports Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days go by without being ever equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who are cancer-stricken," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivant center come from their homes and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is agreed to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering from severe pains without having done what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists struggle with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left a exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the sick people who request death thank their caregivers who have not met their demands once they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely almighty with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, unrelieved disease is likely to have this palliative sedation.
The sick people who are not relieved say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The realization of this report has been possible thanks to a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fund collectors of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day by day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It turns out curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted the big media," ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal outbreak in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the misappropriation of road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts," with some of its instincts to remain with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, while waiting to be able to "show the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of interveners, researchers and government analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the police of the "Marteau Squadron", who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "laundry cartel" moderate in terms of inflating contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has taken a series of counts of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
Reimbursements in exchange for public contracts are suspected.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Acurso and Lino Zambit, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For three years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambita distributed money to the left and right during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for the former vice-president liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, ex-genier of public works, explained this perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribery from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for lease contracts whose costs have inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately making the view of a parallel budget and filled his pockets with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that made the alarm sound.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he has since 2010 opposed the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she claims that she pulls "from a thread in order to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We're cleaning up the wounds, but we'd need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so dubious practices don't recur.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned above all about the role of '"elected politicians aware of the stratagem".
Estimating in 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironic: "I have been told that this is only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story spoils the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I move forward from day to day by day.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements urge me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going really fast in football.
But I don't warm up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine Preformation Center to my Saint-Etienne pass, I have always moved on to a quick pace.
It's going to benefit from Carlo Ancelotti's competition.
This summer's recruits are used to competing very high-level matches.
They know every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
It's backed up by deputies like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like it in League 1 and it is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I was just getting out of a series of injuries.
The trust you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our leader's seat.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the Champions League: we have classified ourselves for the eighth final with style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We're going to try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say about many very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our leagues in front of Porto so that we can receive the return of eighths of the final.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to its means for that project to be realized.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would make a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts to take that title of champions.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, because we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a hard time.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a rather better season.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the guns to carry it.
Do you think the media expects more from the PSG?
It is normal that they wait a lot for us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have accepted it completely.
After we won 4-0 at home in Troyes, they still find things to blame for is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has not managed to rank for eighths of the final, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impelled" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we have a Zlatandendendence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League 1.
And it has shown in all the teams that it's happened that it's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you experience Eurocopa 2012 with the team from France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating gambling time.
I saw things there and I got reinforced.
Today I can play good matches in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus".
We have learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and we must have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the bleus?
It's getting results.
They are well placed in the classification group for the World Cup.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
The tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain served to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The quote of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to about ten dollars (the quotes are listed on the page bitcoincharts.com).
It is not impressive when compared to world changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types like "credit", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes swap).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in all exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depository of accounting books, verifiers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file slices, i.e. a transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numeric footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "scramble" the set.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in deposit.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Insitt in Israel analyzed the book and showed that about 80% bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
"They changed $30,000," Jon Holmquist rejoices, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite a lot in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in businesses, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide you with an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicted.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future without waiting for anything from us.
We have punished, above all, the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which was observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul as of the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahedins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, working with government lands to resell them as solars for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them haven't fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
These young people should be given work that they would not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. TV and Turkish leaflets that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned to reconstitute the provincial militias, which will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations. However, the United States had wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular because of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing happens except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor was that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig the huge Buddha site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "gain the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These hard work, which has gained local labour, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well-controlled and to reach them directly.
A Forceful Constitution in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt has used a provisional text, several times modified, which undermines institutional stability and leads to judicial hurdles.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "treason his word" and "swimming the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a step towards speeding up the institutional and political crisis and accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time forcing the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of recovering a popular and democratic legitimation while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this remedy has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or I vote for my text or I hold full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in large majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not enforce their views.
Human rights representatives, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As was to be expected, the articles voted on were unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies in the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent clock was wrong.
The text, which was late yesterday, was still being voted on, contains 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all looks, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals are talking about hypocrisy and believe that it is only advertising.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers an advisory role on the Al-Azhar University, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not olemmas but academics, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We specifically refer to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to rule over all of this."
Beyond its religious nature, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that there are few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers vested in the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Neither will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by associations for the defence of human rights.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing had been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to go out last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
The supporters of the head of state marched on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the world's navel and a sea of brine
The promised earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence on the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial was conducted, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Omblicus of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then come true.
Perform a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret shelter against enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by your own means, only those who are engaged in climbing can.
The others can reach this historic summit at the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Up to there, bus services are offered from the hill foot.
The overall length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On one trip you won't be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and swimmers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free, and no donations are categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below the sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustains even those who can't swim.
The landscapes of the surroundings are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend treatment courses with salt water, brine and curative clays and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to sort out their broken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
The ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, is preserved on the Mediterranean coast.
For her was the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your symbol "meism", fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Cesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to bring it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sundown on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transportation disrupts your job.
But Sunday morning starts a new workweek.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, Falafel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
Streets in Israeli cities do not see street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their liking" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Roosters love the crowded places and do not reject the golosinas.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, which goes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bike will come out for 15 shekels the day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to travel the country and rested were U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amounting to over 51 per cent at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the tongue
While human rights MPs and defenders are discussing the consequences of the mandatory review law, there have already been perpetrators who trade with "false" certificates in the country.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force, according to which each immigrant worker must carry out a test to verify his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made compulsory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to carry out the examination of the language, if not the examination of Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are no exception.
This law shall not apply to persons who obtained their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Russian Pushkin Institute of Language, the University of the Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to come to the test in all cities, and right now more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, have often been able to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring about?
What changes will make the knowledge of the language compulsory for both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will help resolve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are the immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid traveler" into a creepy, narrow cave, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the head of the Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, Chief!
However, in the meantime many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to talk about dressing them, shoeing them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's difficult, if you don't know the language, you recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
Examinations will only be carried out for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have such status, there will be no review and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false enrollment can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred roubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry false documents, are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are asked for one hundred roubles for cigarettes or tea," the Tajik citizen, Umed Hushkadamov, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be a stain, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Law on Language, it was pointed out that not only can immigration registration documents be false.
Several "false" language certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: every immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document 7,000 rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not successfully pass the exam the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: Shooting during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the lawyer Muscovita Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Shooting seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for obtaining leave to carry weapons from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "unsenseful rigidity be abandoned".
The percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, reported to Russian BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 offences were committed during the six months of 2012 with the use of firearms registered in internal organs, compared to the total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil-use arms sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to head to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first one, "the vestige of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon" is the one stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here the stolen weapons of police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials are included.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the fault," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put up their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute arms under a string to the black market, including that of Moscow," the expert says.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Large numbers of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explains.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data of portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market have come there "because of officials whose work is arms-related," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent are "illegal archeology".
Depending on one of the arms shops, which requested that their last name be not mentioned, he said that the weapons found by illegal excavators had not been bought by anyone for a long time because they were too old.
More often, it says, vendors go to military stores when they need a departure.
Through some alferez, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"It brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two shippers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be fulfilled, they make evidence purchases to illegal arms traders," adds the dependent.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed that I go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would take me to a "skitta" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I just found out there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also to be found, let's say "by Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I won't let him down.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when an article on the subject was available.
Schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't anything.
"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer cat for hare: everything can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any document or personal encounters.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There the users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván".
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," he laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: generally, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," says NGO press secretary "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets states that if an order is made online, one is left with no weapon and is put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed captures those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
One and a half months should be expected.
It is sent from the military stores by middle-ranking bosses.
According to official Ministry statistics, as compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike in the U.S.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, there has been a wave of protests against low wages paid to Walmart corporations supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose its strength and surrender in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages earned by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions started last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday. On that day, the U.S. co-hosted the riser that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, Walmart Corporation workers, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed pickets of protest along with the unions and left-wing activists in the corporate stores, whose products are directed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in your stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and supply of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to 12$ per hour, this will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters were satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday until the midnight of the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview at the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had only been "another trick of public relations", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the goals were not precisely the great Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less than they do in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonalds and worked there, behind the exhibitors, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Protest participants, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e., double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing the activists of the trade union movement with wits and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main factors is excessive staff turnover.
Discords
Rough protests took place that same day in other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular the Jumaane Williams Municipal Council member, who said: "McDonald's says he is selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
Protesters received support from other leading New York Democrats, for example from city mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest manifestation of this kind in American fast food history.
But it involved only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark for mass movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the glasses were already in a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We dedicate ourselves to the interaction person-computer, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years forward and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gestures control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has carried the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computer science must be freed from ours, from the physical to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to the devil with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, you are waiting to resolve the question of privacy, as you do not always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but everyone in their own field.
For example, for device control in public places, we had a project in which we think about gestures, but not about loose movements, but rather shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it's very big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or can't do right now the machine?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you have about modern cameras?
Are they missing resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z axis.
Speed, the number of frames per second is also important.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but it would not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible diaphragm.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a Kinect flexible analog, play with the camera location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from the glasses to the smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics usually point out: there is no touch answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh inruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well might be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air."For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is found gives a similar feeling to that one feels if someone is blowing it on the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried cheating on your brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here lies another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endlessly. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not like the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements come beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even knowing Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, to whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they show up.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophic accountants from St. Petersburg, who created new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's avant-garde in the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and raises all the mood.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became the organist of St. Petersburg, since he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything other than a little grey gives rise to aggression and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was already over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not the lyrics.
It was important for me to meet at the cultural centre of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear".
Schnur and his friends sang lightweight songs under phonogram, dressed tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There our employees and assiduous customers went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so finished my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make an exhibition scheduled, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
The clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything gets emboldened and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change in clothing.
Now one is followed by clothing, orientated on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps, that person is not to be given a hand, but to spit on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be nice?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people gathered in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other symplons.
Now everyone has divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to like everybody.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they arrive for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, there the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marching.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector hung them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: cultural officer.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was otherwise, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they're closed, because there's a need for experts at a higher level to correctly assess these and pave the way for them.
Now the subjective personal taste is prospering.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's it to you, St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a Saint Petersburg grant.
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with an asteroid killer.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same planet of replacement?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says head researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differentiate themselves in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophils.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to check how the embryo develops in conditions of unpregnancy.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia.
By not finding support, the chicks turned randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
Chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chickens born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the "Bion" biosatellite, only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had descent.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviote flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Commonata Preparation Centre is a mandatory step in the preparation for the flight.
Under zero buoyancy conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child is its birthplace.
The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the first bath only two weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget anything," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary for women.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvis muscles are decrepited very quickly, and the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, trusting in the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn born in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will give rise to bringing the earth to a disabled person, to a totally inadequate person," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships address themselves to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is limp.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKU), says this in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack", thus describing the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not disturb entrepreneurs with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or to demand obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech team and the German team, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, it follows the legislation in force in each country and then praxis itself.
We have joined everything and, although control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more strict and more complete", however, concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring about? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us stop investing efforts in the realization of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting something right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit on the allocations means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper", that those who want to look for failures in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or otherwise organized?
As for the offices, like the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in its case is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level, and in this respect differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely specified in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't mean any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, would it?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act mean for your Office? Is there any indication of its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, there must be some delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, whereby we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or, rather, an embroil for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "harden up" and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional council operational programmes), and each law not respected in the field of public procurement meant violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal judgment, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently declared that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, even the prime minister of the government cannot prevent the performance of the Office which has an obligation to carry out such checks and to demand obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but he can't say we'll do anything.
In the Public Procurement Act, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is what it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer because he does not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, but most of them can be transported
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most of the routes are transitable, in some cases caution should be extremed.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, in the peaks of the Metal Mounts, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the regional road traffic control centre.
The R6 expressway and the first-class road in the region are now unrestricted.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and snow seasoned.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have been formed on the tracks, reports on its pages the Direction of roads and highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of forming ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše Mountains to Orlické Hory.
There is a layer of snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemian area, the sky will be between clear and partially cloudy today, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three low zero and one positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although the precaution must be exhausted and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will vary between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowstorm and the subsequent descent of temperatures, some pathways could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will be mischievous, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is the result of information from the regional road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway can be carried almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on the road between kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and free of ice.
In the Pilsen and Tachov border road area with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third-class tracks are wet, so in this case they are also warned of sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less traffic lanes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading for the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be partially discarded.
After the chemical treatment, still remained snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators took the snow out at night; about three centimeters of snow were accumulated on the Šumper road, according to the track administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads can be carried without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Šumper road, remains of snow remain.
The drivers in the port of Červenohorské will be found with half-dried snow towards jeseník", has confirmed today an operator of the road administration of Šumper to the ČTK.
On the ground and at night they came to Jessenická also their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the road to Olomouc the roads are unrestricted, on the road to Šternberská the drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí region nad Labem and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different stages at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept under zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. However, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the mint.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on road I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the track with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news we like to catch on to.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state benefit we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar issued by December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, December 20 at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours in front of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project all together with our designer Hanza Augusta.
In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it in the beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All the performers will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charities and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and amused to work with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world be allocated to?
The equipment for the education center without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkąv usotav.
The students of Jedličkąv usutav school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to do so.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkąv usotav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and interpreters act in each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustutosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other "successful action" planned in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so here we will probably prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it can seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, boxes with the instruments...
However, we have managed well so far. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, something that still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found yourself with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that there is a lot of road to travel in the east.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it remains uncommon for a person to travel alone around the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in an elevator wheelchair, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that strives to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take an example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going through.
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever you want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap Let's go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the moment comes when eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the band in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedličkąv ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophon, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lağa Angelovič says, we left a little of our hands (laughs).
However, popularity has not reached these last years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We conclude that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's aid, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the spectacle is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in his own way, that all the new things are received with caution and it takes a long time to accept each other.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something suits people with disabilities, then, it is not just a breakthrough for them, but for the whole of society.
Did it help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe to you?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be rigorous in many respects and require some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they find out they have to come two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already in early 1998?
Only one: There Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Anyone who has will and will will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The goal of the concert is to raise the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational center without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkąv usotav of Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry on the early sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission in subsequent years.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, where, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresin was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who the author of the proposal was, nor is the project known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for dresin start-up or braking.
Information about this drain is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
Based on the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation came to the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komite Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft military missile techniques and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemmy, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to Astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) has sought to become a member of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year, the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He served this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach the 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in summer 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket tests were initiated in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was going to be the object of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available to the scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available volume space was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B it was 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C it was 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first air tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonata after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This therefore means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in labour cost (wage) is economic strain.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and thus "causes a downturn" of the competitor's price in order to make it with most of the market and thereby increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, thus, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state is necessarily growing.
All of this gives rise to the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their desire to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is reflected above all in changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already up to a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was published in connection with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressed by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to malvive with a pessimal wage on the edge of society, in the hope that some day it will reach the private investor capital country.
Do you have to wonder where it's coming from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African countries continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media allege that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by entering control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and therefore throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favor, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like the one that describes Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompei: "The state had been disintegrating and the administrations dealt with the force".
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without hindrance and the people went to the polls with the beat-up vote beforehand ... "there were no people in a position to aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls" ... "It began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man" ... Although Appianos thought of Pompei, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on disregarded preferences for the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not in its essence capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really demolishing fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international level and within the EU, the Czech Republic's government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That noting comes from violence and noting ever could" (There is nothing of violence and nothing could do), Sting in his song Fragile and whose starboard prays "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (we don't forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, reactions have emerged as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right of self-defence and puts Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and strikes Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the Autonomous Territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small surface of Middle East land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, who or what group of people is the main driving force of events in modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
In every epoch we can find an Alejandro Magno or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether these characters were always the ones who led their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who guided their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that at this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to reach it in a single generation.
Among these wealthy astronomical families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): Rothschilds.
Not much is written near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being waged: before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began printing money during the Secession War and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second was to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third was to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (similar to the number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be sufficient and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenicalism is nothing more than a pre-project for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operate, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of the First World War, they destroyed the Zarista Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, German capitulation (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
In order to prepare the World War II ground, bankers and politicians created a conflicting situation in the wake of the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses. Later, it was enough for the Germans to serve the Führer solution, which was strong and simple enough to point out to the guilty, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was to represent and represent so well the function of the fifth column, which took the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler drew too much from the line to which international bankers had tied him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for accepting the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to the Second World War, with the proclamation of the State of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If the international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a front-line victim, now together with the Arab population or, generally, Middle Eastern Muslims.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel’s sympathizers and detractors are carefully divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice engenders injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their representatives, because, as in our country, international bankers present only their candidates in the elections.
Israel's current president B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where it passes 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now displayed the words that David Rockefeller uttered in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And compels everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, to add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Film: If it gets raw, call Hollywood.
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was going to be in exchange for the disastrous Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah away could not be allowed, since, if it did, it threatened the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Incarcerated diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
Iran's failure contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which has reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to help a covert story with an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew who examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan brought by the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
For the lie to seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production society had even a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that came out well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film the moods are combined. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood typical scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men brought to look at the situation at the negotiating table, in the office corridors, by phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adiós petite, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film where the action doesn't take place in Boston City, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "walks" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the disconcert and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the tax team at the bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it's pretty well managed. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here everything doesn't go so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis occurs at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track becomes a madness).
The weakness of Argo is the uncontrollability that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, let alone, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, to value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that's going to be hard.
As an evocation of a real history and as proof of how exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leading positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the absurdities appointed is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women were better at living insurance prices because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people up to the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the contested EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biofuels to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline darkens the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of using the expression "untar butter" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from businesses has been criticized.
A quality plantain must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or more commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, demands the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it seeks only to harmonize non-homogenized national standards to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of edibles.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription last year that in the inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of slaughterhouses by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To avoid hurting the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, appointed in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for preserved mushrooms, which threatened a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the grant application.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We asked the European Union for compensation," said the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stores and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended to draw up grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often criticised, EU regulatory efforts and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union, rather, according to several experts, deserve our recognition.
According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as are other countries in the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious in these fights.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's request, but they had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and went on to call it "tuzemák".
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the Mazapán of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, Karlovy Vary’s cookies, Pohořelice’s carp and Třeboň’s carp and even the Žatec hop variety.
As protected seas of the EU, you can be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the boats of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you happen to stand for President's election?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were right in our country, then I wouldn't be running.
But I can no longer bear to see how it's stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves get unpunished, tax increases and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon afterwards it has been set on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I explained later that if I was elected a senator, I would run for the presidency.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample anyone who wants to start a change.
To this are added the media, which despise you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I'm told I bribed journalists or I've been advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To that end, the law must be changed.
As chairman, it does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby for the guidance profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or from the left, they reject it on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without party traps and dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and apply it.
Is he considered to be a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left-wing or a little right-wing.
What matters to me is that we go ahead.
I don't care if someone's right-wing or left-wing, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or from the ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He jokes when you're told he's a populist.
But you're not proving it with what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals that I am already talking about in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, he is only told.
And it cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to get it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to report why they don't want to.
If there is a strong character who points to disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get as much support for my programme as possible.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years' time, I'll leave it and return to the private sector.
Sounds a bit like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I showed up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did so voted on the establishment's representatives.
In the senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check out the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have any money.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
Talk about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat rated at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting against evils and injustices.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor demonstrates that there is not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign's expenses essentially cover what I will receive for Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before you were leaving this activity?
This has nothing to do with a bigger salary.
As I have promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody gets in those fancy old-fashioned libraries, huh?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, bears the dubious honour of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented in euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: we had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings alongside cynical, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books in size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Citizens esteemed:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called `Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of buildings of homes and elderly people.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small city lacks history, which to date had nothing more than to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a central milk house, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in his history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climbing to the top.
The completely acrystaled interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the covered brick floor and the elegant headlights clearly support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you raise your eyes, you can see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put up the classic spatial configuration and take out the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage: in the middle there are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The view, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the most everyday civil architects and engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like a day, in a French farm, we are faced with the proper by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness has been used in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands as a basis for holding the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This thin fabric lasts two seasons and then it is discarded.
For the library this fabric was taken, for the first time in such quantities, until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new and sporty shoe and car mix.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy a tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment that maintains atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it's hard to believe this given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sun's sun's sun's sun shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences situated across the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical information technology worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, the traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, because of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has fallen deep.
The shelves are stuffed.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Though he's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in this discipline that is known as the "creation of an identity" in the specialized slang.
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.
Finally, a starting point to form your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather sharp diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the observer status of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I do not think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, as it were, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still chanting what their role will be, but they've already started the path to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to the country like France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienated from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give him that much importance because it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the US has clearly been in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not excited at all about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to take a European stand.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a hairy subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to assume a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for him to accept such leadership?
Germany has not yet gotten used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to struggle to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and views and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is diminishing, but the EU does not currently cover that vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them even more unpopular, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is concealed a officially registered name in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given reason.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the Taylor Wessing firm specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
A new case comes to my table every week.
Impersons simply add a couple of letters so they can register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is recorded Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way as was the case with the manufacturer of Puma sports goods.
Pattloch opens an archivist in which he keeps seats in the Beijing Brands office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of forgerys.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to benefit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest and most rapidly growing luxury goods market.
However, the cancellation of dubious legal registrations in trademark registration is complicated and also means a lot of money.
Processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long since the name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay the plagiarism because the process has damaged the latter's brand in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a blank and blue logo that reminded BMW to a great extent; the case was dealt with in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trade mark office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the occupational emergency situation returned to normal".
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it means that China is leading the list of new registrations around the world for 10 consecutive years, according to the brand office.
This also seems to be the case with the number of valid logos, which is 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been paid for rights.
Otherwise, this means that on average each registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as shown by the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
Although the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the brand Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the use of the municipalities.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been justified, but the opposing party continues to fight at present.
We have to be very careful.
The case has now come to the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending a resolution.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the matter favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "sum of six euros" in order to reach a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers facing us in the Far East threaten even Europe,
specifically if the impersonators are secured there the rights on non-protected brands.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long since abandoned this commercial area, but it was able to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights legislation, but what needs to be done is to "register in China as well all that may be likely to be protected", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, singing, helping
Heidelberg tests the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland cheers AIDS orphans
The history of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contalt, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly rise, tumbling, twisting and following each other.
And Fiesta Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Medical Psychology Institute of Heidelberg the Imbongi choir tests a new song.
The fifty singers, aged 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the master of the house, have also arrived.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population are already HIV-positive.
The Association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, a child can be laid off.
This contribution will cover the school's enrolment, the uniform and ensure a hot meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "story narrator" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows how to speak fluidly this Bantu language, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir has been testing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8.733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 parents no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitzeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half.
More than 40 per cent of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying over thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but of the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association that has been professionally involved in AIDS orphans in Esitjeni since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The snails and snails are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most often given to men who have sexual relations with other men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomona, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (Hungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are reported in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has continued to decline since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinal discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and by physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they are frequently changed as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, from the fees paid by the choir for their actions throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the people themselves, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman of herself and with leadership skills, manages the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as is called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and care for children to attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for over 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chickens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the people to have HIV testing.
This is not an obvious thing, since, despite the clear evidence of this disease throughout the country, it is not usually openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and overflowing lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporary travelers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; not only does recognition bring with it an excellent atmosphere and great joy, but it has also managed to tear a couple of tears to someone other than another angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Get to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says local people.
And after visiting the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also iced water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice layer has been formed in the area of the planet which is permanently in the shade.
It seems that this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably coming from comets or, most likely, asteroids that in their day clashed with Mercury.
Nobody relates the ice finding to the possibility of life on the planet, says Chief Investigator of the Messenger Probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the planet dwarf Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of stars "recein born".
This region of star formation, called in a less romantic way by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunken image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the enormous Trifida Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with a simple view in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity with an earthly continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This star in circles could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they originated is still one of the great incognites of astronomy.
These are probably remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolino Galaxy.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since some dark lines of dust divide the heart of this stellar formation area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years from the Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion are engulfed to the other to end up colliding irremediably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cefeo.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars of our Milky Way.
This area of stellar formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also constantly emerging; at 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there's still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and the images that offer us have become more and more profound.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10,4 meters.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven metres.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed lifting angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) it can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, together with them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of a mirror of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would look like.
However, the most important information in the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission 1,235 candidates had been located on planets.
The image shows the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope launch.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice in the south polo of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the North Pole.
For decades, radar measurements have focused on the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first orbiting around Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The route through the mountainous region of Talysh could be called wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great streak through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of the local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town not known much of which, apart from perfectly mastering the Persian and Azerbaijani and which are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centres, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshi of the place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to an image in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A child of yours died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate at all.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the old age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; even if there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum director, Ms Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich food of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which also drink a glass of melted butter daily, be so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At its 97th age, she is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, it moves tirelessly a huge bowl of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, both became grandparents long ago.
They also play two young children from one side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea serving in typical, stunned-shaped glasses.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blond hair that your child discovers to us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept her color.
"I never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never been shopping for a supermarket.
Then tell us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to its source when the "Dear Father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult which professes itself to the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he transferred the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) for monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's canyoso son is right: "In our culture the elders are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations competing with each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is submerged.
The future constitution, with the sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not hesitate in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, unremedied so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
You mean to deprive the judiciary of your power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly made up of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean, "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that it carries, to impose a more strict interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all questions relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression of the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft establishes, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Yet another forbids offending or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the formulation that prohibits "offends to people"
Is it enough for a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of Islamists for weeks now.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to fail the Act before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end by winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes third place on the lists in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the bucket of the trash of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy."
"When he summons the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow it," says oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned," Egyptians quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali in the media.
And a number of judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-protest; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it in the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded that Morsi "clean the country," while proclaiming, "the Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the ballot box which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft Islamists have guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he would share his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protestant in Tahrir Square warns: "you are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's worst fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has any connection with its greed for a highly malicious fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave him there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisites.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is a salad trout that lets you ferment in water during, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then drink an aquavit glass of a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city fireman who is also known as the "Rakfisk General", who organizes the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a large drink quantities.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I try some slices.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, the fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in mid-winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive social services system.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and so far not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be an important part of Norway's past, but rather a bad part.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it to be.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22."
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, there has been the growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and, with her long blonde melena and her surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is flawless.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While everyone was was was was wasting money that they did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carcased detour.
I'm in the snow doing tail to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, he comes back with that bad fish.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of the many places where rakfisk dinner is held, where the comensals vote for the best fish, or maybe the one that most test the nasal pits.
A TV has connected live with a presenter who carries a birdie and is surrounded by dishes of rakfisk.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, since Monday a steel fence has been installed that cuts off several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their jobs, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has achieved good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already been charged some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before co-opting with the US President, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, that of Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive along one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and filled roads that have been rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with their name in the entrance of a modern polydeportive and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, in terms of security and economics, we expect the interesting and true change our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the ruling that the opposition lacks the essence of the new President.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic stateman and, above all, he's a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza City, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was called for to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in only the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to deal with the problem of feminicide while in office.
The most critical are accusing their administration of making a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears as she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came to his house, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross in which one reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a whistleblower, a scoffer.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and to shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years and the new President has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope he's the same type of president as he was when he was a governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of the Neza City fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors try to deal with reports of abuse of Bradley Manning during their prison stay
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leaking of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits by unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request to dismiss the case, given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already resulted in sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the Friday view, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was incarcerated under maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the colostors as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, although officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the visiting officers had spoken to him about those problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was in.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below the possible suicide surveillance, to ensure his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the senior state to know that I was well and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness because of heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world only fell to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a pair of panties, some clothes and their glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from the outside pointing to his eyes as he slept.
He said that if the lodgers couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer submitted in January 2011 a formal complaint about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced for a morning count to stand naked in front of the lodgers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given to him by the janitor that he should drop the blanket with which he could have been covered, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his scarves to self-injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, his scarves, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers are hoping that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he has experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted on the war council, which is expected to begin in the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it intended to have Manning plead guilty to minor offences and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of application for any detainee under maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of information on the Internet, filtering information from the national defense and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down from the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters pointed the way to two tails: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
Having grown up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
These are ethnic shorthands, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends call themselves "Italian."
Later I decided to "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at that time this week that Mexico’s elected President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries gather, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also desiring to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico as if he ventured to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style commercial bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to yield half of its territory to the point of a gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So at the moment when a U.S. official says anything that leads to the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma stand at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was locked at the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more strongly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
They see us as Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to further complicate things, so I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexico's "ambassadors" improvised, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, folks.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how they treated their family a lot less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the futile and usual discussions about who first began, heaps of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything to taste or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal deadlock situation could be derailed.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been the nearest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf, has also done so.
Hamas' exultant members say that the half Islamic moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbullah militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an ever-increasing Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern side of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, Muslim Brothers are Hamas’ first brothers and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as the protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
The Israeli Iron Cup missile system has proven to be effective and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the barrier that runs the West Bank, the main piece of aspiring territory to become a State of Palestine, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party had joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, was in a good position.
Why pamper these Palestinian twists by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not shoot rockets like their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the area's superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire off is a good wish and could mark the start of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography makes the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution continues to be that of wise persons from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire gives a little more impetus to the people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to halt the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote your attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on boxes of an off-white color, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneers in the world, comes into force and replaces logos and brand colors with an olive green outage wrapper, frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different medical images and warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small type of source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government in Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls relate the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will bring serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited after the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, stated that the demand for silicone paints and coatings to cover up the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law at the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and that she was waiting for more stocks.
"For us it's a good deal."
According to the experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has come online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands from "footwear citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether it is only a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on what is involved in new regulations than in marketing.
Industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse new rules; these countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had had talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in the boxes.
They are now compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More harsh laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia, many smokers show themselves to be challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Unfortunately, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: by my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
"It would normally take an hour to devaluate a delivery; now it will take four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it is, okay, it ended and we closed the store," he says as he raises his hands upwards.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored.
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we flew on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development who praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both us and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in a good spirit?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Boring, An Animated History") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom dating from the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you."
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly".
Boring can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider that the problem is theirs.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which the participants heard a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the room adjacent to a television program at all volumes that kept no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that heard the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, and one of the study authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored."
"In fact, we now know that to move or to make a tie, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, since they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
In order to help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "trend to boredom scale".
The scale includes issues like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and his parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while he was in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boring percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest altitude," largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my principled question: Is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, carried to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as demonstrated by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain tells you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and gives him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable beyond the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to be bored more, but boredness is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something that is worth it," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No instruction book for the new law on marijuana use
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student at a community and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a judicial summons for possession of drugs and related articles (smaller crimes that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the voting in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of cases of minor drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana offences are being overturned both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the more conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have undertaken to proceed with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the subject around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licences, all of which before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states regarding the regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the State of Washington's Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model," he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to balance the state's requirement to provide "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition to do cannabis business on a radio of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"It will never be more difficult to locate an authorised cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing court proceedings for minor marijuana offences to persons over the age of 21, and that the police would stop bringing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the law of the city regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug vendors.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a more strict view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people face 56 grams or less marijuana charges, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office is under an obligation to bring legal action against those offences that occurred at the time of their occurrence were a crime," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer summons adults for small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think you're wasting your time on enforcing the law until it changes," she said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictive reactions throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with the district's prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused for marijuana possession and who is the local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marihuana Law.
"They've spent so much time leading people to the courts that, in fact, they can't accept it to be legal," he said.
As the first states that consider small amounts of marijuana the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national test cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new border of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisages the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
The advocates of the legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to knock doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to run for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an exaggeration of anti-drug policy by the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a City Council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in front of voting in favour of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got out of Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack college students by their point of view just now.
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a plaza at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, the two weeks of my position at Worcester College in the late 1980s to take the history career, I had already packed my bags, triggering the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were bewildered.
The newspaper The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that he was joking that I had gone because I was forced to drink in untapped cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that she came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that's for now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students are undergoing similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students is so in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College (JCR) claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as unthankful people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a seat on the equal opportunities committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on students' policy and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a silver stick.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" because of the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice president of the Conservative Party Association at Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wings in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, states that this environment is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill and elected president of the UCA, says that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are from the center of the right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I joined the university in September 1986, she was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hate to the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after the cuts in funding higher education.
The environment would have caused any Stalinist to tremble in terror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that the professors not only had a fat look at the mockery of conservative university students, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the miners' strike, the privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wood rooms of the seminar.
The first to attend was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
He doesn't say a thing.
Pitt, a man with a face that looked like a buffalo mass, knew well how to drive out bad biles.
"Is that the thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply silly?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a sorry soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight slap in the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented as a member of the UCAO.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it's going.
They're messing with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many Tories just arrived to appear to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to conceal.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They kick each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me just after dusk?
Should I become a Labourman and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expecting were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's adviser in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place for which he considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding shelter in my family and friends of openest metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they just did it to joke.
My heart would break if you left it."
Out of so many travels to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminary in which another history professor had insinuated, totally seriously speaking, that I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "old fools."
The truce lasted little time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college degree in Oxford.
That's when my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was inside scared and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left I packed my bag and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me a weak weep.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 ministers of the Conservative party but is, today, hiding behind a reputation that is not deserved for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
In occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 high seaswear dresses created by his "house" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the energized and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos are abundant with the signature of the most garnet of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: from humble modesty of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off the necks of their breasts on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful pop music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to their cottage in Gstaad," explains the exmujer of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on its floor.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Semen in 1995.
"It never goes by because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Slope Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamourous 60-metre long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade through the gateway to contemplate a dream "audience" that shows masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the garment that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the modist, in 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of the Fair.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and they are "gifts" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashion princess and pre-writer Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to use one of her evening costumes...
Finally, the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirts, draped "corsage" and escorts word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dress-making dress of the dressmaker with "maximum care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "king" of fashion
The big ending of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding suit at her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as called the dresser to their seamstresses) to elaborate this ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high seas of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Oboverned for years with the elite's "knowledge-being", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always drawn attention to its refinement, its calm, its clean and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the Countess Jacqueline's table in Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was flawless, time was not passing for him."
Says a princess...
The world's toughest trade: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people whose work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidified by contacting the air.
After tearing up large sulfur rocks, which in total come to weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them into two baskets of bamboo that carries on its shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb to the tortoise step, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall by the precipice.
They know that any transplant could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off for the Kawah Ijen risks years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euros for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once above, there is a passage between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, carrying tiredly the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little further down, to 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating since 1960 the volcano and, never better said, its workers, to whom 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euros) pay for each kilo of sulphur.
Then it is sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euros) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make waxes, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily ports.
It takes three hours in each and ends up grinding, but allows you to join 138,000 rupees (€11.5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is three times what I would gain in the field.
"The newspaper of the miners is very high here, where the collection of the coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (€1.2) the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (€ 167), "clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the cut was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people close to the volcano, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as the sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to become Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At his 27th birthday, Anto has been playing leather in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
She has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this smart young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop springing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, I go down to the crater lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at all weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of charge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," Madrusin protested, a wealthy 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Able to raise up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and picks the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of severe illness... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pains on the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been misformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only charge 50 kilos to his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions take out 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks move to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one who makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem shocking that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video turned viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a boo (bollo) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the ad you can draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people "his national duty."
This is a purely internet thing, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating evenings (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to make up a rap?
1.2 children
What doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of living goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "slipper box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units wear out days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give more clear guidance to developers, who were previously stuck to them if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre would seem to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, the Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the field of private life that has the right to protect from any interference".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your everyday life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venturing situations on the Internet that you would probably not share offline?
thejournal interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "very personal" and "key and user name" when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't go up to a post," Jorge says, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," he says.
In FB I upload beautiful pictures or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that isn't mine, or someone that's making a fool out of me," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked persons, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he meets the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to answer that I would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone recommending a stranger.
The case of Joseph, aged 14, is different.
The teenager holds open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to their friends list.
"I'm not scared, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it, I would just get them out of my account," she admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alienated from the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine's acquaintance was being extorted into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the bill.
"Just put him in privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I got hurt or felt like it.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to look for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we're still learning," he says.
He says that the theme is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what it is appropriate to disseminate, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do so is not useful," he adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like the one you published from a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When you tag photos of parties, did you ask the other people to tag them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they have to act online as they do off-line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary teacher and an educational consultant, said that it was essential for parents to read social media policies to their conscience.
By understanding each of the sections they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Concludes Unasur Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) today concluded in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Affairs and Presidential Affairs pointed out at an early stage that would deliver it after the closure, but later stated that it would be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among reporters was delivered by press spokespersons from some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document published during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the pronouncement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American Summit in the Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently required by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that will direct a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will comply and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean partner.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake along with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the IJC occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Covenant of Bogotá for which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the insatisbilities of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read out the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will "make important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements."
He reported that efforts are being made to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters in a joint and efficient manner".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas...joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian President said in a message he read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to maintain itself as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully following a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We're going to review all these paths, they're not exclusive, even the deal with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Bloc Defense Ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
In that regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship that encourages the Unasur member countries.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country, as is the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of recomposing the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
Those who give chair never commit themselves to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," said Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that it be subjected in his territory to interrogation for an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by videoconferencing, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian chief.
What there is is a danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by granting a safe conduit to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he said, "If Britain does tomorrow the safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr.Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took advantage to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and felt that what he did not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith, and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer "no longer the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he said that to be re-elected "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and beatism lined with legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
That failure is not yet realized.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed comprehensively to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute held in the same court in Peru and Chile and stated that "it is right for Latin America to seek international courts if the two countries undertake to accept judgment as hard as it is."
Referring to the eventuality that he is running for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as that of Ecuador, such socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that reponsibility," he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and from there we came out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and he told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, of routine, that he expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chavez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed the test result: positive AIDS.
"It was as if I fell into a bomb," he refers to recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more smooth," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of her illness alone and began to report on her; with such an effort that she already celebrated her 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civilian Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was evaluated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent of the immunological system that patients present when starting the diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years of age with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years of age, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "while in control they can live without problems up to 75 years of age," the interviewee explained.
To size this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since AIDS occurred, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, with 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had enough medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
It says a strong data: "New in every ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore have to provide evidence of massive detection to all people who require it."
His proposal coincides with experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to test himself to a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had made him a friend and, despite his short age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better turn around three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed well, exercise, take the drugs.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I co-responsible, I look after myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, that sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle motto for AIDS this 2012.
Condoms after the counter
Large are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapetized journalist who has taken the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "there has actually been an increase in the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packets of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorceress and value judgments of social workers, school mentors, pharmacies employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, said the communicator.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not be only after the showers and that 100 of them should be found in public bathroom dispatchers from the sites that young people attend.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Neither is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be a condom division in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he pointed.
Claves En Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual tract, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because for one registered case there are 4-5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a United States Court of Appeal a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a harmful precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the survival procedures of the signatures allowing Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, at the expense of international conventions.
In practical terms, the backlog of the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankrupt Court for the Northern Texas District leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
Inwardly, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial contest filed in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompanies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial contest the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their matrix, the majority required to approve the restructuring had not been achieved.
However, the possibility was recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The fact is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, it blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 onwards in the wake of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, by collecting it in the country.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal itself for the vote to be taken in full, i.e. the five judges, since they voted only three.
Failure to prosper will require the application of Cerciorare which requires a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the court suspended a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae ("the friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that the latter was disowned with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and beat the country.
General balance
For several months, the complaints put at the table by Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's ex-due, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Union of Air Pilots already found the bottleneck.
The instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal suit against the National Banking and Securities Commission accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General on an operation carried out by the employer to extract from Bank IXE's F/589 trust, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the chain of hotels Posadas.
They're looking for the Dragon Mars.
Meeting the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal center of sale and distribution in the face of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with an area of housing to the lime for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental body that razed with part of protected areas and posed the mother of all the magicians against the industry.
ACTA Died
The government called for a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known for its acronyms in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the Homex housing developer is placing 500 million pesos in the stock market.
The broadcast is the first of four identical offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, information technology leaders, has just been born a consortium with a competitive social reason, whose goal will be the service market of Central and South America software clusters.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 trillion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamdos of the basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a minor category player, a player of the National Higher Basketball, avowed and head of the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 90s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resided with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote his extensive trajectory, so testify.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who treasure the most emotion are those who remember their passage through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when they served 15 years as co-author or takeover of the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys' championships since 1967, already being taken over, co-authored or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships that ran from 1971 to 1975.
And then I took off with one in 1981, Jerome Mancy's debut year in the BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player of 6"7" height.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mancy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you saying that if Mancy had given Bayamon a championship, Gaussa would help bring another one.
The Cowmen's Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but it was already at the distance, since by 1988 it was already a federative mandames.
For that time I preferred to enjoy their executives and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Prelimic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup where we came fourth and it must have been bronze not by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that World Cup group in 1990 the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we kicked the team in the United States, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
Not only did that team repeat Mancy, Gaussus, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but it also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that may not be the best in terms of staff, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy was that of the 1995 Prelimic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the panamericano de Mar del Plata, we win gold against all the forecasts.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best boss in the country?
That's very hard.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90 the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things that he would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and face teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now the children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
I'm happy about that.
What are you doing now?
Most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman Dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a business man without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil tycoon predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producing "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss it a lot.
"He was an original person and he lived his life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant liver tumor was found and transplanted.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
She played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was altered when she found an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and led her to live with him at home.
She was also the protagonist of two comedy shows that were short of time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well-received papers for criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The drama series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling houses.
He also helped give the series a record of audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million TV viewers tuned it and turned it into "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with harlot's stain unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R's tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation you lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "great, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
There was immediately no pronouncement by Warner or TNT on how Hagman's loss will handle the series.
From Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who stellated classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage with counsel Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in the New York theaters in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would hurt someone or affect them in any way," she said to Press Associate at the time.
After liver transplantation, she became a sponsor for organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearsome patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, as "do not fear, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they will be fine."
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They begin course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the following couple of months: The hurricane cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debate" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," said Charmé this week to the students of Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could blow up.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a course, only entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always rely on the option of taking the course again, in case the world isn't over," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high-average course for students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still any place.
Students, for their part, make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only a matter of consolation or of its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in some way discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, aged 21 and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in these speculations.
"On other sides people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception from a higher authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think right away on the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several people said they think they're going to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
