Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president of history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will receive them, inter alia, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will reach the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and they will have a lot to do.
First, he visited the Nobel Institute, where he first met with the five members of the committee who, in October, chose him from 172 people to 33 organizations.
Then, the presidential couple scheduled a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third president to receive it in his position.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not wish to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraphins, but it has not yet decided to which particular organization.
During his full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochrancě přírody Litoměřice (Sociedad de defenders de la nature Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals required investors money for their own benefit, said Litoměřice Alena Romová police spokesman.
The president of the Nature Defense Society Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and facing a sentence of up to three years ' imprisonment.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate packaging from beverages and containers can be found in villages in southern Moravia to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There they need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, town councils are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle at the center to the right container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské noměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that in other parts it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By Vacancy
What happens is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw out several bottles of glass and plastic.
But at Kaicova Street, I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
Paroubek's budget removed money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the opinion of the government, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm everyone who rules in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and the communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government would later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness subsidies. "This means simply deferring problems for the future, it is putting mines," Janota says.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher interest and one day you have to pay back the money.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If it does not reduce the social benefits or operating costs of the State, it has to increase taxes.
To all those who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later on, so did your children.
People do not have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they will receive them. Of these accounts, 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the next year will not be lacking in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the effort of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Because of the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, the coming year will also lack five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors where the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also free of charge.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Karel Hanzelka Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonian solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transportation fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe or a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year, dividends are paid for ecological damage, serve to complete the income account, or serve as a reserve for the early retirement of income.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to provide various compensation to the victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international litigation, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Then the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, at worst, hand over the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million left for the Státní pokladna project (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and which has already been started. It should allow for online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to operate with two operating systems
The Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualizer software.
On your mobile you can wear two user profiles at a time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at once, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns the hoteliers
Not only do teleski maintainers in Krkonoše care about snow-free tracks.
The lack of snow makes people do not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
For this reason, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmas will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerąv Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save the money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers at Špindlerův Mlýn offer mainly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura said.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the squares offered are still open.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas rooms," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They are sold very well also on the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the snowless mountain.
If the clues remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also run out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and New Year's Eve, we have the last places free.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February it is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's rooms are already occupied also in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we found about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as it falls snow, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the Krkonoše hoteliers will feel like snow waiting.
Thursday must drop the temperatures and, if there are precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly expected, it was demonstrated that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the same text used several times as in Iraq, but it has not hesitated to use the title of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward."
He was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
In the following months, however, they showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of camp captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finalize this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions than he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing their boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. Following it will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capacity of action", a minimal objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocking for his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "go home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America initiates the triumphal withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution, however, will mean a dramatic setback to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential elections and that is why there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank executives will not receive cash bonuses again
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link the bonuses to Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to go, mentioned the former investor bank of the entity JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after leaving almost $17 billion (about CZK 300,000) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at once, with a 50% tax, the bank bonuses that exceed £25,000 (approximately £712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to him by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and the American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee picked up the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish krona (approximately 25 million Czech krona).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize is shared with each other.
The traditionally expected Nobel Peace Prize, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is raising his permanence in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subjects of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was attended by the spokesman for President Radim Ochvat.
On his permanence in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the Left's proposals for the transfer of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, there was a serious internal political conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may, but he does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is terrible and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS vice president Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200,000 million kroner.
Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by the American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91-year-old, asked him to play it in Eastwood's movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "When I interpret him, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama of boxing the world of the Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictitious president of the U.S., and even of God at Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to join his people through sport, and so he decides to join rugby players, who belong in the world measure to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
He had no other goal to play this role in such a way that it was as similar as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I shake your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh rugby world.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his house.
I remember knocking at the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the film I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of the Eastwood director, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also spoken of ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
The secret of splendor about Norway solved: Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence finally recognized yesterday that close to the borders with Norway, it tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, like "Bulava", formerly destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulavá" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this trial, the 13th trial, there was at first no problem.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
The engine probably crashed into the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians did not waver from the very beginning that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that you cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely wrong, only six of the thirteen were failed according to the Ministry of Defence management.
The success of almost 50 percent full of optimism to the generals, and so they continue to say that "Bulava" one day will fly smoothly and that it will even carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age.
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-present himself at the age of 51 at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play Friday in KHL duet against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and is currently chairing CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, quoted the AP agency Sergei Nenchinov, the Moscow club coach.
It is not yet clear whether the player's return will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the mood of other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the whole season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The largest group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed at the Canada Cup and at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also succeeded in the NHL: playing with Detroit won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the union requirements. Will cancel all supplementary work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the supplementary work.
Precisely because of frequent supplementary work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to wake up with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan as it is essential, so we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, i.e. two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturdays.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way its employees were motivated by the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a day off on December 28th, that is, prolong on one day Christmas parties, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
The car factory employees were forced to work two hours in addition to eight-hour shifts, and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and the trade unionists must be held on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they committed to meet the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously entered the strike due to frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against poor conditions of payment and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of the Monday strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, which last Wednesday stopped manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions demand that the company minimize it.
In addition, this year they require for this work a remuneration of 5,000 kroner.
The automobile factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was started last November.
Until September last year it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in ‘embedded’ HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some medicines already accessible.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly extended through a mix of medicines that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; drugs no longer work against them.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on the albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the medicines used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV Protease is an HIV virus albumin, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV fractionation does not occur and mature and infectious body cells of the virus will not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was carried out in a probe, as well as against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on medicinal products that are clinically used, but do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Žezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS Chief Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "scathing" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about his future existence.
The statements of ODS were marked by the Prime Minister as strong judgements.
They say it leaves time for the analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the left-wing parliamentary.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however with the amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for the salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the ODS proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feeling of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, that he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is his disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, who imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, whether the Chamber adopts other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that relate to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, underlined Topolánek in the US news text.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to rely on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about it, when the time is right, I will deal with it, told the journalists in the chamber of deputies the minister of defense Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
In the afternoon Prime Minister Fischer attended a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS surrendered at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, he reacted to Topolánek himself.
According to the new ČD train schedule will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train timetable enters into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not recirculate Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate fewer fast trains, will restrict direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction of the transport planned by Drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, the transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice and a few fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will only be reduced to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Miloice to Prague, the inhabitants of Miloice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15. line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to Miloice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at the station Prague Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for this year's regional railways: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive the year that comes four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the coming year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year old.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only occur in one-day tickets - ČD Net and in the cheap eLiška Internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces continue to hold more than 50 people, the children were released
Armed persons have kidnapped 75 people in the South of the Philippines today, including several pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 weapons use hostages as a live shield on the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of the involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures part of the biography of former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela, is being premiered in American cinemas.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of the legendary Francoise Pienaar rugby champion, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere the reactions of critics and the public are born
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Klerk.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they culminate in preparations for the world football championship. At the same time the media are shuddered by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of leading roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says, is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Often I met Nelson Mandela in person, for - as they say - to collect his energy, mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the outfit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years separate. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also wears the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the graffiti in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a recent interview with a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
On Mondaysko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
According to Pavla Mandatová, the company’s spokesman, the damage did not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly won't be possible before the fire goes out.
According to Mandatová it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
Čeps did not do anything similar during the ten years of the Čeps activity, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesman of the ČEZ society for Northern Czechy, the supplies of the electric current were not cut off, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps pąsobi in the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, and also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura submits a complaint for slander to three ČSSD-Hetmans
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today a complaint for slander to three social democratic hems.
These are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the hetman from Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company's effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dáhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the cake raisins," yet we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It is because of slander towards the society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
He said at the same time that he has the evidence of all the regions, and he said that they have not taken the necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint to be a continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as a free publicity for his company and himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I appeal to the other Germans to do so as well.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
It was necessary that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions agreed with České dáhy to maintain regional railway links and for the task of approximately 150 billion kroner did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a ČSSD deputy, I know, of which Mr, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumoccal vaccine will be free and voluntary.
The pneumoccal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcus culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already fixing the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts have already made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born from 2 August of last year will be able to receive the vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine should be received between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year, part four of the families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1,600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 kroner vaccines annually.
Without clutch they will save in treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state spent approximately 500,000 children's vaccinations every year.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
From pneumoccal infections in our country every year they die according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years old.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the children's cancer vaccine coverage was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example, pointed out Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association has been spreading the pneumoccal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path that we now have to go, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The president of the Pediatric Society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, they could be reasoned on the reduction of the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs so much, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
The experts hope that from the coming year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumoccal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "slay the money out of health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a remarkable amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of attempting to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 pictures into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the region of Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer stated that a family dispute might have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said that Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "dispersed" an opportunity to show its seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism of harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security spending and a 1% drop in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security spending, which will grow about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
BUDGET OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy will be contracted more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The increase of 1 point of corporation tax for small firms was rejected.
Tax reliefs for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £90, while a person earning £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the extra tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax increases and cut-offs were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large numbers. It will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," she told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount of borrowing and the speed at which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would likely contract at 4.75 % this year, much worse than the 3.5 % decrease forecasted in April, while the loan demand would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of the loan application for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, avoiding "cinically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had an opportunity to do so and they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the short term.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money collected from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sandsticks".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies in April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to allegations of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided the most needed and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Presupposedly false"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really delaying the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All major ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," Roger Bootle, Deloitte accountant's financial advisor, added.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
The FBI investigates "U.S. arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were detained in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said that the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as the disabled, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime's "models of abuse" before and after the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jameni, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"Faithful confession"
Amnesty International quoted the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"I often get hit in the face" according to his words.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied charges of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol interest site into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the track, but it was quite frightening.
It looks under a beautiful view of the city's lights flashing.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, a U.S. academic John Bowen has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's last work "Why French don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country over a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide 5-6 million French Muslims what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently worldly issues, it holds, things of daily life, those that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of Imams, professors and intellectuals, none of whom are renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arabic Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a fairer treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "an adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolating panorama of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who tested the value of facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The chicks, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still usually a millionth part of the area of a wild adult's area. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was greened by algae that grow within the hairless areas of its coat.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians in snowmobiles use high-power assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and frightening account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not like scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries gave a first indication of the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the ice cords moving under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals encamped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system inside the Arctic ice, made up of saltwater chorrits that are compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is withdrawn, what is believed can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in the tombs of Arlington
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood up in their boots.
In a few months, from where they're embarking, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, opened the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year by stopping in different cities along the way, to attend events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to older tombs of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Partnership for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read loudly carved names in the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped the tears out of their eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit Navy Gunner Sgto's tomb. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"Too much after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officers arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, state department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on customer projects such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything considered "of danger".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, which include mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied to him.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may likely cause tensions between the Castro communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost daily wages.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are among the bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the location of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He showed that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries start to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials riot a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, demonstrating that they expect the case to help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube web site.
Saifullah addressed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area at the Pakistan Tribal Belt, which is a familiar place for the Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing north-west mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason, they were rejected, said the official, who spoke since the anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said that the men did not move and were even trying to obtain adequate approval to access the al-Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani police authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has placed as the main priority its efforts to infiltrate people inside the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda is paying special attention to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years than they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding the negotiators working at the Bella Center Convention Center of the city, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day when little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists walked the city holding English banners that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "the Earth says "it's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru’s trips, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already taking place.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or by wearing pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for involvement in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence from a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Qualifications Book on Math Performance was a very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the rating book showed that fourth and eighth grade students had a faster rhythm than the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York over the past two years.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of fourth grade white students in D.C. over the past two years have grown from 262 to 270 (at a scale of 500), but their African-American peers have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The mean scores of the targets were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between fourth grade black and white pupils in 2003 when the first ENPE was announced in the District was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has hardly been reduced to 58.
Some District Education Lawyers expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by attending those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s style of administration, said the test score message is that the city’s secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see positive signs, and I respect that.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting neither the time nor the energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Every day mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth degree, emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think that we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here's a sort of dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education teacher at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that run counter to that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the middle black and white class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance gap is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It is necessary to reach almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which considers it a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong resurgence.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Wow, really?, he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion teacher-students of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to the university.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who have access to the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduated from university, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many parents also have high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with U.S. schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to implement university training programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to complete high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a leading role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have moved away from only two of the 10 submerged deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctions in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military retreats, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from taking a more vigorous risk in Iraq, which has the third most important stock of crude oil in the world, said analysts.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
The major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have bonded with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be close to its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that then faced the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a leading Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the kind operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistan Civil Intelligence Agency official, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking Qaeda military planner, who led terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy around the world, said a high official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratory attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the senior command of al-Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalololov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has decreased since summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to a story by The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to a tactics improved by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
The maximum UN envoy to Kabul is about to resign
The maximum United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would renounce his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by accusations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Presidential election in Afghanistan.
The exit from Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule that begins in 18 months drives other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who cooperate with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise that he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's best they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that the accusations of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "certainly harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, asserting that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to capture talents.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person from May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran to Face Additional Sanctions · Global Voices
The Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "additional significant sanctions" against Iran, for its failure to engage in talks on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we've learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would negotiate again on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in return for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and gaining time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the attempted agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that were actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set the deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before re-thinking other options, even continuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "deathful sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday's "unfounded and baseless accusations," by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was about to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in US projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them on the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, Wang said, 31-year-old, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after a single child's policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously sloppy children, single malcreated children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per pair, compared to the six of when the policy was implemented, according to the Division.
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to operate from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over counted almost 22 percent of the registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Commission on Family Planning and Municipal Population, has said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
Gradual relief
Composed of the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face enormous fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have miscarriage according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female proportion.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University's Demographic Research Institute, said that central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters that ordered families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and to slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very overwhelming.
Disappointing Response
While officials from a rural town outside Shanghai argue that they have observed a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 will only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they maintain, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrong view single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants a single son because she was also like, "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and really do not want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about having enough success to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years old grew up watching their parents fight during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, gained renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a timeless negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Elaborated by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, which include how developed economies and key emerging economies would cut down on their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature increase that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives him a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summed up a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut emissions by 2020 by between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The United States special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected statements requesting mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei stated that the U.S.'s ultimate climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically to face global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's main powers at stake, the failure lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The present battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should cost the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the large issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate maintained, who also works as regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants said that talks would bring about political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, drafted a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and require action by emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency while delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues must be resolved before the heads of government come to an end.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to delimit the complaints that will be arbitrarily made during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (on which every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, guitar-playing activists present night shows mocking the countries that they believe are being sold, and hand-in-hand preliminary proposals are passed instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 kmh train redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 kmh, when it passes like a beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He expects the new service to finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The careless remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the switch of aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national emissions of coal, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still curb Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will hand over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be plotted within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favored option being proposed is an Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Penines to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," a member of the railway said.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour ago.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km/h, turning the British network into the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions on the capital's space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work starts, the network would have to be built into sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the quick lines along the lanes in the north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived " rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to pay the extra interest, bringing in hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and were not consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who led a review of the costs of the members. Mr. Duncan said last night that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a town in his election district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "orangel".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent inquiry by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271.406 of his property in London to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately GBP 1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan's mortgage interest rate did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of £75.000.
The standard variable mortgage type of the BRE dropped from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, which is now the type.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the opposition of the House in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive " rations" after the scandal of spending.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live with rations and be treated like m**rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling pound symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when they asked him about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved by both the pay office and later by Legg."
He added: "It's not about circumventing and criminalizing or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Avenue of the beach palapa of Brighton
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for each December, using villainics as their theme.
The event began on December 1st, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm every day, with stuffed cakes and free ponche served.
The chosen villains so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect people to come to an old strange building as a Church? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the event calendar of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change will reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with adoquines and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially those of members of the Black Bloques, ultra violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took place at the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them with celestial rainforests responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to call Friends of Earth to form "blue apples" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said the benign singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that are drying, watercourses that can be walked as never before had been done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "join climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-off to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dresses in red and clad with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters called for strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (Sur), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Tens of people were concentrated in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow over a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "sorry that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow's support, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus a vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round of two weeks will be organised later.
Climate: events in the world, events in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen climate change conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, seeking an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, largely peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
Protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the center, not trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police surrounded them quickly and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the Black Bloques, ultraviolet groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adoquin, and four cars were burned near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups are not blindfolded, I warn the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them with celestial rainforests responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to call Friends of Earth to form "blue apples" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-off to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed dresses in red and polishing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Filipino capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters called for action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (Sur), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would emerge "fortified" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelor's degree.
From now on, all pupils in the first degree will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "suffering with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "brain C is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally calls the best students."
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be submerged from C, it continues to emphasize even: "I also heard that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in second degree in technological schools."
A IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French of ten (69%) disapproved of the government project of eliminating the compulsory teaching of history-geography in second degree C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the Second Bacterial Programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), early in the year, they will provide an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and by the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also do practice in real conditions during the year M2, then they will be a first year in front of the class as teachers in practice.
If you make all the practical proposals before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, i.e. more than 300 hours, you added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal Superior School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, a challenge that accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by Ulm Street’s Normal Superior School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the conference wheel "Ernest", a day consisting of a series of presentations by 15-minute experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and conveys them wanting to know more, explained in the framework of the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," she told AFP Jean Jouzel, who exhibited without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of some fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed the hope that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a highly serious scientific record."
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's Internet site as of December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust between prison guards, action is planned
The prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to require payment before the end of the year, the premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers' Force (2nd union of guards) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block" them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) summons them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve mass mobilization", since it makes "dishonourable and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first watch union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Office of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I called on the Bureau of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budget requirements," deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional FO union of Marseilles outraged, announcing its decision to boycott to new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threats FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time of increasing our tasks and missions without taking more force, it is rather regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the prison CGT of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, not all regions do the same, as some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not expected, said the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he does "better gifts" than those he receives.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion on gifts: "I make better gifts than those I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be out of the question.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the program extracts transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," she said, provoking the president.
It's true, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of settling them around the house, however, I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-opted, RTL claims he's in induced coma.
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to important "injurys" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his close friends, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker intervened again on Wednesday evenings on Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where some doctors found "injury resulting from the operation" of a discal hernia held in Paris on November 26, noting his press service in the same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repairing operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquillity claiming that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would communicate within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, interrogated by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" he would not have been introduced to any cannula after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said he was not "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to get 12 hours of plane after such an operation, it's not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to reassure himself that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days, resulting in a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to a general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "column cancer," after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, each health problem has been overly commented on. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the 2009 Worlds of Long Pool, obtained an international title on Thursday in a distance that feels particularly affectionate, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, in which the polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that he owns in a long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet advanced himself to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimmers from January 1 will be banned.
These swimmers, originating in 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimmers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew this time I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola was sold in USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday in 1.5 million dollars, far above the estimated price, announced the art merchant of Sotheby's.
This panel of 2 meters long for 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satirical and drunken women, is an uncommon piece, since in the world there are only four or five", explained Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most uploaded by buyers, without any doubt, pointed out to AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bath in his private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before the Marshal Pétain took power.
For about 50 years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an open "Emile Zola Sucession" in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborted Zelaya Exit to Mexico · Global Voices
On Thursday Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the couppista government denied the safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, declared Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The plane of the Mexican government that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as head of state in an invited exercise.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign my office (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday at Globo radio, in which he usually makes statements since the start of the political crisis that has taken five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe driving, but unfortunately we were unable to accept it because we did not have a request for asylum, on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he underlined.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized Wednesday to the supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup's position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must respond to the Justice for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress massively voted against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office ended on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market concentrated "in the medium full glass."
For Peter Cardillo, by Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of volumes of trade, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the main economies that market with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were made.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year-old Treasury bond yield was 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year-old bond yield was 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power abuse the "Damas de Blanco"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power abused the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world human rights day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Lamas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they walked to the centre of the capital claiming the release of these detainees, a journalist from AFP said.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" they coerced with their fists on high the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed in civilian clothes who came to protect them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Damas de Blanco" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who also hurried to protest on Thursday for the international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported an AFP journalist.
The officers forced the vehicles to the dissidents who were abused by supporters of the government, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents under similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco", awarded with the Sakharov Prize 2005 awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solicit the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call on the opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" to pay for their declared enemy, the United States.
Made very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
One alien killed an octogenarian with a knife and left 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne on Thursday at the hour of the greatest influx of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an old man, in the pharmacy or in front of the pharmacy at No. 85 of the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to one responsible for the Alliance police union.
Later in the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, came in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is at risk.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and a 40-year-old man seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying crusades on his back, explained in the place a union leader Alliance in the Hauts del Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, tried to control the alienate, according to the testimony obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
For the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded at punches, according to the testimony of the police.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man in the street who was wounded.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. As I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, he told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of approximately 35 years arrived, with knife wounds.
National police arrested the man without identity papers.
The Office of the Procurator of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Police Judicial Police of the Hauts del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his temporary detention, he has not spoken.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexciting" as "all of this kind's disordered whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a case of sexual abuse over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", reported to three judges of the Second District of California Appeals Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the judge's conduct in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before issuing a sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), of the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the documentary's author.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court denied the dismissal of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as Roman Polanski had not been brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a person under 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles District Vice Marshal Phyllis Asayama declared that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself to the audience."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?" Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "calls a favor to the court, although he despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case is raised, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by US arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, pending extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and stops at the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday without a course, in a market that is being debated between better indicators than those expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63 per cent, but Nasdaq lost 0.03 per cent.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the soundness of economic reactivation", Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months compared to the euro, which "brings down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
Ten-year-old Treasury bond yields amounted to 3.540 per cent compared to 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and 30-year bond yields to 4.497 per cent on Thursday night.
Miss World's Choice Again in South Africa
After a month of tour around South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World’s title are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Mexican Beltran Pearl, Mariatu Karglo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportist or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and I lived countless experiences!, said amazement Miss Sierra Leone.
This event, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very glad that I have lived twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of re-discovering "African landscapes that take off the breath".
After a month of rallies, rehearsals, press wheels and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
China's host, Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African President, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will certainly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I tried with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastically Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, distended, assured that he would move to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection derived from the discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus being able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, followed by a discal hernia operation on 26 November last in Paris.
The singer was operated again the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer from AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic at Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "travelled too fast to Los Angeles with permission from the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, because I was operated twice as a discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before at the RTL station, he indicated that the singer apparently had "god without cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened in actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a haematoma formed as a result of cerebral bleeding.
He is a doctor with bad reputation, condemned for justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" demanded "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Undoubtedly, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, said Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF Association (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democrat Movement) by François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the seal of the former giscardist party, inviting him to withdraw it from all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF logo, since he believes that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political inheritance after holding his hand to the left.
Moreover, the Defence Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, he was assisted by the deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence in order to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy intimidating them to renounce the seal and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, subject to a sentence of judicial appeal.
These last few days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also think it's right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New Center+, and today's +UDF slogan on its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, support the signatories of the letter.
As you know, they have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF office which requires the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (its) website."
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the right-wing people".
Failure to do so will call on justice to enforce respect for the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elect" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, in their view, to use the UDF logo.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", it was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Take scandalous and fraudulent advantage of the lack of registration of the UDF acronym to perform it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which it is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to bring the artist François-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to expoliate her from a part of her fortune.
62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars in the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
However, the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Physicians designated on Friday will be required to report by March 10, 2010, in which they will have to record whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from states of weakness and during what periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, on leaving the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer Olivier Metzner was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter began criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the outcome of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the allegations of the lawyers were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he mistrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since his wedding, I've never been able to speak to Françoise again."
On the other hand, the Office of the Prosecutor of Nanterre considered, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, even more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to make a request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person can appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as it was previously intended to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave place to the strategies of conquering the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the customer's preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and even more, of business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and a forward-looking vision"; it requires employees to make a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would be to put the partners at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among its employees, encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the ancient behavioral theory that the American "neurosciences" reactivated recently, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent research of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanistic management, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It is about integrating in all reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motiveuntional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a default doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate the management of human resources "in place."
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "fair war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the U.S. right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States, acclaimed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives was happy, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historical, said Gingrich, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider to be a possible candidate for the republican investiture for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama spoke "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as "a citizen of the world", as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right-wing, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking inspiration" on the National Review Online Internet site.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left centre press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his "overproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the discourse that was necessary," said the New York Times, judging him "as both gloomy and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were fired at Friday morning in the hope of promptly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very damaging to companies" and "was feared to disrupt the end of the year parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there can always be some disobedient rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense that respects the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general meetings of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will above all address the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' expenses" was the subject of a government amendment in the Financial Corrections Bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will request the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, first, to companies affiliated to this organization and, second, to the whole profession, in case the Minister of Labour expands.
It will be "with the greatest speed," said Bussereau.
Opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that this was a "genuine trade", since the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Nochebuena dinner, the Unostra was regretted.
For the ESTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, counter-trade unions with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because in the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to their premium request.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10am and 8pm, due to one train each in the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to switch trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "RATP strives to provide service to large stores."
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallee.
This Friday, approximately one train in every two trains traveled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as expected.
Thursday there was no disorder in the Andens thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to get on schedule".
Station Saint-Lazare was not saturated, said SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RERs operated by SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or destined for this purpose came or left Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The RER director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers want that claim a premium that is due to them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even in parentheses its premium proposals, said the CGT was outraged, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," RATP said.
What also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the address, which was denied until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents presented a warning.
Trade unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line which has one million passengers per day.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurd party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the main prokurd party of the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that adversely affect the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, declared to the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, said Kiliz, and added that 37 of the party leaders, including his president Ahmet Türk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they became MPs without a partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Tribunal's verdict intervenes at the time the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the Southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order's Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters dropped Molotov bombs or stones with hooligans.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "deepen the discouraging."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, it declared to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
Thus nothing is resolved, declared the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK launched an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowstorms can begin suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
At all events it's something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the EDF
But with this your employees can learn to test and master the whole vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time on the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections come out with large salt vehicles, explains Brauburger.
For example, main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the accesses for firefighters' bodies, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and slope sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three o'clock in the morning.
About 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours of wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES begins around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the rush hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear the salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belongs to Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and secondary streets.
That's where the nuisances are generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, with the most dangerous points and cruises being cleared.
The EDF could not usually take over the entire bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salt vehicle starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on the two strong rear legs, had an enlarged head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with hoez-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been anything special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were gathered in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the saurios were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnivorous teropods among those found in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (saurios con pelvis de ave), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's and his colleagues' analysis, Tawa hallae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of airbags, such as those of the descendants of the terpods, the birds.
Thanks to airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa finds also the bones of the spine were evidently filled with partial air.
Tawa is the teropod with older and primitive airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the paired line of the later giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurios came out there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines were separated at the beginning and extended from South America through all corners of the Earth, which at that time was still a unique earthly mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa find the remains of two other teropods not very closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single parented ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many fossils of dinosaurs continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurus and many other saurios.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship was extinguished at the Triassic limit towards the Jurassic.
Successful Stories Were Not Eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, Martin Sander comments.
A massive extinction could have been given to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a brake meteorite impact the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna, and Berkeley, California, are attending.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt had an impact around the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English, "reject" the police eviction promoted by the governing board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented a "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimization and criminalize the protest" and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Protest legitimized
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also sympathize with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the university and police director.
We're grateful to the university principal.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are dislodged.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a place heavily guarded for secret investigation of armaments.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from central Moscow, is considered to be the "Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Close Collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Deputy Mayor of Moscovita Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the planning services chief Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of FIZ and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with trade relations.
FIZ's companies will have the opportunity to put a foot on the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian research companies and institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Social Planning City" for arms investigation.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The Dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not placed at all high enough.
For the project's supporters it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rieles, which ended in the middle of the city, were considered at that time 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since it was formerly necessary a huge amount of time to anchor the locomotives from back to forth.
Roll, stop in dry continue the journey; but so must it be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located approximately half the way through the trans-European lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Corazón de Europa".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unmissable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals do not, of course, have any more entrance and exit problems, as long as there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built ICE towards Ulm will already be initiated.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that done by trucks on the roads.
However, the new stages under construction are good for cargo trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
The experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long streams across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the slow pace route has been constructed.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the ruling on the airport.
The federal government remains in Wiesbaden's autonomous parliament, if it is to file an appeal before the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court in Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the ruling of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the north-west runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January whether it will bring an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their pledges to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be trying through distortions of law and tricks still obtain their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a long time.
The coalition would not like to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally untouchable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group's assertions about the ban on night air traffic.
U.S. banks pay back the aid they borrowed.
The major U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state ties.
The Bank of America only paid back the aid provided by the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by the CNBC of the United States.
With this, the institutes seek to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone out of hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had achieved approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to raise money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the U.S. bank could announce by this Thursday the increase in its capital for $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF administrative board (German television channel) presses on the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Yesterday night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main study of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this on the part of the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, the Schächter candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet complete at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the administrative board already weeks before the election had indicated that they were not going to support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor had been organised by the president of the government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
Another mandate of the prestigious editor declined with the argument, that under Brender's direction the ZDF information would have lost hearing rates.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which political influence over the ZDF was flogged.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law, who described the course of Koch as unconstitutional, had become involved in the debate.
But it didn't do anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgengamazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, who was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Media Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federated states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of politicians in support of the ZDF control guilds was rejected by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a second party.
In the estimates of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the left-wing liberals.
University courses take off
Partial success for students: after a year of educational-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of degree and master's degree.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each career module must complete with a single examination.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making the structural rules in conjunction for Bachelor and Master careers more flexible.
The rules of the federated states which diverge from this must no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and university directors are constantly talking about improving the ability to successfully complete and complete a career (study).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module completes a single examination", it is said in a 30-page document, which seeks to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
The aim of the "sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" is to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the Accreditation Council, Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary student restrictions in the choice of..
courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, enabling and encouraging their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These should be "recognized" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
The responsibility for this would be at the country-wide level of 10 Accreditation Agencies, under the supervision of the Accreditation Council, which is set up by the federated states.
Ministers of education and culture called on the federated states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate has ensured that additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process are made available.
With this money universities must implement student mentoring and counselling programs, as well as strengthen exam offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, it should be sufficient only one exam for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, and the recognition of assessments at other universities and accessibility to the Master should be ensured.
Until the end of next year we intend to examine all the careers about its "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the praises, there were also criticisms of the decisions.
The board of directors at the federal level of the Jewish university groups (social youth) was demanding that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, now students as main participants should be able to think about it as well.
The president of the Board of University Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the student experience," said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a later Master's degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that enough study places for Master are available for the current generation of Bachelor students in the future with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But regarding greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is almost out of control" says the first line of a poem by the lyrical Werner Söllner in disequilibrating idiomatic fragments, in which he feared the experiences of arriving in Germany experienced by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several awards in literature, in 1993 he taught the memorable lessons or lectures of poetry in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God to speak quite the last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his files from Security"
Visiblely insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Secret Service Security in front of fellow German-Roman writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who has not defended himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke fear of Security," Söllner concluded.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and especially the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abysses and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know so far, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his file on Security IM Walter he had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable shelter for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly " Zeit" after having read her own 914 pages.
Those involved would surely have speculated and would have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a procedure controlled in Germany, the treatment with the security control files is still fairly widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of Security Records (CNSAS) was formed for the Birthler Authority in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is more to be traced.
Since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former Chief of the Security of Temesvar spoke specifically of the decorated one.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be unturned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so many times when there is silent guilt.
Why just now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desires of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Mercedes taxi from Class C a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the bald characteristic had hired a driver, because he had not yet known the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old man drunk of joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth finals", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:13 triumph against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important land" expected them on the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Chance
The eighth finals of the Champions League (parties from 16/17 and 23/24 February/retour 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy remained limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired the bewildered professors of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willing to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained the repairer of Gross souls his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had effect.
He unfolded a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a break of several weeks due to an injury, immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had evidently been missing when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constancy.
Like Gross, players and the administrator also abstained from overestimating the triumph against a weakened defense for lack of relief and totally overrun by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, thought Khedira.
And Chief Horst Heldt warned that while one of the season's goals had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his home for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had granted the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the governing board, which had decided to change from coach to pressure from teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt rejected, and announced consequences for the latter.
They're probably not friends anymore, the two quarentons.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the previous efforts with the replacement coach team, it would not have been possible to show the great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed with the man in the plastic case.
Fighting the world heavyweight championship
Ardent grief in Bern: once and again the retractor Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday night to Saturday in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the damage that everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to give up due to his injuries.
Dr. Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
Before some 17000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was dodging over and over the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not bring decisively to his goal his dangerous right.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a retractor, and he just tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who held twelve rounds complete with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the docker had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "doesn't know how to do anything."
When weighing, the champion was allowed on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later won in his defenses of the title Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one blow, and I'm in very good physical condition, I had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after it destroyed Nikolai Valujev in November, 2.13 metres tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar, due to false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about the Kunduz air strike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), who has been deceiving with knowledge of the cause.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcasted by the television channel ARD, the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: He said lies.
The killing order would have been disregarded by the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report by NATO, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the foreign minister, the army and the information service have approved this new strategy, asked Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The Foreign Ministry did not have any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the background of the two senior officials, he transcended that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, no response has been received, it has been said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday with regard to the complaints made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Oniric Worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill and drug addicts, the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during the sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhinder the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during watchfulness, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are considered most of the time in the modern Western world as a madman or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
Guilt is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality blur.
The dreamly-modified alert states can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been unbalanced – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since the ancient era.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance to the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispropossessessed formations, and mirrors of this one".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of devils with wings, with red flies like blood, deformed, bowing their teeth.
They are chasing him, kick him with heavy and flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains throughout the body.
Strident and malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
You can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and offend you.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, ties them to form a hanger knot, and locks them on a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs into a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
What a lesson it is to you!, shout the voices in a choir that brings back the timps, "Go to the clinic and make them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, besides it is manic-depressive, taking drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned how to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; psychiatric clinics treat it as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what matters what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic of the university hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics are often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it's still an incognito why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a temporary basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
Researchers assume the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this neuronal system alteration occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis, as they interfere with the transmission system of the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical thing about this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor in Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
The perception of hallucination as pleasant or does not often depend on the point of view.
Kasten collected reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and craneoencephalic traumas .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
It emerges when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or low-cooked; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and went to a high school.
A common girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, a torpedo boy with long dark hair leads the word.
When she answers her, the other students look at her minded; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the timid girl is a bit strange dreamy, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the other visions are not real and disappear.
At night, apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often arrives late and is scarce, it does not know whether it is waking or dreaming, if the images you see, the flies or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, call out to the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they'd think he was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. She's 20 today.
Last year he approved selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Ever since you've been in contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or has a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain finds itself unoccupied and takes care of the same thing as looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls his father since he is using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, to those affected as Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of the hospital Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers to be real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathia, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world of its own and imaginary that is uncoupled from reality.
A form of dream and hallucination limiting situation.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an insurmountable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into anything of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of saving the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his consciousness embarked on trips several days after an operation of heart transplant heart valves, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of old: he saw himself laid down in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was looking after his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snowflakes and met with a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describing your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burde
Children will take charge of the editorial at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, aged 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put 7500 workers before his children, if they are not sufficiently qualified to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the Presidency of the Board of Directors as of January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52 has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took charge of the treasury and thus took responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the peak of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," Burda said.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from the decline either: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the pursuit of capital search, who have judged badly and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had "great deliriums," Burda says.
I do not see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, nor do I want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral Beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within your reach.
This is what seems to have been proposed by The English Court, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious companies such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with over 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibrational platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the customer's steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all muscles of your body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair recovery, brightness or nutrition in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m. at night.
Miscellaneous Listenings
Christmas is coming and it is never more to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we should consider.
There are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electrical company, together with the City of Barcelona, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Electric Vehicle Implantation Logistics) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVEL Plan, to boost the installation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in promoting the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a picture of abandonment, closure of some of our main productive plants," the president of the government said.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3 billion.
The Chief of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized governmental demand-support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew by "40%" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motor mountain fans.
This initiative will take place during February 5-7, 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will classic motorcycles and cars be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
In this way, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, add-ons, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found among the pavilion exhibitors.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be: Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Puache sale and restoration of cars; or Classic Cochera, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior skill tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sports are not based on respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system -named as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note reached throughout its whole.
Finishes, vehicle termination, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the driving position, we found that the front cuffs present an excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following with the set formed by the toolbox and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, to which the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the petrol engine of two liters and 150 horses and with the manual change of six gears.
This engine is an authentic delight. It is especially important for its finish, for its low noise, for the performance and for achieving a content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the equipment level, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. that incorporates a larger number of standard elements.
Of the series equipment especially the rail switch assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive inner mirror, the computer on board on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy tires.
In addition, in the case of little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: ixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It especially highlights the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers per year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is located between the 21.770 euros of Luxury finish and the 23.270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were more dazzled than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' in the 'Nine' premiere. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has taken out two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in exchange for paying six more times for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your US counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and would have to be running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The repeated eardrops of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That an apparatus like FonPeek (it is not surprising that it takes Fon's name when it doesn't have WiFi) to get this type of fare means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no cages.
It is a connected device and is paid for it when buying it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a life-access shopping option like the one Peek already has in America.
Not because I'm buying it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this system.
Michelle's fetish color
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If you have already gone to the takeover of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany him in undoubtedly the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections -, the outfit was made of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vesturium.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of it it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with stamped.
The complements have also varied: half heels green shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, melena loose the previous.
75 per cent of working mothers have had labour problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fequendity and work history of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey carried out between 9,737 women aged 15 and 75 has no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited employment opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they do.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start partnering earlier, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are lagging behind coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged between 35 and 49 years old with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs has required more time from their vital trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on motherhood, though less on the calendar of matching," explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and when they have the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the older the age at which they marry and the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"An additional division is established among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a pre-marriage condition and the arrival of a child", Delgado detail.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, singing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, thus joins other famous filming of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longonia and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Losted') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, from yesterday and today - met in the annual award ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one left on the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicente's Poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty radiographs of writers who have spent their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearful genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The trip has its excitements and Vincent does not save either the sound or the lighting.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and rereadings.
I'll leave you a few moments here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same as I felt without a name: the pleasure against acile destiny, blameless morals and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a Christian allegorical, wrote what he had in blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic mood, like the blade blade that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be climbed by the north wall, from which the best mountaineers take over again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was heir to a landlord in the county and to others that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry from a bridge by that character of Munich to carry his echo to the bottom of the 20th century under his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he fell on his knees and prayed, 'Oh, my God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "These verses of Spenser were recorded on his grave: 'The dream after effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after war,/ after the sick life pleased death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a case of such a patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Saintos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to get to Baroja for Faulkner's guns?
What did Cell do but abhor that man's fame so that he could serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada municipality when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a mixed-breededed specimen, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, punched her with two kicks that left the dog badly wounded.
Our indignation is capitalistic because we do not find fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a lady who walked quietly and who, when she cremated these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, as an energism that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday whatever by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt that it serves much and not to generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the coward killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat free of charge a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest drivers, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while travelling on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, that "it goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as it is a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Up the sale of light trades
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decreases, according to figures of the employers of the Anfac manufacturers and that of the sellers Gavan.
The good, not obstinate, data should be quarantined, since the reference to which comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% drop over the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold in addition to all vehicles that make up the sash box of light commercials: tourism derivatives, pick ups, vans, light vans and trucks/lightchases.
Also, nubarrons that most affect their demand have not disappeared, although they are also acquired by private individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the economic situation need to be added to the constraints of the closed tap on bank credits.
In view of this and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been scarcely used.
In addition to individuals, they can be welcomed by self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to acquire a lightweight trader of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam again recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock and ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of working, it can also help avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pedestrian that the driver gives.
But this does not always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car in stopping.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four claims would be avoided with damage to people - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delays the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figuereulas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - day 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, GM Europe's new president, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made within the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but it takes on strength the choice of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To unravel their last, and dear jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce it no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, from the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'caen' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they won 7 kilos more; mounting another 12 sports boats and with the 19-inch, five-inch, light tires.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door shooters to some of the fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly for secondary California roads, in mountain sections with really swivel traces
Your behavior can only be described as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not tilt the asphalt with aplomb.
On the contrary, it had been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, it transmitted so much security in the passage through the curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short march for the time needed, until we order him to sprint, brake, retrieve and reexpress his motor...
What we ask of you. Thanks to your direction, as communicative as accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Free-to-use engine sound
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine brazing, already previously premiered in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car turned the tanks well.
Electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving you can in the market and that is something more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be put for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Cocoon line and 'starlette' occasionally of the parades of the 'maison', the singer produces her face of malotte with as much contumacy as her bags of Chanel.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
The Baskonia Gives a Victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a brilliant victory for 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team was counted, and in this way he placed himself in the leadership of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triple ratings was the best of his team (29 ratings).
The Victorian team was able to supplant the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas, or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although they had to suffer until the end in order to achieve victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triple notes had much to do with the final triumph.
The party started face to face for the bluegranes, which were put from the beginning in front of the scorer.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it presage that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot wrists..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more of the same, but the team went on to opt for the inner game of Barak and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pits and applause on the return to which his house was, to continue to widen his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' rating Splitter already made presage that this wasn't going to be the best night of Brazilian.
But the party, despite being carried on to rest, was no less determined, and the macabeans wanted to remind the victorians that they won no one in their court, and with 'Elias's hand' pressingly managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow' turning the light (50-49).
More inconvenient
Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed a couple of games to be successfully played to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alavesses went out to leave their skin in the last part and English and St. Emetery (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not rescind and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Lesions prevent the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost to the Olympics in Greece and gave him the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a match marked by the casualties of the cashiers, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and also by the rival's entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, lit the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacians were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, they turned to the scorer 22-20, minute 13, when an action, pussy fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the fall by injury of the English pivovot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were beating the cashiers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible rebound
The third period was very offensive to the Olympians, who despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even came to equalize the difference of the encounter disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group stagger.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last downfall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for Cook's leadership and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacs when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian Pívot Nikola Vujcic managed to go back to basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, delivering the leadership to the Olympiacs.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the searcher with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been running, the searcher has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels badly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data from Trovit of his searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31.059, compared to the 24,000 receiving one Spanish.
In the same way, a driver charges EUR 34,247 net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil puts a date on the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall leave diplomatic ties by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when he or she would formally complete his or her term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business for the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that it must leave before that date of the embassy, where it remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when he ends his term of office, he has to seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he attempted to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya as a political asylum which was intended to impose on him the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again the uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not surprise since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was monetizing debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar to rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they begin to lay some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its auction year by week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the shelter chosen by the investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the countries of the eurozone with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that it arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not come wrong to silence the moral risk defenders who were trying to re-create awareness of those responsible for global economic policy because they have stopped the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle among the Emirs to recompose power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls from the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within what is expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials extend as well as European corporate bonds, we must not worry.
If the European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, who return to the cargo with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not hope for life to be warned.
Again, it has all the color that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, friend driver".

Iberdrola's president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is debated these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a brushed-up of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but at international distribution networks and interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and power needs to be increased.
Its commitment focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that we need 18,000 MW new, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "points" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must start to be taken already, they are slow to mature and a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus's 'handling' at ten airports
The railway subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of a preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most outstanding.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been exceeded, lasts for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the Alcalá University of Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
The action of his first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It fights for its first concession highway in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1,7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
French Bouygues and sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Ancia to sit in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP for its acronyms in English) to proceed the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to US$ 1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase they compete with three consortia with notable presence of European construction companies.
The group named as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the screen is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (affilial of the German constructor Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatisations, but it leads to a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the cited Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the cited Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalation business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide derailer, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies in order to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the western Toowong highway with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. It is the greatest performance to reduce congestion in the Brisbane traffic.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets out the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this step of payment would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that he had obtained a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The participation of ACS will enable, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide quick access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will give jobs to German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will share the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its Alpine branch, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The signature achieves this contract days after it is done with the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The work is scheduled to commence in early 2010 and will run for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awards Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros a year, the railway operator said.
The contract reflects the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition called by Renfe of which four were left finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited fixed and mobile telephony competition by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting up obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and that it is therefore re-incidence.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that more money has won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So far, the competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well standing out of this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that more money has been embolsed for participation, and the only one, next to AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the former Europe Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the ranking.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, the two teams that also paid more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Layout
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, Michel Platini's governing body plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There are also bonuses to win (€800,000) and tie (€400,000 for each team).The eight-finalists will receive three million each; the eight-fourth-finalists, $3.3 million.
The last four will be packed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, took 2.5 million to win the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which $337.8 million is allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places, and it has four assigned places.
The champion of the previous year is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group yesterday degreased the details of the offer to purchase shares with which it pursues a hit of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and would be remunerated with an interest in this postponement of 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos's shares closed to 1,85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer valued the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezan group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to be realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is of 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and the judicial vavenes of his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a new creation post that will be directly dependent on the chairman of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of over 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, ex-Advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) told yesterday that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes paternina's exclusion opa, which was presented by Investora Mer.
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion opa presented by Investor Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation when it considers that its terms are in line with the current rules and considers the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation in the Madrid and Bilbao scholarships.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been held, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions in force.
New tools for perishing cars
In these days of temporary and accident, not only do the car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister one are towed to a workshop, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and what the repair cost will be.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the costs of parts and the time of labor can be a long and complicated work.
Calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and workman, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent IT tools, it would be a matter of deminutiveness.
That's why almost 100% of experts use this kind of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the valuation of claims and maintenance are engaged in collecting the information that manufacturers provide to them, and then develop it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other signatures that compete in the field of charging and information-processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
Moreover, the amount of data to be tried is increasing, to the extent that more versions, variants andmotorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes to market, these companies start to work.
It is a very hard task, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle have to be catalogued and introduced.
In addition, a graphic "intelligent" image is made of each model, where different parts of tourism can be "hipped".
If it's a fan model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As far as the mobile park is concerned, it is up to 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and database development, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to make different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for handling scrap pieces or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that professionals in the sector can provide.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinister valuation solution, intended for experts.
Includes light or heavy industrial cars, motorcycles and vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to usage, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it a little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its built-in number.
AudaGlass is concentrated on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to upload for vehicles declared to total sinister.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geodemographic analyses or know deviations by omodel marks.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to faults or how many have suffered serious damage in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the valuation of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Rating Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 it billed 10,8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year his internationalization process began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of their business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion in stock exchange, and now its shares are valued at $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 quoted in the New York Stock Exchange and included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of accidental cars
Last October the group Solera bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded in the next year to 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This sales and valuation service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrappings and professional sellers that must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and manages over 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.

Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for replacement, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are often more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourisms, 109 all-terrestrials, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired using its built-in number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, charges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between both systems is that workshop orientation does not include estimated manpower times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
