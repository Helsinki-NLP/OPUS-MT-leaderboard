Sounds like a typical rugby club to me.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is big of anything...
Finally, we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break anyone's nose during the games to drink (in the end, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme that says so.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed quite typical to me.
Having said that, this new information leaves no doubt in my view that they go much further than misogyne jokes and jokes under the hold of alcohol that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to cause as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But come on, why let your prejudices and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students of these schools for whom rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, former boys from the private.
From very different backgrounds to those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So "misogynist jokes" are acceptable?
It looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races across campus, theft, damage to property and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: tell yourself that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
therefore also ancestral this interstellar cloud (e.g., not traditional:))
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of the water in your pastis is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, well one can at all times consider that the pie fleet has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad already that it is.
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophic and reheaters of any fur that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
Unrefutable proof that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see Serge Ferry's remarkable work funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is evidence that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I believe Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Uh, and for second degree and irony, what do you have for signage?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for "disasters" as you say to be concerned about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the freshwater that accounts for less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not the most threatening climate warming for our species, but especially the reduction of little or no renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly gourmet lifestyles.
As for the study that you quote and whose generous effort you make to quote the source, we naturally doubt the truthfulness of the conclusion.
Regarding the problems of fresh water, I reassure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you have to stop considering ecology as a faultless dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimate 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, not thank you.
"Then it is necessary to stop considering ecology as a faultless dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, at last it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that through the action of the oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of greenhouse exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 bonhos would have come to the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever that might be?
I'm probably not!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving backwards, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of that village idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any allowable climate model gives priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora throughout the world.
Looks like this scientific fact has never been made available.
Did you see the Green Army somewhere?
Don't do anything, my dear government.
The levels of CO2 increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is only a faulty distraction.
And before you throw your glass at the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is flawed and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was most beneficial, it is now being invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back up to the marginal electorate.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants perform less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people have to eat them in far greater quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this member of Parliament is a child is obvious.
Until now, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from departing from the rules of the XVIIth.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible to the world, even if the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That lady doing a whole thing of her own isn't in her honor, it looks mostly like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Académie" had failed: "Let's say Mrs.Sceaux guard or guard" (post that until then had never been occupied by a woman).
It's just machismo!
"The political arena " ...!
The sand basin, the backyard of the Republic is filled, the marigot of the operetta gulants, the table of illusions, etc.
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly, badly.
Qd the Phallocrat is seated on the label and the parliamentary regulation by making the + elementary civilization under the false umbrella of the good manners, the penalty applies to him "is quality" for his partisan stubbornness and his use of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making provocation to make him talk about it.
Until now he was unknown, now he can be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class is known.
The good back academy, and you can see that the MPs are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to be careful to resolve its internal problems and stop causing the couches and scandals.
The Academy has good backs, especially when she's told what she doesn't say.
This Member of Parliament acts as a college member in the midst of the teenage crisis, who is provocative and whose partners go,in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel the college hours.
and by defending him on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even make up 15% of the signatories to this UMP forum.
Judge, I call on two expert witnesses only a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, seamen, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure it gives them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are passionate about the majority of our 80 years working, moving and doing stores.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply our lifespan by two, but we spend most of it in boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily implies a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I want to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I adhere to the idea that we hear a lot of bullshit about animals who are "playing" while they are just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it can be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play at the basis of any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman was not an object, he might not have raped her."Maybe yes, hope made her live...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the info without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite excited about those who appear crazy at first glance.
But when you see what many have learned at school, especially among the most likely public to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of an anchor point.
"the most likely public to engage in violence against women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thought patterns.
It's true that golden youth from Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
The silvery youth of Evry too!
If the reacs no longer responded, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything from this at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Must I be feeling lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you don't know how to read?
And is it that young socialists go to suburban schools to teach equality between men and women?
It would be more effective than doing moralising montages on Twitter, but you should get out of the beautiful neighbourhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They are nil everywhere but to teach morals, it remains the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article won't let go.
It's not time to make jokes about the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have done a double-sensing word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill a 90-year-old's stomach in a retirement home.
How come the more we pay, the less we have it in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a monastery?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more food.
Of course, it does not have to be that way.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more you are likely to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they made the effort to put on some carpets.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good food?
The Manif for All is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's what it is: a kind of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "children's manufacturing".
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or made by technological equipment.
Batteries breeding?
That's where you get that from.
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacturing", we must demand the ban on the LDCs for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am surprised, moreover, that the so-called "for all" manifesto does not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that they are not the only cathos who manifest themselves: the other religions too, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all changes in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanlop was violently insurgent against the gvt's will to admit girls to school in the name of "the defense of the family".
We are still in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents screamed at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is to say the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be catho to indignant yourself about the marketing of stomachs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops with that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other as much as others.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this is also valid for heterosexuals looking for GPA.
I just can't be able to love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of foolishness, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, besides Heskey, who plays as many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article speaks of the goals it has marked, I will not speak of the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa do not bring or bring anything), but perhaps it would be another reason for which it has gained much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommend 119 It is in the way of criticizing Rooney right now so we can forgive you to do so too.
That said it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In fact, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the football or if you think Peter Crouch A would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had had as many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's abilities come from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected on a regular basis in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's and Peter Crouch's (even non-attacking) soccer qualities?
You do that without a joke?
There really are people completely in the crowd.
Please note also that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his team career in England.
Instead, he played the front retreat, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that by jokes.
In a country where the weapon port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way of proceeding.
Well, those in this school aren't exactly in agreement with the U.S. weapons port authorization!
the use of the pencil is still suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids are playing with fake guns at this age at our home?
Is that a murderous person in power anyway?
Even though the port of arms is in the American constitution and this necessarily affects the country's culture, I do not believe that the rich children are significantly different from ours.
A little common sense and reason kept svn.
It's a disarming process!
Rendezvous, you've got yourself locked up!
The information about this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not have, premixes to the taste of morbid.
Could we assume that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of five?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more the mabouls of this school than the students!
Let the parents get their kid out of there: she's in danger!
Completely in agreement.
Those who run this school are clearly completely ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most reprehensible state in the USA, but it is a part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These bright blue ribs that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a curled-up sweater.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but everything seems so annoying and soulless.
I don't feel like that's what he meant.
Contrarier, perhaps?
But what does it look like to be depressing?
You beat me.
I would have thought that a thin knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying ostracize, he meant alienation.
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
Worst of all, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, they could move forward that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
It looks like it was corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone really wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "hostrace," which absolutely meant nothing.
The U.S. unemployment rate is still falling by about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
America's economy, with Obama, is growing steadily.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
In order to live there at the moment, I would say that the United States is gradually getting closer to the explosion as inequalities become crazy there.
The political system is literally damaged by the state of the financing of election campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have a magnitude that we do not imagine in Europe, but Americans maintain incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
How long?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial community said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essentials.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and ticket board still can't give the change...
On the basis of the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "strangle" or rather bite.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing sympathetic voters from abroad makes it lose even more support from him?
I probably can't imagine.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their continuous cold war with Russia.
The shameful performance of Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mousse, playing 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was "designed to feed the right-wing nose into diversity"
The Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the safe by-election against the ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this return of crank, the pendulum has risen very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go back in the other direction.
Have you talked about your struggle against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safe seat at Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who isn't in denial knows it.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory at the Pyrrhus.
Search for the word "victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "defeat", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but she's thin.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent to who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know Canada's ice, Greenland and northern Russia were hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "pasteful" or malleable than we imagine.
Is that so?
A few small perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a " fairly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which gives/donates a) a whip to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "flash" or the facilitation of access to the area will be localized (more or less).
Difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for climate warming, it seems prudent to focus instead on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendlyly, patricadodusud, does this volcano have an effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate, future or past warming?
Isn't Prudence to stop warming up?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we don't see well.
Good morning, the end of the last glacial period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, particularly in the "active" Mountain Chains, where on the highly icy continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia.
Cordialement CB
Too often it is not known that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, delayed, according to its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This gives that the slip of tectonic plates, as well as tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bag, especially since the polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, thus causing a change in the balance of the land to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am glad of this "human", saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander sponsor, ridiculed himself by his stupid action on the environment that created him and which he so separated that he became harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that surpasses it in the organization of its very viscres, by an invention that consists in finding all possible means to dominate its next, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Long live the next game.
Beautiful Wild1 Story
Rather, it reminds me of a totally great series of 2002 that was called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost nobody remembers it now.
Too bad you're never past the first impression.
Your loss...
"The Jellies, our distant ancestors" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh here I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to be a dick-eyed man in front of a brain in a jar.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, obligated to watch Cox.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what it says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the show, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self-sufficient, in-soi, therefore non-conforming.
Certainly, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structure the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without making an inextricable horizon, there is no kinship with the Cartesian approach to examine what is received to believe, what is believed to be itself.
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid nombrill, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And it brings the most reductive and reactionary vision that sustains: behaviorism.
Gauchet has absolutely reason on this point and to be anticonformist, is to fight against this imbalance.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, we ask each other...
Black and soft, to others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followed by those who see each other in their mirror.
In any case, thank you to his controversial contestants to put under the spotlight of the current Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so educationally enlightening.
David Cameron supports the increase in the threshold of inheritance tax
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will increase its net value well once it's out of power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on the "serious policy" – it will be £100 once he has passed the weapon to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want a inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will most certainly pay the least of inheritance taxes thanks to super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
He'll be £100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to raise the threshold to $1 million, which is well below what you say is worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think that Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't choose him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only afford to accuse him of lying if he had actually been elected to power.
Just like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and the impending collapse will end him and the others of his acquittal.
His "rich" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000,000.
We must all be taxed to pay for essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I am not saying that discipline didactics are useless, of course, I just say that they are insufficient to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what?
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
She doesn't understand them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => she's reduced to creating a defiance relationship that makes everyone suffer in pure loss => there will be 1 skill training to teach.
A job that is learned, of course.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working with and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy doesn't go into equation even when you're a math teacher!
The "sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently lacking, precisely, is a true vocation at bcp of those who embrace the profession.
If gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer discipline didactics) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today is the students, of whom 1/3 tell us: learning is no use to anything I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this return.
Let us regret the old Standard Schools of Instructors..
She ends up at 3 in the morning starting this week, but she starts at midnight.
If it's found, it's all right with her time job anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It's not mine!
His show's been starting at midnight for years.
We have this thing called iplayer and that allows us to listen to programming on demand when we want it!
The Internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can't really listen to radio shows either.
I have a usb type adapter on the back of my SKY box, which is connected to the Internet, but listening to the radio on my TV seems to be too complicated for me.
Yeah, I think I cheated on the schedules, I had to hear Richard Lester about three hours from now.
Although it's men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its show is anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular animators, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show on the evening return of the job, is a woman
It's five shows.
So (of these five) is the most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows it very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-traced of the time.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but the lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to get sick of it or for her to get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It is normal for these people to vote FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alter power and make the country's clefs less fit than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a movie theater, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But because they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't derail, they don't interest politicians...
But of grace don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, doclocal, they are under men, the sociology is good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculture and ignorance as much as saying that it still has enormous growth potential, it really needs to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the FN thrives especially on poverty, the fear of everyday life, that of the other and the feeling of having no prospect.
But yes, you're right!
That pitiable humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
To take the electors for c...
That's what happens.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" actually there is less and less resource =>low endowments.
That's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just 'add and mix', women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are called into question, such as childcare and socio-productive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to play their socio-reproducer role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize gender roles.
The money speaks, and if a sex is not up to it, then the next!
Profits are mocking the life you're taking.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profits are mocking the heroism and the education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said, sister.
It is very problematic that no one speaks of unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) must be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows us to operate our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the Mskayadee point, how can we take into account the responsibilities assumed in a disproportionate manner by women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help a lot people who have to "check a box".
The tiger is not Russian but Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The right tiger to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply being exercised near the border, long-term exercises prior to the present situation.
Furthermore, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, here.
I got the same kind of idea right now.
This is an all-found pretext for arming some separatists to annex China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, it's that China is in Siberia.
It's only time to repair this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into a betly directed article against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
So this is not a leaf on the Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the suite of a Putin como operation.
When you expose yourself so much to the media, you also expose yourself to irony and even criticism.
The ritual of perpetual victimization of the Soviet-putinian sympathizer.
Hollande had also taken full pear with her camel without shouting at the plot against French.
Here our learner Alain Bougrain-Dubourg is the protector of the great Russia personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he got away...
Hollande gets fucked up, it's one thing.
At first glance, it seems to be a horribly condescending idea.
But, based on the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to say.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty to complain about paternalism.
After all, there is no disadvantage in brushing your teeth!
In fact - in fact - the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that's true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, from the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental subsidies offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue from the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better means to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a drawback to brushing his teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the layer of enamel.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can sting gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the book Guinness of records where someone had tried to brush their teeth for the longest time and the judges Guinness at the time strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
It seems to me to be a rotten experimental design.
Simply volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include things like double-blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming these texts are sent to every young person who perceives social benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they don't give back information about when they brush or brush their teeth (results easily fucked in the air by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any epigenetic consequences?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not on the genome, but on gene expression, and that these inherited traits could be passed on to the next generation.
Does the uterine transplant impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we don't want to be born of an impossible perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the reasonable limit.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not push for ever further, without the question of ethics, risk-taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, not it is not limitless and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the trance.
But leave the people, the women, the others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go up to risk taking and manage your little testicles to yourself, alone in your little pants to yourself.
of their "confer" this magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him sterilely in my safe if he can still give love?
The current narrow circumstances make PR FRYDMAN prudent on its communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What's going to put as an anti argument: cf here these men all male reactions curiously....
Marjane, all organ donation has nothing to do with anodin.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not entirely anodinous.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood both for the receiver and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow myself to judge in one sense or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women talking about it.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing anodin, and it reinforces the act of love that this implies.
Give a kidney to a family member who needs it doesn't have any anodin either, and it's done!
Please, no Messi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's really no more competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Deportivo has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thanks for fixing me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the goals records of Real Madrid this season to be able to then return to Old Trafford this summer with quiet consciousness...
I have a hard time believing that.
I believe Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was watching him on a crap connection so I can't tell you big deal if it's not that Valencia defended well and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the middle ground wouldn't get out of the way too fast, but they did well.
Parejo's overall game becomes better.
A terrible penalty laxly demanded but justly saved by Diego.
A Mestalla of a shrewd atmosphere and it shouldn't have been funny for Atletico's bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, appeared in the September 524 Archaeology magazine.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what you're guessing intuitively.
No wonder before making it complicated, we made it simple.
Every science progresses by small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved to him was?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a while ago that a black child mummy had been discovered in current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, including geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was prior to 1000 years in the first known African mummy).
Do you have any information about this?
Thanks in advance.
It's a bit awkward reading.
Perhaps these are not contaminations of modern times.
Was the desert at that time not far from now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing to where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough that a European scholar affirms it, even without any evidence, for it to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything in them.
But the song doesn't tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not always "of its lesser known devants".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal quacks in the free market that preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think that there are other people with Ebola and who the Spanish government is talking about, so as not to give itself a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they might remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those of Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of individuals.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good for nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say that yes, it is important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an aerial military base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the task of dismantling the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals mainly in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervened.
It's nothing but a right-wing swallower in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next election.
To be just to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he is far to his right and would find his place to the religious fools of the right in America.
Now he has to sing the praises of the hospitals he had before descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party right to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government has almost everything to do with it.
It's not as if someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called The comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting the work at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE patterns - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Pr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the ambient age.
A professor of law at the Collège de France seems not to be able to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel Prize in Economics and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, that's true when Dr. Villermé found the work of 8-year-olds 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were being shot in sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Ah, good old time...
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your lack of knowledge of TPE's boss profession!
Its job is not to know the right in all its meanders, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts inscribed on my youth salary newsletter, more than 100 info today!
Here is one example, one could cite much more, which illustrates the ongoing flow of constraints imposed without measure of consequences, and which stifle small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a client of the Sorbon.
As a result of the archi-resistance of the French Labour Code's thickness in relation to hevète, a serious academic would have plunged into Swiss texts and would have compared the number of official texts, then the number of comments (the absence of the latter could mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
Comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, refer to case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when an employee is fired, for example....
Who is it complicated??
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, case law, conventions, contracts) are in the area of Labour and Trade of unbearable obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has practically made itself immunized against criticism.
Is this guy still in a mood?
Surely it is time that new revolutionary absurdities force criticisms...
For each Ai Weiwei article I have recently read, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Go on to something else!
Go somewhere else, there is no lack of choice in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokesmen of the communist party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologize, but at all costs it had to be exposed (without making a bad joke).
It's the guy who blows up the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism trying to attract attention.
Real artists make a difference.
A good artist.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate the extremists of any board (including Zionists) must be put away
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and the City Hall of Neuilly.
He does not represent either.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, in marginal.
WHO SEES ASSEMBLY
What does the Neuilly Town Hall intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who agonizes a journalist and his family, and who calls on the public to attack this urbanist?
Crime appology?
Can't I find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This guy needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel plot and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
As many people believe to see in any political decision the hand of the "sionists" (a term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of their abuse), these two, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe to see in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fruitful the belly of the beast my good lady would think to have returned to Russia of the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's story are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of conspiracy on September 11th are of a gross stupidity.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the theory of the plot of September 11, we speak of cognitive dissonance regarding how to deal with the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally far-fetched truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the adept of this theory of detachment (as in the case of extreme religious).
There follows a logic and inescapable flight forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a conceit, but it does not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11th.
There are still a bunch of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/consorts do not appear to be in a hurry to answer.
There are indeed very far-fetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny anymore.
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized so that what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what requires (a little bit) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - are you going to drink a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health in danger by abstaining.
The government is putting an end to the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist advices based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first citation seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should consult (within one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them thoroughly, like the smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be grass!
My father wasn't drinking and he wasn't smoking, and cancer took him to 64.
So I'm going to continue drinking my two red bottles on Friday and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is being used Is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk today???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when one can run and reciprocally.
Completely in agreement.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
To both of them, they destroyed the F1 on the pretext of security.
Let's hope he pulls better than Schumi or even worse Wendlinger after his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but beware of item number 1: this is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that have refused to advance the departure so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly, +1
I just want to wish Jules Bianchi a quick and quick recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that have occurred between troubleshooting cranes and f1 were warnings free of charge.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had said it for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the FIA allow these manoeuvres without getting the safety out because?
I cannot accept that we invoke the risks of the profession or the fault of no chance when we have not prevented the foreseeable.
But that accident was.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which does not just mean "ban to go beyond the area" but has the first purpose of reporting a danger.
It's no shame, it's fortunately for the family to be in front of the TV.
Even under a yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more trappy in the lap and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, can even get at "low" speed compared to a normal rhythm.
But, well, we're in the void there, until we've seen the images, we can't issue an opinion.
I don't see much of what that changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
Hard to believe there are still jobs where we need to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people who are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals such as bears, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as enchantment and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains travel very, very often in one day.
In addition, as the roads often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated places, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city since this was a central element of the original construction of railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on it last night, really shocking.
You obviously haven't read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
Actually, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port town well before the railroad.
However, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Society of Canadian Railways should go to the next Dangerous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are trained extensively in the transportation of dangerous products.
This article, as many comments make the deadlock on the primordial religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforce this fact, if not what good to discuss about the sex of angels?
"God said: that's right - that's wrong" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim country but not of importance): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?" .
In other words: obey the priest as pastor rabbi imam and do your prayers, it will be better!

May His appendix Nouilles touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in some way trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: the one of the strong Euro ( rather paloting at the moment ) or the one of the free market ( rightly supported by the state when it needs to flourish ) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious upheavals.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the trailer and is expressed in schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even though it also bore forms of contestation.
The theology broken between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knows no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of the "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appeal to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and, fortunately, they are the most numerous) who "read the texts wrongly" and retain only what belongs to humanism and the values common to all humanity, atheists and believers diverse.
For me, fanaticism is the foolish and wicked application of passages from the sacred texts that come out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "mécréants", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if we do not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a situation of self-defense.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", this is a religious requirement that today makes almost unanimity in the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to get out of this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Are you not guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the clip?
Band of Neanderthals overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've hurt humanity enough!
What did they frankly bring to us apart to have outraged us with the neighbors, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasman Devil and this satanite Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films like The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe was a New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.
Sox does not need any help under this heading.
How I managed to guess that it would be a "little white"!

Most of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to go until explicitly designate the separatists is in the otanesque line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European gentile neo-Nazis bravely facing the wicked Russians
@SavantCosinus: Switch to browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your speech the wicked are the ss Ukrainians and the Gentiles the Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This ticket is not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistants are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
To Alexandre Kastals: where do you get these details about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (unfortunately she loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (likely to say anything)?
ALLEEEEEEZ THE ROUMANIE!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not stopped denigrating Romanian football until the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperativa", which decided before the beginning of the season what team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would launder money at his will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill-advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his errors to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without a sentence), and therefore took three and a half years of imprisonment.
The trial was also valid from the prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the manager of steaua Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali is also serving a penalty for trying to bribe (and subsequently concealed the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, in order to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to bribe were our neighbors in Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I always enjoy this moment so much.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among others, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that implied that the money that the police confiscated from Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor, uneducated, idiotic, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist cretins today.
You might think that after the last time they broke chairs from the stadium and shop windows, and where they branded racist banners in the streets they would not have been able to have tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take over Al-Ittihad's reindeer.
Wherever he's done, it'll be a disappointment after Stockport County turned him down.
Super article.
If it was Sarkozy who did this, we would have heard the left scream like a big sick man.
But since it's kind Hollande, a friend of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but pretty low
That is why economic circles sometimes prefer a left-wing party to settle in power.
They are the bankers who finance Obama's victory, and they don't have enough of their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of jobseekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should employment increase the control of the unemployed by the beginning of 2015?
I hope that in the run, the pole fisc, will also generalize the absolute control of the governors called commonly plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasions, robber patterns, and other malandrins.
Can you do a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time.
It's true that when we have the class: we treat the population of literate and toothless.
Every new period of unemployment is dozens and dozens of applications I address to employers who most often don't even get a reception charge, it has been automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" patronage of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article of the chained duck?
It is learned that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It is learned that controls have allowed the removal of people who for more than half of them no longer receive unemployment benefits.
So we're wondering how we can control people we never see.
One wonders what the penalty is for disposing of someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if one can admit that this reform is going to allow for more removal, one wonders what it's going to do to help recruits.
"It is learned that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question needs to be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we chase them out of the EU?
The EU was only economic in nature and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "police of thoughts".
The EU is a pacifist project.
It does not make any sense on an economic level.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality ??
Eastern European teams are constantly being led by the corrupt Mafia referees of UEFA.
The best solution would be for the entire East to leave this lucrative organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality ?
So what the hell is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
Uefa should applaud them for playing Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been going on all over the world for a few years, and I don't overdo it.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would it be that he hoped to be twisting small symmetrical phrases, just story of maintaining controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there has been, there is and there will be people who are willing to throw oil on fire.
Decoding would be to say that Western states are against a "Palestinian state", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli state.
Decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action should be taken against the overarmed Israeli State occupying the besieged destroyer oppressor colonizer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was for nothing in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavarian of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to demand and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr. Let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to question history, its allies and its supporters to reveal truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule has been colonized by the Romans but there is currently no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is much discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state defines itself as that of a "Jewish people" whose no non-Jewish can be a part of.
The Israeli state discriminates against the non-Jewish, hence the contentious.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break with the Zionism that opposes Jews and not Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by this saving civilization as their first status!
Two realities we must stop ignoring.
First, the Zionist European project (colonizing Palestine) involved dispossessing the Palestinians, so it was an inherently anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay lacked biting from the start.
Their tender result will give them what bites their fingers.
It should begin with rehab by small mouths.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
So many subtleties are tolerated, including racial insults and physically hard spots in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I would like to see him return to England, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molars.
Football is a contact sport where the heels exist and yes, therefore players will get hurt.
Returning his teeth to the flesh of an opponent to have the advantage certainly does not have its place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for having made a similar move.
This is now the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would the consequences be in your opinion?
I knew someone was gonna bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this sarcasm with two bullets.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back to play with his teeth.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost bite the hammock.
A prerequisite for a good school course is respect by students of their teachers and of the school institution.
This works if parents inculcate this respect for their children.
Parents more easily transmit this respect if they also feel respected by the teachers and their children's school.
In good institutions, those who advance their upbringing, parents are considered partners, not emm..
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (to teach, educate, learn respect, limits, live together in short) It is up to parents to do at least 50% of the taf.
But it's probably easier to take it to school.
Paying on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school could have a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be necessary for actors (professes, hierarchies and ministry) to play their part and not to be permanently involved.
We can dissolve a troupe that takes off to revive it, not families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's first role.
Transmit knowledge.
And if there's a parent requirement, the school provides education for their children.
What is the minister who will dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beautiful suburbs of the East?
It's a beautiful one, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Slappy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him down and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squared true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
Indeed a beautiful north coast !!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would of course come to the conclusion that they are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
It goes for a grunt, today. :(
Yeah, but his leader keeps him hungry on a regular basis.
You would also be rather sturdy if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illegal life benefits will forever be beyond your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then abandoned it.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand state aid.
And as she knows how to do lobbying, no fears about the outcome.
And so much for employment in France that it has nothing to do, it comes from legumes always ready to break when their corporation has losses in the markets, especially outside...
It is precisely because their lobbying did not work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the marpol deadline or arrangement, no doubt that the project would have succeeded.
Hurry up, to see if it's right or not and how BF is going to comply with the law anyway, it would be nice if "the world" looks at it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by the Breton legumes.
Those who burn the tax and secu centres.
They want state aid.
That they don't seem normal to me at least.
Well to the extent that armed a French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it is normal to wait for a boost from the state.
Or we condemn ourselves to allow the British to monopolize the market.
It's a choice.
Everlasting French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investments, and a very short amount of envy.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
That's it, and then they'll create the Breton pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain Bretons.
With this, they're sure they're going to lower the costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to Genesis's spirit of the 1970s than other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "detesting everything related to the prog," as they just released an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career that would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s," I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he has had various degrees of participation and pretend to have a affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to gather a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I don't think Steve Hackett is asking for anything more than a fair performance, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, the first solo album by Bank, is absolutely great, and quite in the spirit Genesis of the 1970s.
They went past Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have such an interesting story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good point.
I would still say that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it DOORAIT progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest cries out "prejudice": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a striking success.
There will always be a big difference between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his flawed understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him have done so since the most just and wisest vision and reflection in a society.
That is, they have no excuses.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is exactly where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
It is necessary to have a very controversial mind of the common mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal's been doing since his flawed understanding of things.
But this is also what causes pain, hatred, and vindictiveness among the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that can never be used by those who decide wisely the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestrians.
But, in an attempt to balance the analysis, one might also argue that the sentenced to death, often, has exercised a wild violence, which he has enjoyed, against people who are quite kind, who have done the costs free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain mitigated with the disappearance of the one who was the boar, sometimes the torturer, of being loved and haunting their nights.
Don't despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he showed great intelligence.
The one with the heart.
That's probably what I've been reading more just for a long time.
However, one would think to read stories from another era, old things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that blaze, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same is true for the two other "U.S. Excellent Romans" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overtaken.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's that rhyme about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this painful Bellow, who received the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we are to have an American winner, we might as well have a racist [light].
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce "genie novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph on the other hand...
Which ones did you read?
How many books of DeLillo did the anti-DeLillo read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News as "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The earliest novels, the crazier, the smaller, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna end up Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writing talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be conflict???
It's of simple interest.
It was a sense of humor, "the law," not a definition request.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady has acted in her sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" is doing there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she gets very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not warn him of danger.
After we hear that the French employees are not dynamic and seek only tranquility.
The floodplains that become constructible from day to day when a major construction program is going to start there, it is classic, and not only on a low coast.
Look at the flood plains near the rivers.
We were told that "these days there are no more floods due to regulatory dams."
Now you have to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is there a clearer interest?
Get out the calculator and you'll dream of the life you might have been in place of Ms Babin, First Deputy UMP of La Falle sur Mer and former president of the Planning Commission, which grants building permits!
The two mothers of the Sarkozysme triumphant are the old and the real estate.
I am from the left and not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but please, not from low politics or from low all azimuths, we are not in there in a battle of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are tough criminals.
The US is a shit hole.
So what shit hole do you live in?
The U.S. isn't a shit hole.
Yeah, U.S. cops are tough because of the races they're dealing with every day.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops "come to fuck them because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that there is an incident like this to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals deep ignorance of the US...
You're the ignorant one here.
Good cops have to report corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant, but in fact it is clearly you who do not think anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (this is not ossive speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension is going on in this matter at the moment.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in different ways, hence the treatment of Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me with the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to question those responsible, make them talk, arouse confidence.
Man going to the Elysee has nothing to do with it.
Then, what counts is overlap, verification, analysis.
And here we understand that sarkolatras are worried about getting done.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-sarkozysm based on cases mounted from all parts (a non-place and no conviction) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates(2 referrals in corrections), two friendly journalists from Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Hollande...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not teleguided!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's supporters are outraged!
From the extract that I was able to read, VA's article only causes the roast to spray.
I even laughed so hard it was rude.
For the rest, the world's complaint is unlikely to come about because journalists are not "intended" to the secret of sources, is it not?
Unlike that there seems to be no connection between VA and the power, while there seems to be a connection between the power and the journalists of the world for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the world about the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are well in front of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
Hence this editorial to the abois, which says a lot about the complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I would have thought the bird would go well with smoked herring! <*))))))<<<
It is simply for the figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about the issue of immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration broadcast was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people who entered and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperative, refusing even to give soup waffles simply because of the religion of the lady, he also refused to enter her place of worship even though she told her that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a public director :) So much the better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were on the left, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour has done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to fit the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-east allowed, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left-wing and non-communist centre, I said this to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Drop your arguments prepared as much as you want, but what I've asked of you is specific examples of Gauchist policy, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour had done that was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and you changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another disctature, that of money.
We'll make some pretty savings by turning these technocrats...
The treaties should be renegotiated, I'll be told.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still makes sense in Europe, should that not do so?
Curiously, the Commission does not look at unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be negligible.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector completely market.
A term, this means that whole parts of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
All sacrifice, including the advance of a country, in the name of the Liberal doxa did not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that one day will have to deal with well.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the SNCF's accounts.
The French state has resigned for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but they do not have the means to compel them to comply with their commitments.
But using public money without waste, it is essential today where public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I do not see very well what competition from TER could consist of!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If so, surely he shouldn't be head of the Louveteaus?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, still coming out of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having a former alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
However, it would seem sensible to begin the process of separation between your life and the complications that you inherited.
Looks like they're doing it, but it seems hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones surface, have you thought about a "flight" plan so that you can cut off your life and your future?
Financial problems have an adverse effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and some pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
It looks vindicative and persistent.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to provide support to help them get back to work and pay for maintenance?
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more things than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try for them to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their sake, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuous father/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I believe that children end up understanding who is wrong, if they are allowed to see things by themselves.
Going a little further, you're close to the Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years the civilization will have disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does the least saying social, fiscal, but also environmental has a competitive advantage immediately, and others are forced to follow.
All policies seek is growth, Growth.
There should be international coordination, but by then...
It is not the climatosceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who warms up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in the houses that it was necessary to build, those who buy industrial products that it had to produce and transport.
It is not the climatosceptics that have manifested against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climatosceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that the climateosceptics emit more CO2 than the others.
Environmental defenders also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
Political action is also needed (other sources of energy, reducing car dependency, etc.).
And politicians act in part on the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But it may be funny to say that the expression is Terminator.
"Greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but every good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it's about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long before someone fails immigration?
I blame the crap that took all the money.

Don't use the word immigration, you'll be afraid of horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our retirements, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic basins, to bury the 30,000 people who die every year of hypothermia or hunger (don't forget your wool and your bonnet, which allow you to warm up, to turn off the heating and eat this sandwich in the cheese).
Don't be so stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a joke or is it not made express?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend good time in space making grunts and snoring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The TV reality has therefore not invented anything, and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and to delight the media coverage of the western kingdoms used to the maternity tabloids.
They might have to go down to the ground and see that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to think, we don't send men or women into space to make crackers or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for humanity in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives are the result of space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
May you quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a bit of money.
The ball pen that works the tip in the air (for example to write at the ceiling)
To pay for his trades?
To participate in the manufacture of an unnecessary product?
Or propose how to make more money for investors?
In short, working to work does not mean anything and represents the voidness itself.
Ah, if the last one played high tech.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to take the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking about buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think they're buying plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy plastic guns in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
No because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mislead people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor rather than putting a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) that was on it meant?
Bad typical reportage, we are late on the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The family of Dirani, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to overthrow the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the little blankets you give in the quick dumps can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculous that the author gives it.
Don't bother trying to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword," the facts as you put it actually support its argument.
On occasion I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes all the sense now...
I saw that guy who seemed to be from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful innovations, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a necessity to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a cost (subscription, electric consumption) that weighs in budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, call on the Solidarity Energy Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the charms of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been so isolated this year!
Interesting about that PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, testing water-saving showers and advocating the installation of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) is 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a crisis of demand, it is a crisis of the system that can no longer produce enough surplus (which would then have redistributed in the form of an increase in revenue in real terms) so that these surplus pay the increase in expenditure that you place in the category "constricted expenditures".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element likely to constrain, increasingly decades after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes it possible to achieve any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, is transforming, energy is making it possible to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure to increase energy efficiency (i.e. "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, forces production to rise (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not cost-effective if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and the fact that it is possible, or not, to increase the "production" of energy that is not expensive.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only be worsened in the coming years and decades (the IEA, in the latter reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 there was a peak of conventional oil production, understanding, of cheap oil.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very strong density of energy, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job no matter what the performance is.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it equals things.
Take this to France!
Vote No. 18.
You're a Guardian's webmaster?
As previously noted: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
It's a good job for the guys.
Although many English people like to mock Scottish people when they just lose, there is no telling, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even funnier if you play against them ;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because now that the "gold Shige generation" withdraws, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the 1 1 th, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, was really "international-class" is David Beckham, a little effeminate, perhaps, but I think that if he took a overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, speaking of athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never mock Scottish people.
I tend to be surprised to observe their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class" is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is on that Juppe would have trouble asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean people come in here to laugh a little bit?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his deputies' compensations...
I ask myself, above all, what he can tell us in his lectures.
How can we reduce its deficit?
How to return to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, regardless of his scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people are really working and that the results presented in their - free - conferences are real.
At the time of the limitations on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is uplifting.
The conferences of researchers are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
Everything is getting brighter for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of UMP ethics
I feel like he's being blamed for making money??
I'm far from being one of his fans, but let's blame him for having hurt (or fraudulently) manage his campaign OK.
But doing conferences seems to me to be a very legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Rule #1 of epidemiology: Isolating.
All United States and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended a few weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than the politically correct one.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential locations.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take back a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I can see that they are banned from all flights and ships towards the United Kingdom.
We would always need to send goods that said...
What a shame that the panic of the international media about Ebola is no longer being used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It’s such a sad journalistic article, such a small headline.
I could read every paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (all too relevant): Women are the first donors of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all help to better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches, and the gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it and write, let's not just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you can't offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as beheading - an equally barbaric form of terrorism, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validation" in his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I thought that the Guardian was "growing" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning his founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, let that appear?
For a territorial elector or other the money does not count.
I constantly read that the Territorial Public Service is increasing its workforce, and I have never seen any articles giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will probably be lies and truths, to separate us from the good grain of ivory.
The court of accounts costs so much to tell so many economic nieries.
It's true they never had anything to do with the people on Cambon Street.
TBs are not deficits they have funding needs that can only relate to and only to the investments they make.
It forces to use concepts too loose the press as the World makes the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, the collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt finance mainly operating costs...
And as the overemployment of public servants (for example, to make beautiful round-points) leads to a growing and incompressible burden (compulsory load up to their deaths, since work and retirement), these communities are cutting back on investment.
The status of civil servants should therefore be abolished, prior to the decrease in staffing.
And also to hold the mayors financially accountable.
It is fabulous that the intercommunals should be accompanied by a decrease in the number of municipal staff and it is the opposite that occurs, evidence that adding one level is not effective without the abolition of others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is over, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse engulfed, in the administrative canvas, it would look like it!
Let's try even garroted, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the Fifth led with its providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then he continued to lead to the "end of breath" series coming up loudly about.
Why are they not going to live in an apartment at $250 million in Monaco over a movie theater to leave all that suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try answers like "it's the fault of the whites."
"response" not "response"
I sincerely hope it is sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
We now agree that modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly humid period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to be on the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resignation!
in 2017:Transformation into a comfortable private hotel of golden wardrobes for future retired people of the Republic?
Moving upstairs dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a medicine at 3 speeds.
We'll save money and the military will take care of the flu from the last one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all walks of life?
London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They abandoned London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, huh?
It changes that a football team uses a rugby club pitch instead of the other way around.
In addition, outside travel for the Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the misfortune to be bought by the Sale Sharks, and we finally rented our own stadium to them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did not favour us.
I love to support Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of supporters and until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stadium resumed by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the CCF's recent problems, but this must be a good one.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest I don't know anyone who does it except some Wasps fans at work.
Are there thousands of other people in the South East going to follow them from a distance or are they going to have to support another team now?
Beautiful article pro-domo and good vulgarization.
Who cares?
But then, why ALL IT systems are not based on these concepts ???
+because a huge mass of programs preexist (cobol, java), +because all systems do not require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is being the first on the segment.
The work of G.

But they don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few of them know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has decreased.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to salt in the future.
It looks like they're thinking about making more profits, and not making healthier dishes and the best value for money.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, watch out that people don't have too much grease.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
A little sodium glutamate could also be added.
The amount of salt you have to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly improves the taste of the finished product.
This is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way they cook the pasta.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Are there family restaurants and do they offer tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal accident at work that went wrong.
A promising young man, an apprentice thief, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man has beaten everything and brutally interrupted this vocation.
To have him sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment appears to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
I totally agree!
What a humor!
The desire to cut it is evident and difficult to excuse and blameful at all times...
Indeed, the desire for it is hardly excusable.
That's what makes me have some sympathy for a 15-year-old kid.
During the trial the boy's father complained of never seeing his son again, but without asking forgiveness to the loved ones of the guy he himself killed.
Who really is a victim of this story?
What do you come to mix it all!!!?
The boy's father was convicted of what he did.
With regard to the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, he knew exactly how dangerous the bullets were.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he's responsible for!
10 years, that's a little bit much in my opinion.
For having had the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
Yeah, that sounded like it!
If the occasion occurs, go on vacation in the Mosulle Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
I've done it twice, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
Excuse me, the Moselle Valley, I've hit too fast.
It is a pleasure to see that German wine is recognized.
It is rather important to note that German winemakers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not that the Moselle region to be recommended - Franconie, the Rhine Palatine (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or maybe it's the other way around, in short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of whites during meals, they now offer a lot more, and with a much higher alcohol content than their 9 favorite degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle to the property are so complex, the softness is superbly balanced.
Try the Schloss Vollrad spatle with a thermometer lobster next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a superbly illustrated guide.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new Baden droughts that will now accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (heh, I don't really think it's always true or evocative, except if I address myself at over 40 - who, as I say, have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Graze would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which it is the Administration of France.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be put to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these barbychette-held departments, and decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbograin is right.
It should be done as in Green Sun: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
In fact, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor poor assets (sics) since they can no longer go to market.
In reality, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you will no longer have deficit problems!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, which are currently disappearing, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So of geriatrics, certainly, but to think otherwise of a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, maximum growth to 1.5% (which has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the entire model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that we know more in public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really screwed.
We're screwed first because the rest of the hospitals don't fit.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are treated elsewhere than at the public hospital.
The solution is more in increasing the supply of public service in hospitals than in maintaining two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of medical excellence in France, and of course a symbol.
Closing would be a fault, a sign of more walking towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"Hospitalization Day Award", a hospital management unit, is decided by the local-supervised department of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better job paid than the one he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-Citizen parents is almost always non-Citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents of citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to have two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecutions and ill-treatment and war that make the people of their country flee and force them to come and seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during the civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returns to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little trick when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the abuse that still took place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of the Tamils having links with the LTTE, thinking that they would run a risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum application assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that persons connected with the LTTE be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too can, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've been gone to the coconut for so long.
In fact, this guy couldn't get a chance to make it.
Didn't there an health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know what is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is still little, we were told that the Ebola kills so quickly that a large epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of returned people was nil.
The weirder we get, the more I'm afraid.
You should read funny newspapers to believe that a risk may be null.
Low or low, but not low.
Finally, this is a scientific reality, the more a virus is fatal quickly (in general) the less it is likely to spread because the death of the host signifies its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) occurs sometimes ex the Spanish flu.
After that is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
Is there not something obscene about making some brave and virtuous Western media advance, but at the expense of thousands of other African sick people whose profession, bravery, and virtues are unknown?
Of course, this highlights the work of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but the repetition of announcements is a terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so loved by the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers in arms attacking Australian freedom of expression and the right to privacy.
I bet they never imagined that their conservatives would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one that won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warm-up for when the problem really gets out of control.
There aren't enough doctors already working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Health Research Future Markets Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be a black emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that the Australian voters can see this excellent Russian for what she is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Long Term Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low-income people.
It may be very clever, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "minister rodent" and his Long Term Markets Fund from Telstra were excellent tutors to him.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him in hell to the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I have also noted it, quite corrosive as noted.
If only he could deter her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst fate for a politician at the end of his career: not to be recognized on the street.
Good morning She was not recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently up to the point to administer it.
How good the "provincial" sense is!
We live in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I am against the port of burqa, but that is not the question.
What this anecdote tells is sarkosism in the pure state: of tiny ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each pass of the road to show that he is well guarded of the public order), rudeness and unresponsiveness brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" who have become unmanned to carry a gun and a badge should have been given the right to exercise their self-proclaimed function as vigilantes.
But who is Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson of the case: even the police turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they don't even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I want this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
Just like bob, just for the time being
I don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well...!
Nadine, if she doesn't exist, she should be invented!
It's easy, though, and it looks like Christine Boutin with a blond wig.
On this one, N.
Morano manifestly done in contempt in fact, in the contempt of the police officer that she had in front of her, and who would probably have had to multiply the curves and "Yes, Madam, of course, right away, Madam, tell me in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Horns abandoned an aerial attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at that, but I still think Isis is going to overtake them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone counted the dead bodies now here nobody does.
For civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing competes with the Western war machine.
I do not agree with the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (which includes non-Western ones) between the two wars in Iraq, would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, older persons and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred the sanctions to the derailment of the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred the sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good point - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsiderate in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may recall that the insurgents did not waste time to mark their main enemy when they saw it, in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission headquarters that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and on two occasions and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
As brutal and hard as he was, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a United Nations mission had been targeted like this.
Good point, I had actually forgotten that.
So, add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent unrest in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly at people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument but to exaggerate statistics that are notoriously unreliable.
The only vaguely reliable figures on deaths related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to ascertain the facts.
It was of course in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths in children under five was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctioned deaths is largely biased towards this age group.
Of course, it must be feared, but also the gift of gametes in general.
It is necessary to stop doing as if people were pure minds, that love was all that children needed, and that they could be done with strangers that neither parent nor child will ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fantastical arguments, we should be able to explain what serious problems may arise for an adopted child or designed with a gift of gametes.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes that you came out of, you might, in my opinion, hand them over, because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest progress made by WFP (e.g. uterine strike) is at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire of children justifies these acrobats and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just the point.
It's obvious that we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad if we can't have a child when we want to.
It's a problem I met with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming disabled, getting a serious illness, losing all her children in an accident, etc.
Of all the worries of life it is not the most serious.
It is a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer bears any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumed, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a whim where one could use the other according to one's good will.
Sterility demands reflection and acceptance.
