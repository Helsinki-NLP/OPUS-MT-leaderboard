Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the removal of the minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was disadvantaged for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final, the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 members in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The victory of Libya
The story of Libyan liberation, or of Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be defined who is the winner
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the election, but now it is a question of diluciding whether it is moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates wait for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of warrior tribes, will unite with the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably not suitable for the Libyans mentioned above.
The truth is that it is not surprising that the Islamic combatants would be grateful for the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantee of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for locals to expel the "crosses"
But without occupation will the oil tankers be made with the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go to the finder of investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquarcial period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer pay attention to Italy alone, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (a 0.3% increase rather than expected 0.1%), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1% was given (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the four-month period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSU the trend towards gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is consistent.
The results are even worse than analyst forecasts.
Main events:
Interannually, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% on an annual basis.
The interest of their 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bond at ten years remain at 4%, although in the area the situation is getting worse.
In Germany, voices are raised that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team meets the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, won by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second time, fought fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so that the European championship will not be missed.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough story.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game by Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let go of two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the meeting of the Cup of Europe, so the national football bows will get a gratification of about 200 million kroner.
It's been a good offensive game for the first few minutes now.
Both teams were just trying to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks in the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense managed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
By their gesture they would like to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon to the facilities and then chore death slogans for the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students trained on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center in which uranium is worked.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, strives to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan power station, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5 per cent.
Obese children come in most families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current research.
It shows again the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, of sausages at least twice as often as children of normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a chance."
In overweight families there is no practice of sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last year's school year and participated in it almost 900 children of Basic Education from all Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the "Obesity of not a chance" program, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A proper diet and a sufficient amount of family exercise are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
The specialists warn that, in healthy development, the details are also important, which they also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren's families had breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that 10% of households didn't have breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in obese children's families there is much more frequent use of fries.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet refreshments daily (70%).
As a rule, they do sport over 40 per cent of the children surveyed, but among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far removed from the ideal."
Among their favourite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweets," is warned in the final report of the study.
As a main meal, you take the palm to the pasta and follow the meat closely.
Practically, children always reject legumes and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switch to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who completed the questionnaire after the completion of the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence," an important change was made in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy eating," is pointed out in the study's results.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and common water.
Children would also more often choose bird meat and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, they support professionals
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final reviews, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it no longer fits a pin.
We have now studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And that's the big majority.
Someone is a cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without proper curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist should be able to optically soften wide shoulders, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the Jennifer López type, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time do not dress it too challengingly
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth stitching at least one piece of fabric extra to measure.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothes they feel perfectly unpayable.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with a one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've been touched by "dressing" Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, it's much better for me than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened about a hundred kilos (please consider the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them out of the magazines or search them online and print them, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also deals with, for example, the pages of products in the magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, pockets, shelters, etc.).
All this the designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But all of this is for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest experts animated the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
Designer Hanza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to get away with it.
And a good designer knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in classic with cowboys and t-shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Either you just toss it up and up your neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you must first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's without talking about the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a designer has to have more types of clothes on the reservation than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the pictures the clothes work in combination with other clothes, they all differ from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style they suppose alone, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I have enough skills, my physical aspect is not so important).
And when someone asks for our services, you have to bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size that is very different from their actual (lessor) size.
Then it's just guglaring to find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, whether a certain celebrity has fattened/depreciated, etc.
On Sunday, Hanza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand outfits.
During your work, you must above all communicate with the people you've seen, so it's essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss it, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify him and complete him with beautiful clothes, you can't catch and throw away everything there was and say, "What a horror!".
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on," says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects like scissors, such as scissors, caps, or imperdibles. There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the session of photos of products such as bags or hats), special straps of bandages in front, if it is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to remain in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to put on the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, one could damage the sole and much more the exterior.
And we just put on and on.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So it had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me joy in praising my unreserved work.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of all that we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that it's not a pink road to professional style, but it gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, initially careless, is complicated because of a series of improper carelessness of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent it was achieved to meet expectations, but this is of no use if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, aroused great expectations already before its debut.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old race saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what he showed, he appears as a game that shouldn't end up being a kind of action again without more.
We were also curious to know how the scenes would stay, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much with what we expected.
There are races that can be done for acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
It is not really possible to name mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible misdemeanour of the programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each career takes place through a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant in view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries in the series.
So it's nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high mountains covered in snow produces a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, careers are sometimes diversified by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance to a required number of rivals (the normal in a classic race), then you try to earn time (the classic timed duel) and then you expect a duel against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this sometimes the police appear, which only makes it difficult even more.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than one could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be claimed to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better between the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same no longer occurs with collisions.
Of such games you can't expect it to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or moving the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing out-of-control pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last point of rescue on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, neither the reset helps, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one has to enter a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or five minutes before or after.
This makes anger especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you get there, you have to turn or stop.
It's the same when you get there, because it's programmed that the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nostrils.
Adversaries also have one more advantage.
During the whole game you will reach places where, regardless of the time, you will always advance the same adversary in the same site.
Moreover, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes before you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come from the front, so at first you can make papillate the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it's a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and actionable, so it's often not possible to follow the details of what's going on or where.
And it really does the same, if merit is carried the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or classification in the race so that it does not break boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to be careful with the gas pumps next to the road, because right there you have to switch cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, the American strong cars for straight highways and the exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
Also the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know through the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (pass), where you run in darkness through the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (step) and, suddenly, the subway convoy arrives behind you and takes you forward without further.
In the wording we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none even thought a bit or whether the authors actually take us for a bunch of bobos.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even proud.
For it is a pity that at the most tense times image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to enjoy most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoids absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is assured, but prepare because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.
The choirs of the University Carolina will participate in the concert "Students of Terciopelo".

Ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nova:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war to take place without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation is a bit stable, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," so convincedly began their conference at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take his slogan "clearly and openly about Europe", which he already said in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the U. Carolina Faculty of Law.
Vice-Nová also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first comes criticism, which if it is unsatisfied, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I must say that it has left everyone bewildered, because it assumes its roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to members of the twenty-seven states, to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?". It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our Olomouc cheese.
Vice-Nová has also taken care of the agenda following, following and following the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU now has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good upheaval", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, must be approved much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which ones will be less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, alienisms, or jargons that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that the cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, curvature or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe is waiting for us at speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and I am approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman next to me tells me, "What, have you already stayed, the Visegrad Group?", and it can be seen that it doesn't do him any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is looking forward to new very tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if they are no longer, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, that stay out of it," he said.
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen the two-speed Europe", Vice-Nova is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy with great precision, the closest would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term nature was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his mark, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century," said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano during his birthday.
A Sophisticated System
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as Bağa's employer in Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were of the first U.S. workers who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in its relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (as one of the world's first companies to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, which will replace him next year: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working for thirty years in IBM, where she's been a sales leader, marquetin and strategies.
During the last few years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, rain of online ideas, from which emerge infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is no surprise that there are more than half a million people working in the firm.
A well-reputed institution
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last 100 years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents from all US technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among their inventions are ATMs, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year it has become the second technological firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not put up for its own operating system, OS/2, services online Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
Therefore, IBM has no problems building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And this difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In the matter of sales, IBM is primarily engaged in services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the supplier's share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in future technology purchase.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased the investments.
It seems that until now IBM has been able to take over the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from the cheese cutter to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation that led to IBM's birth arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions like the famous "Fitting Clock", which allows control of the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory advice.
Flint asked the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM's founder ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all types of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the big expansion of the company across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous moon flight).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classics "fish", which set up the computer standard of that time, reached the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consultancy part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its objective is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have improved, for example, with regard to the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at that time, the first country that had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic centre for outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about his unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartosová (45), but also her lover, Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové in her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after İíčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even dismissed him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife lies with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him away."
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old Borrico who was wronged, but as a man to whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said and added that he had already disengaged himself from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't care until now that his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases."
"Darina and I spoke to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," says Josef.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where are certain feminine vices that can make men boil their blood?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who's dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapito a week?
Do you like to buy often at the downhills?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to stroll around the clothing stores, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although it is a hobby for most women to go shopping, for men it can become almost hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you'd better wait in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"You'd need to take at least five kilos-- should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What do you mean, "yes"?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of complaints, the more annoying women become.
Ordering and Cleaning First
It's like an infinite whirlwind.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the powder, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Does he blame his partner for standing the floor clean with a dirty foot, his children for messing up a fresh washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "detour", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness certainly should not occupy being paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Used underwear are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If he makes these comets to his partner more times a day, know that he'll get it out of his boxes.
Of course. You don’t mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Kales and chismes
Some women also have slanders, gossips, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, who, how, and why.
Maybe each one of us sometimes gets away with a small, harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do it, despise everyone and prove dangerous to those around them, especially in a female labor team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The hockey front Jaromír Jágr took part on Monday in the NHL meeting with two attendees who brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put the Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the 39-year-old star, and took one more step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assists were given to the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Already before the match I told him I'd make triplets."
"I presented it."
"Sometimes they look ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first Flyers track.
A while later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trail.
Voráček made himself with the record behind the portery of the Hurricanes and moved him between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
In particular by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he took the third goal, after his shot hung up in the room of Wayne Simmonds' doormanship.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the field, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr pondered at his headquarters.
"It never occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, from penaltyti, to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to reach the record and I'm happy that I got it," Voráček described the final goal of the match as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech advocate for Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third retired for an injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with much experience in defense, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were new."
"Well, but nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave holes," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The goals of Jets were marked by five players who ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time sold in most cases only to the socialist bloc, because the trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went from holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime bowed west and the Czech tourists' trips were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue with a sleeping bag and spend it all night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "change promise" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a change guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their vacations in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs would acquire. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs travel has suffered from a genuine revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which today we are no longer aware, that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not be travelled freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemptions were imposed for travel to the neighbouring States of Western Europe, resulting in an enormous wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see a lot of trips to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups were sleeping in the parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was to take the food with them (conservations, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it average wages, which around 1997 resulted in an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare trips using charter flight connections, which made the prices of travel incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90s of the last century, the Czechs were already travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism was already in 2000, when the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and it went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights depart every year with Czech tourists made distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, so our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, spent more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including expenses at the place of stay.
Convoked Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up in a dead end again.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly will be convened this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without the same, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Czech football is chaired by Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June not without summoning his colleagues to find a strong person who would be able to deal with football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era was concluded, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Praguenese neighborhood of Smichov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.
There was no consensus or consensus on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer give rise to the Executive Committee which, at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead end?
"The dispute revolves around whether one should proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the proposed model in the statutes, in the third round, he will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Moravia Region is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would take away, however, the meaning of the two previous rounds and would completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," so it is as Svoboda understands the objections of the party he lived, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Tomaš Paclík also agrees, surprisingly, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is supposed to be more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like to have the highest number of votes in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who is first applied as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will calm down with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"Futball will be the main player again, and so it will cooperate more willingly," says the Representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in the management of football, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope that common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be held at the ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to join the divided parties in the country's most powerful sports organization for an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give Czech sport a new direction after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the Chief of Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not present himself as a candidate for such a significant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I'd be fighting for her and I wouldn't be running for election."
"But to this day you haven't been able to find such a person," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, who paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he succeeds, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that view," he adds.
What is allegedly most annoying to Paclík right now is the relationship of Pelta with the president of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case you win, the current status will be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name Pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "sold the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, it is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine that, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I don't put my noses where I don't feel capable either," added Paclík, who in September gave much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitrators Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It makes use of its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it has also been the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, who probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems that the new President should address."
"If the gambling taxes are increased, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is also associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in giving up hypocritically my Pilsen Club shares to another person and then return there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of election, he would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve future electoral disputes.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and hopes to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He was convinced that behind the current problems with the elections was the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the statutes were passed in the June General Assembly that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Precisely the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win delegates.
"If you choose me president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," Pelta says.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past he had already warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respects his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It took a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head.
"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt about their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower to higher competitions.
The latter should be your football promotion showcase.
"As well as that, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all the football," he said two months ago to the 46-year-old ČTK.
He also promised that his appointment as football president would not entail any personal changes to the staffing structure.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios facing the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Futhball needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," two days before the most decisive day in its career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under her leadership, FAČR would begin to work willingly.
If, in the fourth General Assembly, the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resented.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemians' case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of young high-performance soccer players."
"With this I don't mean that I would do it all by myself," Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can engage in a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, go on with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not showing up again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then the others would also be defeated."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, just like that," he said.
He is also motivated, they say, to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, much of the work that I don't want to lose is over."
"There are processes that had begun and that would have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced, concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"After him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do a football for everyone, because that's the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind doing everything I can for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It wouldn't give us the current situation where we only have three teams from Moravia, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although the fight against the presidential elections was joined by Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of the guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he claims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In case he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and he would not significantly change the staffing in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for me," he evaluates his Rajchl rivals like that.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Blue Jump
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their legs tired in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and half, there was something he could not miss in his luggage, a swimmer.
Lying back on the water, he looked at the artistic dome at the top, swam towards the marble angels, waiting for her on the edge of the pool and was amazed at the thoroughly restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the "fortress constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, Meder says, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom enthusiasts have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine ivy, while amateurs to run can breathe the fascinating smell of fir woods or listen to the cheerful trins of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The water surface duplicates architecture.
The chapoteo in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pools is so great because they cater to all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "In place of soil, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the coloured tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, above all, it gives the desire to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding examples of his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest are the waters with nitrates in a singular karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some hot springs, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászbereny).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on Zurich's indoor swimming pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains rise steam in winter, while at the bottom the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
A Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur in the baths of Árpád in Békscsaba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamus sticks to the skin when entering the pool, enjoying the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for nice places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit the discovered pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, was found with a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the shattered windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow among the tiles.
The decline counterbalanced in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only neoromanic elements of the construction times can be discovered in 1844, if not also an Alhambra style Arabic hall, added in 1900.
Since its great modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit merging different architectural styles into such a fantastic unity," Meder says.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter very much.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank renounce its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the consortium chief wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, to 84 percent of Germans it does not seem acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents claim Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocacy campaign is specifically addressed to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar way.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have uncoupled from bids and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than the American competitors: He promised to review the demands and said that no business "merces to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Bets at rising food prices show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is found to be the biggest bank lobby, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
"It's the same if Ackermann deals with the people who are starving or the Deutsche Bank's fame."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than that not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he needs that he hardly cares about possible losses, that's what his successor will do.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many of the bank's clients showed personal consequences by discovering that their bank was participating in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all the investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would not recommend such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The flag moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with lofts and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now it's reopened as a show house.
The modern postgerra architecture is passionate, the clear forms, the glass halls, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix de Arquitectura for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture to date.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flat building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, rose after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South Station, was renovated in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century was opened inside, the "house 20" was called.
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly decaying.
At present, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which belongs the house, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the Salzburg modern art museum, carried out reforms with the insistence of politicians and patrons of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation homonymous, there should be a café and a bookshop and a office building should also be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he substantially reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with glass fiber was installed and the glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still Schwanzer's pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old shades of mahogany and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this with strict control on the part of the memorial office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of rough ground in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, recently stated Krischanitz, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness."
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has happened a stroke of urban luck. The totally new and planned "town of the central station", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another construction of Krischanitz, because collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city about a nearby place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a winter crisis package that reaches millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train failures in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the failures and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 totalling some 300 million euros.
For what must be achieved a better availability of vehicles and the rail network even at an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from roads and pathways.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles necessary for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of Deutsche Bahn, warned of failures and delays in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transportation of passengers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations under adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the high-speed trains frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the rupture of an axle at the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays billionaires in the US
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem emerges, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA recriminations many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimised risks.
These securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for credit cooperatives in the United States and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
NCUA is attempting to reinstate the losses of millions originating.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other large banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of questionable mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the destruction of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind blows today for the U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the highest number of applications.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from FHFA, which is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth over ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer companies or information technology because the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's business report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM offers mainly services and seeks computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is regarded as an honor.
Therefore, the information technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently developed on the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus promoted one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the compromise until now.
He commended management for the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, extended it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His rapid and infallible sense of money has provided him with the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock in stock went up one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and figures, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete.
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", the Turkish media doubted the state of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is revived again.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background to the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, it has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was thought to have been dead a long time ago, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of extreme-right-wing violence against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The discovered ultra-right network reveals an magnitude whose dimensions were not, even less, predictable.
"Does the Bloody Ideology revive again?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the contrary points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant at the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with wisdom, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil to the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn event of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Cohabitation was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
"Starts smelling bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, police behaviour and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long previously sought suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on, immigrants are lost, there is nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network.", writes "Selen".
This means that, if German internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the main criticism was the lack of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln survivors.
After the fire-shaped attack in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media shows again how profound it is, since then, the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort to explain and revalue extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for frank words.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now a German is running it.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, commending Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and letting go of friendly comments about his future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general director of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The president of the USB administrative board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been known to be advising the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of definitely necessary adaptation.
He is suddenly responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved that he deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal of Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the former so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handy, was combined with ambitious objectives, and also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always rated USB as a good bank model."
"From the current point of view, one wonders how could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was engaged in losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billions of francs for a compulsory convertible bond, by which it became joint ownership of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses banks so large.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the Swiss economic performance (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of the wealthy customers, who had possibly failed taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves an amount of $780 billion, reimbursement of unwarranted profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to helping in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for wealthy customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through misappropriation and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate operator's story happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it has, of course, not yet worked well with risk management in the investment bank.
"With the Adoboli case it is clear that the risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the risk controls."
So the idea of precaution arose, with which the Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break to the other side of the Alpine republic.
The safety depositories of Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of genuine chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters on Bahnhofstraße Street in Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here buildings are hospitable, rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the confectionery Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front there are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate the "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point moved the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, in the end he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, it believes, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
That's where the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long grown accustomed to the customs of Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big gain and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS Crash" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you do that?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to make the two different precursor banks of the UBS complement each other: a rich but sleeping bank with the centre of goods administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could run a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to open up a step from bank learning to the summit."
Finally, Ospel ended up with Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The demise came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the chief of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps turned out well.
In the foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares it was at the highest.
However, the advisers of the companies responsible highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of bank "fixed income", there is enormous compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid to growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk US investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks looked for the downfall for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
Posts in the UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, who runs a large bank, he has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on the management of goods, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decrease a lot, it is now clear.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of as a transitional solution in the 51-year-old Italian-Suizo, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he was imposed: He must permanently direct UBS's business, the Zurich bank reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-90s.
Remove 3,500 seats.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a house with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the U.S. stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has frightened US investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remain in force.
Industrial production held back on the continent stifles the hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its origin.
The general relief of government changes in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back to a close-up, said Janney Montgomery Scott's Mark Luschini.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.

What created skepticism among U.S. investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of the investments, only confirmed this precaution, is still not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, said in an interview for the CNBC.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles around the edge and enters the U.S. technology sector.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supports the contribution of the traditional consortium's shares and makes it contribute against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.

Intelligent fats spread in cities
In many places the fats are considered "problematic birds": these very clever animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the fats have been in the city's image for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are piled up for the dirt and noise of animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
Fats no longer leave the cities, the experts say at the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected groups; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing edification and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
Fats are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district fats was launched by the negative media headlines.
Critics have called hunting animals by trapping birds and killing them with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and running them normally does not get anything," said Werner Klöver, an urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees is often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are diverted, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
It is only imaginable to escape them as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, opina Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of running animals from sensitive residential areas and onions is possible to re-enter their places.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a spike in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the fats of Ascheberger, where letters inform about the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the fats not only take advantage of the resources to access odd little ones, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University checked in four steps as far as the intelligence of the birds comes.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a larva of moth.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape that the stone should have to fall onto the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning fatheads had to solve a complicated problem.
Researchers placed a small cube with a pulley larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get to their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them with a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket on the tube shooter.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hopes in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal gulped to Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the party of going, made the five shares of the Eurocopa followed.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs game back with outsider Montenegro, after the party to go (2-0) made things clear.
Croatia did not let it be marked in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1/0) slip against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African world play-offs.
In the Stadio da Luz de Lisboa, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a free direct from over 30 meters to get to the head on the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his dowries to score from far away and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the goler Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, English leader Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the carrier line (33.).
Jiracek was right for the Czech Republic
Then the Wolfgang Stark College in Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of bosnia punishment, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card to be thrown to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark called a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Contrato, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European Vice Champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended up with the last doubt in minute 81. with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Bundesliga Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, Gatekeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal on his own door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic duo in action.
Damjanovic marched in the 40th minute of the front turn, very just at the Cech's doormanship.
After the rest the Czechs had to protect the world-renowned porter's larcenary, the front of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end decided the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of Zagreb’s football marvel.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat at the 2002 third-party bandit, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
At 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. The attacker Kazim Kazim also couldn't send the ball inside the carrier.
Following the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be scored.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who took part in the 62nd minute in Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish have held their first Eurocopa participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the go-to match prepared for a previous decision, got in the head in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had its first great opportunity.
From the very beginning, the defense was able to avoid potential goals of advantage.
But in the 32th minute, he advanced it.
After a defense of porter Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, getting the 1-0.

Personal Massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long dramatism character of the kind that can make one fall the soul at his feet.
Here are some tips for acting: Start this page gently and make it your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novel story, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treats or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It deals with "senses, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines experiences in times of war of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from school and botanic to climbers, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives blink here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the rotten trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on their hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an unmissable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Faithlessness," notes Mr. Englund, "has filled up with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his previously published memoirs, letters and other material.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and settling them with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl, she says, "Sucedans, everywhere they are."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the food that's going on in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed meat fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, it observes, "837 substitutes allowed for meat in the production of sausages, 511 substitutes for registered coffee".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that smitten and snuffed breast."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing, one would like to think that could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it's horribly like "a convicted person being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the cattle of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and convinced ideologically with good clothing that runs his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to escape the service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of pos gonococico, which the soldiers buy and embolden with it their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rubbed it on their eyes, which often gives rise to a blindness of life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war "disappeared exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No News at Erich María Remarque's forehead, instead of integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a cherry.
After a false step ahead, an assault planned per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
Monday night was chosen on Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence stressed how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
Recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had been prepared to see occupations developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapid mobilization of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know who were called for this, didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but they quit when hundreds of protesters came up before long after they heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved police officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with a high crime rate.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming out of the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when it was the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with foci and loudspeakers gathered at the crossing of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time to the protesters to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, Chief Spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units at Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense crowd of personal effects of protesters, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic stuffed with clothing, teams from the Department of Cleaning continued to pick up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, displaying images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were fired from each other by their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the candles.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clearing operation was completed about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "alteration of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "he wasn't running the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will demand the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst-paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a hearing at the City Hall last month, Education Advisor Dennis M. Walcott said that lay-offs were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be dismissed.
Municipal District officials 37 said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Education Department that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the formal submission of the complaint at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as accused, and has eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all Black or Latin women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on his specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's poor areas to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been insufficiently subsidized chronically.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36th Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it estimated the additional funding for each poor student enrolment in schools.
The union also asserts that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessive" describes more often the act of transferring a teacher from a school's payroll to a work bag, the salaries of which are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed," says the complaint draft, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that eventually Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi to be captured and killed and America's participation came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "valente".
"This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya, at the beginning of rebuilding its country," Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan statement of support for your democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a large bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "welcomes the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "clarifies the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the committee.
The spokesman for Place said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Chapter, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that in fact achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not so far succeeded in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budgetary balance amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wanted to limit the number of terms of office that members of Congress could fulfil, while representative José E. Serrano (Democratic for New York), wanted to remove the two terms of office for the presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic Secretary for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as an amendment prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 amendments to the 110th Congress.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Talk but not defeated," Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a constitutive act at Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's song "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned as a surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, Giffords, 41, replied, "Fine enough."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special program, which was released on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar passing through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband animates her.
Months later, Giffords sits on a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frenzy of the lips.
And then, his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "all", a request for change in their breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who had been in therapy for two hours every day, said he didn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords an article on the murder of March 12 when she arrested him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Durous, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marine children broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some sort of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they did.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and a often distant, sometimes adoring American audience.
The troops are given praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were hurting those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive one for the military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations about pity are conducted in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two children returned from fighting with the Marine Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Canancia warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "dirty, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly if he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian reminded his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that is unfamiliar with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said Lieutenant-General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praises of politicians and the public focus to a large extent on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the scope of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who had a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"He sounded an alarm signal," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"You're from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within a few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military staff eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to get the army's major plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The High Command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted with her, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by present or old soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
By a ruling of the 1950 Supreme Court called the Doctrine Fairs, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the complainants' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them have died in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, Burke says.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, besides hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them the discharge of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the manner in which it handles profit claims for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine bills have been submitted separately to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Bureau for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are markedly underreported , and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which is about 13.5 percent of the 19000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases in the army came to trial - half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times apart from a multitude of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about her having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work--I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dispensed from the service under less-than-honoured terms, which prevented her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his colleagues in demand continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strong against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted that he had been killed in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log on to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the British DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's personal information range is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic features with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new dietary band or product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
"It's a totally new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online advocates of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their activism in line with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "Like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "supernova data" is generating a rise in research, driving the number of academic papers with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that -- you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, from Wisconsin University and her colleagues, found that university students who spoke about their drunken facets on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with their drunkards.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Child Research Institute, said the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "hitting" its own population to obtain data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and the Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the mid-term of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information to which it can be accessed - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make available to others its large amount of research data).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching, liking or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that he carried out with students' Facebook public walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that an investigation topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and the wall's messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a laptop subject and a pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Friend and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described to himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templars of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a survivor from Utoya told the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It is possible that some are accustomed to the July 22 attacks as being an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it seemed."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, are shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared it to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview to Jobs recently rediscovered that has been unplugged as a progress of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of the products.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds (The triumph of the idiots) about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, they had barely been 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and already worked intensely in their new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Job's death that a full copy was discovered at VHS in the manager's garage.
This archive material, slightly reedited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that reaches the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seem surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing their thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also times when Job Perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing it to move faster towards the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the Job career, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
How did you learn to run a business:
"Throughout the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings in detail their efforts to simplify Apple accounting.
Dismayed by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made in the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make calls to long-distance free.
It has been widely written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here by describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and shouting through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone next door," says Jobs with a chuckle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think there would ever have been Apple without it.
Jobs continue to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst into caskets just before the Pope was woken up to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first board computer ever done."
She was as big as a suitcase, she had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time on that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products about the march.
Soon in his career, since he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, he asked a customer if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before she led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"He says you work in IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading companies and the people responsible for the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken care of the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - set them all at once...
In the end, everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What made Macintosh big was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were handed over at a dinner sponsored by the signature of lawyers who will file the case before the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study thoroughly the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the application to court and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historical allegation is expected by March, and the result will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's firm of lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which states: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honored guest, or appear on the agenda of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawmakers in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the demands of several judges who comply with the rules of the court that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were handed over in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have outstanding cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that say they mix too easily the activity of the court with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as to now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record $18 billion order
The Emirates airline requests 50 double-pass aircraft Boeing 777, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of your product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes is a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its worth in dollars - 50 double-pass Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates Airlines in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the 2011 Dubai Aviation Hall.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, to assume fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over one billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but they do have an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful for the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is earning money with the oil price increase.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide aircraft market and helps keep track of its Airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air fair took place four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range.
The shares of Boeing Co rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, reportedly defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón states that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to Governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped incline the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... took over the polls, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have been slightly overtaken by Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderón's birth status, and he elected Michoacan to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidatures for fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the elections in Michoacán seem, a victory will help to drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest fastest growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, Italy's debt costs have been dangerously fired and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to join forces to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the 1 200 thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point you will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and leave on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly run companies, and to generate losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the Eurozone crisis threatens "important chain effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "downside risks" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts that are coming together could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already directing $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now it is afraid of an additional reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "sequestration", would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects not run - you cannot buy three quarters of a boat or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to turn many of our civil servants away in an involuntary manner and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to release civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously harm the good disposition."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although wartime financing in the accounts of Overseas Contingency Operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disruptions in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the contract that supports war."
"Nominal personnel would be reduced, giving rise to delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which you can live, and certainly it is not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the United States' national security, and it must not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent Senatorial warnings increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about the possible cuts, despite having come to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential opponents."
"Indeed, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delay in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed previously throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping F35's additional development and testing could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that said that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "piled" with an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his scorned quickly rebuffed by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with infractions in the financing of the campaign related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have provided the exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Men who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades in prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
Liars do look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years investigating scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "minders oriented towards themselves", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their couples than those who are not married (but lies that they usually say tend to be "enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called creating a baseline.
Helps to provide benchmarks to measure later the changes.
Observe the posture of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's better that you know if someone normally hits with his foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavioural groups.
Consider these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture significantly, or display a "post-interview shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all difficult questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely show that the interview is over just to look for that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson shoved his leg to the bottom and used his past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraging trade unions, as it appeased environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it's willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win the approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's executive Alex Pourbax says that the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will be approved over time, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater are studied.
"This is a real way forward," said Representative Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to separate any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the lawmakers in Nebraska opposed to the plan are blowing legislation to force a disengagement from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle allegedly claimed to cause a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the diva of record music, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, landing his little daughter to the point that she puked in fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much that he suffered "changes of personality, sleep disturbances" and "increased his fear of strangers," says his family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when Tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes, and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and started pouring the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle shuddered over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained in her surroundings and removed from a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but did not receive an answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it can to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when you're going to a kindergarten teacher who takes an 18-month-old child in arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of managing Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, called the change, which generated great expectations regarding progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice-cream impacts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 thousand 835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops were those of vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The drop in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in state unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed to be accelerated, as as from January to March 55,053 signalers were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate increased to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of people throws more than 74,000 unemployed signalers, an increase over the first half of 18,969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed at the congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration in detention
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state is not contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor prayers are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located in 7,000 375 pesos.
IED contraction
Along with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in direct foreign investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs from January to June of State FDI totaled $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent over the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounted for a total investment of 17 billion pesos in the year, mainly of tertiary companies.
Debt
In view of the economic downturn scenario, in July the State Government requested the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, even though the investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities would be aimed at reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2,600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has really been very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land that we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized from this new team of government, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year frosts stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederação Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important to detonate all the potential of material and human resource that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be done
The President of Copramex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better enshrines the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to achieve good results in various areas, there are some advances in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in its way of driving public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
They condemn him for 8 kgs of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted narco-menuist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of health, in his variant of marijuana possession for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narco-menuist circulated in a white pick-up truck, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues internally at the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
It must contribute to works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or being seriously delayed due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal social development indicated that while the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk by failing to comply with the Government of the State with the contributions it receives, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent is the State, and that until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of the works is made in force.
"It's almost 12 million what it's about to bring to you, and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we didn't have to delay the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for credit to cover the over 7 million who did not at that time contribute the state administration.
"We were already in the previous sex because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left behind," he explained.
Despite the State authorities' commitment to the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance Armando Villarreal to speed up efforts to ensure that the percentages they owe to them reach as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valuable "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree ahead of the so-called "analogous shutdown" from 2021 to 2015, when the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to complete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television subjects is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all actions in it for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand put forward by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President-in-Office said that he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive could not structure by means of general rules measures for public administration to prepare.
"I do not believe that if I did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "to cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "required the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite the fact that there are highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, by issuing the contested decree, in some way invading the area of competence of Congress, as the enforcement of laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative field, has ensured.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" account in Michoacán
According to the data presented by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, still without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" is a reality regarding the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data presented by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6,000 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, since the Congress of the State passed the reforms shortly before the completion of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative power and called the vote of the state representative to constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" since he has no right to "sanction or veto".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and enforcement in the record of the box or does not open in the possession of the President of the box; or, where there are errors or obvious alterations in the records.
In addition, the total counting of the vote received in all boxes of the election may be made where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the party's representative and/or coalition that applied to the second of the nominees.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary period, the difference between the alleged successful candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of partial counting are excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation there is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is just 0.16 percent, although without accounting for the votes of 129 out of the 923 total records.
His last will
Its ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his home town, this Sunday night, during Monday there were reconnaissances and a mass of requiem.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel's last will was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute on the side of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony at Camp Mars.

"His will was to return to Saltillo and let his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, so he always manifested it to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful, extraordinary man as a father, as a son, as a loving brother, and as a waiting man for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said it even got dizzy in the truck; yet, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good person, "I was only in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most about life: piloting an aircraft.
They give you the last goodbye.
With honors was dismissed the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute to the governor Jorge Torres López, who gave him the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Saltillo Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was highlighted in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in days past when the helicopter he piloted, along with the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six more, all officials from that unit.
At 1805 hours, the remains of the Saltilense Bacio Cortés (Cremades) arrived to be delivered by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major Jaime Martinez, in the esplanade of the plant, where he was already expected by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three abandoned corpses are located on Cadreyta NL farm.
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were arrested in the same municipality for organized crime offences.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot with grace in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened in the 1.5 km of the road from Cadreyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose barda is beige with coffee, there was the open gate paired.
Looking into the interior, about three metres away, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the authorities concerned.
One of the individuals wore yellow toy with dark mash pants, without shoes; next to him was another with white toy.
At least one metre was the body of another individual with a red player and blue cleavage pants.
The three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three persons would have been killed elsewhere, as no helmets were found on the site.
In the fifth barda there are legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes on the same and the gate.
They capture 11 in Cadreyta
The National Defence Secretariat introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadreyta and who were involved in kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine burials.
According to information, in a first event on 11 November at the Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one who was deprived of his liberty was rescued.
Three properties and one cell phone were secured to them; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called Los Zetas.
In another event on 12 November at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, Cadreyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
By marking the stop and conducting the inspection, the military found a long weapon, a shipper and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in the La Frauda ejido, who in watching the military attempted to escape.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government which will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the eurozone at risk.
A statement by the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume office.
Monti said he will present the result of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "mark is now well delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria employer, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to leave this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed Monti's technocrat-majority government.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a devastating new attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
It will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections advance.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he should be made up solely of technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are making it difficult to include political figures.
The brush of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tycoons
Of the 22 football players called from Spain, ten out of 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 convened arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 called by both countries for the friendly today, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of class A cross-election games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
That figure reached it on the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish football players who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity each year in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World Cup.
Tic footballers, on the other hand, possess a limited international rock in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the brain wheel of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Aries of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outnumbered the 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't approaching 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet debut.
The historic glider of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two-decade journey tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam’s bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band ensures that for them too it will be to make reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the founder member and bassist Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
On that day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the angel band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in The Nation on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican followers, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay for a few days there.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask you because there is a sort of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the days before.
What do their most fervent followers say?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learn, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What do you owe this to?
I think it's partially because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take a while from not playing, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us would think we'd be in a big rock band and have done it for over 20 years now that it looks like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and are very moved that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love creating music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big gangs.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's a rare thing.
From time to time, a city gang comes up, but it's a lot weirder when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still played with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange that a band like yours will stick together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trusted each other with each other's music and could not be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; yet, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we've been growing up, it's been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure not to be too on tour because it is easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it to you, without becoming enthralled by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
They're so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's any relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are doing now better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted on Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength on his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including a language cancer that has been operated four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said that he does not want it because he is known innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kg which has been combined with other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and leg circulatory problems, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit this Tuesday to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point on an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in all political affairs between the two nations", according to the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that caused Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of emerging and most powerful developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s "Graylist", formed by countries that did not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a free trade treaty (FTC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialized press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support" , since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of 3D time" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "sin" to hook the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to turn a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "Agressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this videogame Nintendo makes his way to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting of the fountain of the moustache will have to travel platforms mined of dangers in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies as well as a "playable Luigi".
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he gave procedure to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to wash $70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request made by the northern country to Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that a court had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he "did not put his hands" in court decisions and provided treatment to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The case of Colom involves an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional courts were exhausted in order to prosecute the exterminator between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the pre-extradition process, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the drop in marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support institution Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
This is added to the 100 jobs currently created for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dolling or in a position to fall into marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral period, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Advisor Ernest Maragall attended the event, and the former mayor's and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Gomà.
Also came to the great hall of Fabra i Coats, the current advisor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, James Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is, too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president set Trinijove as an example in the fight against bad circumstances and in giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
An okupada estate where they were made macrofests was removed
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupiers left the farm yesterday afternoon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the residents of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday afternoon voluntarily the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-fests that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from happening again.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of crowd parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the lodgers.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80 percent.
The owner of the discotheque notes that the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, as they sold the cups to three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure facility had to respond to neighborhood complaints due to noise, while, according to him, the discomfort did not provoke them to the guests of the club, but to the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The club manager explained that the nuisances were so great that it even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor in the occupied building, but over the past few months the ekupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even thefts have occurred.
In this regard, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and be blunt against the incivism that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police drove to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park the mountain?
The architects coincide in the occasion of the summons beyond controversy about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed a promotional Pasquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the City Hall convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question goes out on its own: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring topic to help when two members of this former caste of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact stands, precisely, at one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"Cable from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for their great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Puertas de Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think about them "such as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, describes the proposal for an "intellectual network" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that is today projecting public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and that it had in the area of the Forum "on the swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already setting the next step," that is, its overstep.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (GMP)] can lead to real disasters."
More cumbersome to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the valley side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a merely topographic question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity offered by the City Council to his organization to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("everything is correct," he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-cursions have been convened - it says - in the direction of the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This results, at least in your case, in the choice to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his opinion, that is, the town council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in all its extension, a zone of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and leaves free
After 72 days of trial, Casino Red's legal counsel granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that was followed by alleged blackmails.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal counsel of the Casino Red granted him forgiveness before the Second District Penal Court, which follows a blackmail process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee to allow the regional county to allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the State Attorney's Office opened a criminal proceedings against the mayor's brother and on September 2 was arrested and detained for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained in that place for 49 days after a second round-up order was issued to him after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office disposed of the crimes of rape and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the prison in Cadreyta allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was given a warrant of arrest by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigation, there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the 1.5 million pesos charged to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for the operation of the house.
This Monday, Casino Red's legal counsel, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the members of the gambling house was the one who granted the forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal was legally pardoned and there could be no claim concerning the process that was followed; in addition, he would not be required to be compensated for damage or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal owner of the gambling house, about 15:50 was ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazababal Breton.
The secretary of the Judge, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
He shall also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life and seven others, indicated that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right ones to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the quotation marks had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the research carried out in the impact area did not report the occurrence of parts on the ground.
"In a search they report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with suitable requirements for transporting passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the research can last for several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft upward terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aeronautical regulations, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports at the AICM were suitable for take-off, as the aircraft moves towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, low cloud layers were presented.
Selected paths:
As a result of the cloud conditions, the crew are likely to have sought a lower elevation and increased visibility of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of remnants of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and side-by-side trajectory.
The aircraft remnant scatter pattern suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
Evidence in the ship's remnants of some kind of explosion or fire remains undisclosed on the site of the sinister.
The latest results of the research indicate that there may have been multiple contact with the ground.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the middle sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was likely to disarticulate along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the arranged site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Leads Social Security research to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Childhood Obesity and Adolescents' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Biochemistry Unit of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research is invited to participate to the population whether right or not, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m..
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day, he stated that the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific feeding questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and hereditary history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger suffering such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that on Saturdays all participants were subjected to anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the aim was to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is the concern of health professionals for the alarming increase in weight in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity among children and 47 per cent of girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexico has 65 percent Indian American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows for the detection of any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are told each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the majority of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, et cetera) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt would avoid kisses
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signs sent by the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 berries each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the right one, the berries could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the berries, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to that of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and hence the formation of berries.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, high molecular weight molecules, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called Maltese, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes cracked, added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist warned in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, pointed, is bathed with asphalt.
As vehicles are transited and efforts are generated, it allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If modified asphalt were to be spread even better, the chemical engineer was of the opinion.
On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, is placed a last layer called a treadmill, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
As the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the treadmill also requires the appropriate thickness and the material that is made should be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is moistened, the water is spread inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of tanks.
In the process of formation of a bach, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of tanks and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the floor should always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid the frequent formation of tanks.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow to repair the tanks with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 as a princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the wishes of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as Colombia's new princess.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic lady rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Valecaucacan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many ask themselves is what did it fail?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision taken by the jury to appoint the First Princess lies in that it did not agree with his answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carte Leamos.
To the interruption the vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing myself, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is "The Beginner", it's a pretty deep book.
I now read "Criminal and Punishment", a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardour of Blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books that he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony he said he felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise as it happens.
And for everyone, please read a little bit, "The Beginner" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle burned her favouriteism.
A Bogotan journalist insinuated that as she was the favorite, the ovational and the candidate who was taking all the preliminary prizes (rete de gastronomy Oster, public vote for the best craftswear, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in his first presentation in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
While there was some certainty in both of them, it was noted that he lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Like at Home" program, of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was named princess "checks that the most prized candidate wins during the competition does not remain a queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there was error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For some reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her father.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for its defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the most healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen's preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorious, lowered points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his fort and he was charged here."
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in a bathing suit, a cruel Vatican was born last night, because it was said that this was the contention that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina since today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, which gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her rolling passage through Cartagena, was avoided the crown.
So it was the work of the cauldron that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A Californian lobbyist went to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November, a lobbyist from the Cali CTI went to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the coltage of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the sectional of the ITC, that week he played the "availability" shift to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for more than five days to get to the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e., the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of operation against Alfonso Cano a Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being of the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to wear Guillermo León Sáenz's decathyl card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopicist of Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, with no margin of error, which can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lobbyists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have fake ballot papers or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint and look for them in the database.
The investigator reported that, in a case of theft, he was touched by removing a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different robberies," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation found that a family member might be a suspect of the crime and, indeed, a mark in the bottle coincided.
Although this doesn't guarantee it was the killer, it does locate it at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopicist explained that in the objects "the prints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective combination is performed.
The "indignant" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters came to camp in front of Zuccotti Square.
A large part attended to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to get back under a court order to Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and trying to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters came to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the "indignant" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to recamp in the square, we're going to set up somewhere else and continue the legal battle for returning to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain encamped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already moved to show support to the members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property compound - is still closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for the same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from disbanding members of Occupy Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or forbids protesters to re-enter the park with shops or other properties they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, which he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The alderman personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests took place and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression."
The leaders of "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that lasted the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television Christmas Eve
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, he will be featured on the television show "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", aider in "Baywatch", friend of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian TV Christmas special.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (Baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, will appear on the television show "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Indian-born Canadian comedian who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas boy has the Canadian singer Bublé, who married Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "zorah" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of fall that began in March.
Since last March the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo set material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the gross domestic product data between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also means the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with a decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises in order to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Yen's Stigma
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "resolved values" chosen by investors who flee from the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbid forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flow line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September on the yen's quote.
As the markets continue to besiege the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not turn its guard down.
"We must be careful about the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that the majority of member countries presented more clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
As it lowered four tenths to the 100.4 points, compared to the 10.8 of August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, by hastening eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds the doubts once again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written compromises
Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit of the major European debt crisis, with the default risk premiums and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period agreed upon in his designation may be short to apply, conservative party leader New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the staff disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message leaves no doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse for the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he will not give his good approval to any commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still aware of the impact of the referendum in Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no final date either.
The Greek madeja still has thread for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a prominent place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades as the second donor of the issue in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essential" has stated that it lies in being a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations on the horizon 2015, and, "in particular, in the one that targets the reduction to half the volume of people living with incomes below a daily dollar, which sets the "poverty threshold".
Spain "keeps working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Ms Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many of the achievements" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit stands not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these homes will be removed from the poverty line in which they are submerged.
The impulse in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Dona Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project was yesterday worth the qualifier of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor baker."
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, I stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic goodness, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that micro-credit implies "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to those who close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
On the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) Congress on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, it was without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs directly depend on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open up a road in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Anxious for calming the moods inside her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes part to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of disease-related fraud
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a responsible family allowance box and to give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on sick leave.
First of all, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private-sector workers a fourth day of absence before being able to take the leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but would save EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on staff a day of non-remuneration in the case of low-employment (so far, they do not lack, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority re-table the subject of fraud, this time directed towards the abuse of low-employment.
"The controls will be significantly increased and, furthermore, if someone is found committing fraud, they will have to repay the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned at the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched that have normally borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than in the rest of Europe.
Let us pay close attention, first of all, to national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million in low-employment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, the drop-out subsidies represented, in 2008, 5 per cent of health expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.300 million.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and accidents at work, while 54 per cent is related to sick leave, which amounts to 6,200 million euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt conceals deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Sickness Insurance, indicates that in 2010, 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence of work (both for health and other reasons) varied between 10 and 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud is rather limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to systematic controls of sick leave over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term losses were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of dropouts of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adapted or unjustified; a figure of 1.2 million was estimated to be 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, i.e. more than the total cost of the drop subsidies and undoubtedly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadèmos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what was declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament; he also added that the 100 days granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve that objective.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as "the country's permanence in the euro area is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papademos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Measures of Austerity
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he has warned that his party will not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he was in agreement with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the EUR 8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee claims that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, as reported by the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code in a way that allows assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises this option and has been tried competently to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, as indicated by experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this respect is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive topic of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not constituted a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-competent persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
We recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not lead to less value in the lives of the elderly or disabled.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of a patient's health care, the situation is not so clear, as reported by the authors of the report.
Furthermore, its recommendations suggest that it is indicated in the Penal Code that withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and undergoes the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which called "manifesto in favor of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts into question especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus Reports "Complete" · Global Voices
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad protested yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bachar El Asad intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "give away power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime have already died.
"If Bach really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been undertaking since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that "consent has been strengthened against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly tough tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OHCHR).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, believes that the country "advances towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damasco from its functions, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "the plotted plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the military media and observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is locked up in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to finalize the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which foresees, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov has yesterday judged the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan of the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks the Italian markets and sacrifices for time
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time in the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" to recover the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and met today with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a wide program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the large small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
For its part, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, certainly of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "insure that markets will have patience and will understand".
Its designation by the President initially gained market satisfaction, but then the concern was raised, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team primarily composed of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "political".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain Parliament's vote of confidence before Friday.
Monti is committed to working, when he is in office, to take account of the urgency and the aim of Italy "recovering its protagonistism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the last few months, has called for further measures of rigour.
The Italian "chief of the leaders" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competition and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place around 200,000 million euros in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that agency of the United Nations.
The IAEA expressed its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme last week.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural) and participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact in 1995 with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to one Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as indicated by the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and crimes against religion.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as reported by the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that they have reinvigorated this type of crime and crime," the human rights organization Human Rights First said, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has been pointing out for a long time that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one responsible for the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, colour of skin, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little bit more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and a new tab called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those netizens whose messages ("tweets") follow you or follow you.
This lets you know if they follow up on messages, whether they subscribe to new accounts, whether they qualify as a favorite for any messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the general public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users have discussed the interest of this innovation with different views at the expense of "tweets".
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," @jemb123 writes.
"The Activity function will help me to better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom writes.
Austria
Introduction of a "gold rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition which is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian government debt reaches 74.6%, a figure far above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced at one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest every year," said Deputy Christian Democratic Foreign Affairs Chancellor Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the countries members of the euro area on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act of equivalent value.
The approach adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP each year, while regional States, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Node threatens with a new intervention in the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we see that excessive volatility occurs" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen reached levels close to the historical peaks produced by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has gradually gone back since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is re-listed on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those caused by the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was valued at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, since it is increasing Made in Japan products and reducing the value of foreign revenues obtained by Japanese companies when they are converted to the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild" after the seismic and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, who fears that the growing of the root yen cutting is weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right steps", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (EUR 47 billion), leading to the 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags drop.
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges sank a little more in the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and stood at 3,064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the yields of the most affected euro area States' loans, the stock markets around the world continue to return some of their recent profits."
"Inverters, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market players regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and exchanges will continue to be achieved in a small margin of variation, so that investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The recurrence of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, in particular, for a difficult country to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types outnumber 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year-old Italian bonds reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the rates of interest of the countries of the South, although also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time for the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating itself with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held on Sunday.
The difference of the types ("spread") between the obligations at 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favourable than 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has downgraded the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will be useful only if it looks at all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will lead to the duplication of electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be addressed to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case either with Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or with Switzerland, which is solely aimed at building state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
Berlin's election is going to be an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, for increasing CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's wind champion, of which 30% of its electricity is obtained, is also one of the big users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher respectively than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% electricity bill higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and ensuring the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would be realistic in the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not show opposition in principle to that kind of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 leading jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets that can create non-removable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would be the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion annually in French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electrician would run an EPR designed to run sixty years when your manufacturer's collapse is planned?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
Areva's development of low-carbon solutions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power stations and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for either the people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unparalleled natural disasters, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it all the electric actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow partisan emotions, dogmas and manoeuvres to dominate such an important debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) claiming from the past that France "needs no foreign talents, workers or waiters."
However, it is rarely considered from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone made Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over the whole misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will help solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be cost-effective electorally, but it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly those with low qualifications, by pressing to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and primarily engage in professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A Positive Impact on Wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants results in the arrival of nationals having a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows represents an increase in real wages over the long term between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants provide contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it has to think only of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little One, that this was something that was thought of.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot used to say.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The paleondy of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved and in many cases the Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the void of the nationalist hole: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effect, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is one that bends to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from their powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for people's sovereignty to regain the momentum of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The departure from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having struggled for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new point of death.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, Republicans needed to "make".
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europe.
Cards with "no contact" chip are generalized
The world hall of chip cards begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM card phones, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to the calculations of the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent about 10 per cent of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind in respect of the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted by 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million MasterCard Pass cards without contact.
In order to put the top gear, however, it is necessary for the banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically spreading, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the uncontacted system in the future," said Gerard Nebouy, director general of Visa Europe France.
Banks Try Payment by Mobile Phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is indispensable for the conduct of transactions.
"They're falling apart."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Credit Agricultural bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a case that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société General has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already "has certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These last few months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have been considering the group for some time as a community of unworthy enlightened people of interest.
A fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants are launching the fight against the impious central government.
The latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and the attacks against the police stations increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, gets death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and leaves its northern feuds.
The past Christmas calls for an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram re-attacked Abuya, particularly against the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of which.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover all security specialists from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simpleness and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more strenuous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans are spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Great Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulation of their currency", a key theme in a America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector into Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is almost drowning in an attitude that "falls" emotions.
He has requested a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also pledged military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I go out elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragged.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing, for his part, to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy foreign policy burden.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and their misrepresentation in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he was distrustful of the military interventions that generated a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, in the opening of North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly under the sea Russia with Germany.
Simbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the valve steering wheel that controls the Russian gas entry into the Western Europe network together.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first one had 1,224 km that communicates the region of St Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipe should be completed by the end of 2012 which will allow to supply a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents the airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it by closing access to markets in Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has generated a gap between the Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us in an organic way," said François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the Gazprom directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine pipe is made of cement coated steel to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for North Stream society.
Measures to protect fauna and flora were also necessary.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project's leaders gave up the control platform when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish permanently on the sea facing their shores.
"In case of failure, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller needs.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that there will be a leak, as they have planned joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the status of the pipeline is guaranteed by an underwater robot, carried out by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the form of a pure, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full journey days at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any need for repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined her.
These five companies have set up a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and exploit the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, the entire capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," Jens Müller says.
The financing of the pipeline was completed by 30 per cent with the contributions of the shareholders and 70 per cent with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an adventurous air, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Book is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine's notebooks with the present appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to release to the market a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (top skin), which refers to a barnized cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, with open spirit and cults.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its inceptions, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are seeking employment.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubled the average rate: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made for 15 years has been considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there's still a lot to be done."
It should be mentioned that disabled persons continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (a 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% has not finished the bachelor's degree and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the quid of the problem", says Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreprer para la Cité association noted that the surveyed directors have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, an objective that was laid down in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the establishment number "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies holding between 20 and 49 workers have employees with disabilities in their staff, compared with 82 per cent of companies with 100 to 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly party.
We will not dare to say that there was agreement among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the remorse gesture of his foreman against Turkey, the Belgian picker has nothing but praise for him.
"I rejoiced a lot for Eden, for his progress and because he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front responds.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to get in."
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for, finally, "bright".
Don't forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the 1998 and 2000 victorious campaigns.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
Certainly, that will particularly reinforce the "special" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
In a simple way, Leekens has made reference to pride on his part.
"I'm proud" for arguing "a party of gala."
"I am also proud to check, as "old man", that France "remains to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal is very optimistic about the return party against Bosnia (22h00), to be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party on the way, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes go by, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selecçao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the party of going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked it out of the house."
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal", said a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 percent chance of participating in the Eurocopa 2012", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz has relativized.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, though they also need to score.
"It is a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to exert, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave them no time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
