Members of the Wales Assembly fear "passing through Marretas"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) that their title should be changed to MWP (Geneva Members of Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Galy Parliament".
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, fear that this will cause them to fall into ridicule.
A Labour AM stated that the group is concerned that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
A Plaid AM stated that the group in its entirety "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MEP said that the group was "very open" in relation to the change of name, but he said that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, currently drafting legislation to introduce the amendments to its name, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Wales Government of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which recorded widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as "Galy Parliament".
On the issue of the AM title, the Commission favored "Galês Members" or WMP, but the MWP option was more favored in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus can be a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who will have to present a draft legislation on the amendments in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way in which the House carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they discuss legislation, they will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change in the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change in their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
Popular voting was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a complaint about its territory and has repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is no more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
Sinos de St. Martin shut up at a time when the churches of Harlem struggle for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently" today, I said.
"Bars have stopped being the living rooms in the neighborhood where people are heading regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the eventuality of the money earned with the sale of patrimony not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the point of departure".
The churches, added, can be replaced by buildings of apartments with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not give support to the shrines of the neighborhood that still remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore this will speed up the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was later embossed by a black congregation that performed his worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street shopkeepers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the truck.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the rail "the bells of the poor".
The specialist who played the rail in July called him something else: "a cultural treasure" and a "instituted historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first rail of the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest rail in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "would try to pass on the costs to it", in a bad way the fact that it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark causes injuries in 13-year-old teens in a lobster-hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster-hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as much as he heard the boy scream for help, then paddling in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just about enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted "I was bitten"!
I got bit!
The whole area of the clavicle was dilapidated, Hammel described what he noticed when he arrived at the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!", added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with cosmetics sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at £2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as fashion clothing and home goods sales decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores spread across the country and will be implemented in more stores in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand of supermarkets for ways to use exposition space used for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its beauty product catalogue with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Esseise, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of Boots stores.
The supermarket network is also reviving its Boutique make-up range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something more and more demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second one, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, opens near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing eating habits for small daily quantities in nearby stores led supermarkets now to make more effort to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble large stores, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing points of sale Argos in hundreds of stores, also having installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this strengthened the sales of merchandise products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended up failing.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenue from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy business three years ago with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a wide range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby abandoned 11 million pounds deal
Peter Jones, star of the Dragons Den, became "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for branding items for home and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones released when leaving the profitable brand in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furnicious" when the gold girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (the value of which could amount to 1.5 million pounds), meant that she would no longer have time to dedicate herself to her household and Truly accessories brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones would catch a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source stated: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at Marlow headquarters."
The experts believe that the release of this morning's presenter, who is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, given the large investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional delays in the release.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity programme for ITV.
A nearby source of Jones said last night that "We don't want to comment on your business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The US President has jokingly mentioned the criticism that he would be the target of the media for making a comment that some would consider "indignant of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in on it?
Trump said, in his feigned voice of "telejournal pivo".
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, and stressed that it would be a major step in denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are taking place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong I told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump has adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of the tests with rockets, support in the liberation of hostages and the return to the country of the mortal remains of American soldiers.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing hundreds of people to die
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been evicted, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases been clear to declare that they are not asking for international aid; that is why it becomes a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm sire in Palu, a poor degree of warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travelling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decrepit a central part of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has hit Mr Joko's executive at a time when he is facing his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long ending for the goal of draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's beacon, with his team losing by 1-0.
He touched his left before making a finish towards the second brake.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed towards the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq advance as far as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant coming, I gave a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won for 1-0 at the interval after scoring a goal in the 25th minute, of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this move, the blues advanced gave a heelback pass to Mateo Kovacic before demarcating near the middle of the field and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass in half-field.
Then he made a beautiful ending that crossed the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
This overstepped the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second beam with a finish with the left foot that passed through the lifeguard Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the Champions League at three in the afternoon of Wednesday, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency at the beginning of Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people imprisoned in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that disemboweled.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspected homicide after stabbing a woman to death
A homicide investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for suspected murder.
The police urged the people in the area to testify something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all who were in the vicinity of John Street at Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with apron cameras, particularly taxi drivers, who will contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the victim went to the location of the occurrence to investigate where she was found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police report that they are currently informing the next relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits of the building are prohibited.
When he was informed about what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in an hour's time.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly claims that "it's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediate outside area.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information contacting DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers through 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament has become the most recent monument swallowed by the contention of "historical revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, which recalls the perpetration by the Taliban of so many British cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure at the Palace of Westminster would become a target to slaughter.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a fully accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and celebration".
Pork killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to reports of local media.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a blood-cut artery, close to a pocilga in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, is read in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farming on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, he has travelled with the cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring pitigate.
In that pit, I said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilos, had attacked the pig grower to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his last name "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent him from attacking other people while the police collected evidence at the scene of the occurrence.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks to humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig with 300 kilos immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as a "stimulus".
"They're just kidding.
They like pinching, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
Rose hurricane remains will have to bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening by moving on the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to all of Mexico's north and to the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
At 5 am, Eastern Sunday Time, Rosa caused 137 km/h ravines, a category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to take shape a depression over the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northward into the south-west zone of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce heavy rainfall in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, filled with debris and possibly soil ablutions in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5-7 mm in individual areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in southwest areas, especially on much of Arizona.
There are possible sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unadvisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The strong precipitation can cause the ravines to turn into brave rivers and the thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation over parts of the southern California coastal line.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small wetlands and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season of the region.
Some tropical avocados will begin in Arizona scattered at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can experience strong variations of temperature throughout the US territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature within short distances.
There is an excellent example of drastic temperature differences across the central US area on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern part of the US will have a warm start in October, with temperatures that are widespread between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our forecast of time for the long term indicates a high probability of temperatures occurring above average in the eastern part of the US until the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw yesterday in six television stations the rapist testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting the regular programming due to a last-minute reversal: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford has declared to the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh slapped her while intoxicated and tried to untie her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen's number on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of spectators in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the audience that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then came CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was picked up by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained immobile looking at the floor while he was criticized live for the cameras of CNN.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power while so many women don't have any power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator's door closes, that he would have more to say at the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event directly hours later, when the Judicial Commission voted to make Kavanaugh's nomination proceed to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the appointee during the next week, something that the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of abandoning the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and of harming the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the one he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the "Chequers Plan" of the minister for Brexit, stating that a proposal that previews that Britain and the EU cover the tariffs on the other side is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect of Sims's deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with murder in second degree, according to communication from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene of the occurrence and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA, news from WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After interviewing Simpson, the police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a gun.
A bond of USD 350 000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report referring that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the action group of Louisiana State Police, State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and area residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and in shock for Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us in permanence," Wade said.
Volcano casts ashes in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf and trembling noises.
Images of social networks showed thin layers of gray covering the car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Comparisons between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and police intervention, while thousands of people joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked up by the intervention police, hit it with eggs and threw ink into powder, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later clashes also occurred, in which the police resorted to rods to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups who sang "We do not forget, we do not forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long live for Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for mild injuries in the protests, and can be read in the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the 1 October referendum which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence overwhelmingly, although the voter turnout had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations spread across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it has been carried out, this manifestation has been forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we live our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having obtained a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have had difficulties in maintaining momentum this year, with their most known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was protesting in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested for awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament at next year's elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car fight against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had repeatedly beaten in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday by 7:30 p.m., UK summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there were damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot a beast against the automobile.
Menga attack gives a 1-0 win to Livingston against the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured victory
The Livingston, promoted to the first division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a technician of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference at a time when Gary Holt's team changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a win outside the house in the first division this season, faces Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face home the Rapid Vienna at the Europa League on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended to six games its succession of defeat-free confrontations in the division, with the main coach Holt without losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against cloudy visitors
Holt's team should have advanced on the score long before the goal, because the incisive character of their game was causing all sorts of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after he slipped to find Craig Halkett's headship on the beacon.
The house team was satisfied to let Rangers play in front of it, knowing that it could cause trouble to visitors in the ball games stopped.
And that's how the crucial goal arose.
Rangers granted a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to take the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and the network guard Liam Kelly had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by Rangers' keeper's feet, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow touched away from another liveston stop ball game.
There continued to be crossings to the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's investiture on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A great performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to overcome the expectations in this upward trajectory.
His style of play and his staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
Anyway, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown sometimes with Gerard, the team has fallen far short of these standards.
His final move was little inspired (only once they were able to open the team of the house), making a sort of warning to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then addressed Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were present in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, were also heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to host him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisional character of an acclaimed visitor as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car collision
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, near 10:15, British summer time.
The car driver stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in a leaking collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six wounded agents in trouble
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, said Prison Cabinet.
The still continuing disturbances began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m., UK summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Returned" have been called to solve the problem, involving eight inmates and is restricted to a wing.
Agents were treated with small facial wounds on site.
A spokesman for the Prison Services stated: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind the bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, last October, police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by drought can benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa cross the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for the areas of south and east Nevada, south of California and for Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct trajectory on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that crossed 60 km from the Arizona border".
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach the 15 mm in the Riglon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from extreme drought, the second most serious category," reported the siteweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation of 8 to 10 mm from Baja California is expected until north-west of Sonora, with a possible maximum of 25 mm," reported the siteweather.com.
The Rose will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south to Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or her remains is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest U.S. Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and floods in mountainous lands.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four detainees for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and one 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, close to 4:00 p.m., UK summer time on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two-year-old, and a 20-year-old in the Radstock area were arrested during the night, he told Avon and Somerset police.
The agents appealed to everyone who could have mobile footage of the event that they presented.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection vote of the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a session in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having strongly and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage on that day.
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote of one of the most successful legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a brilliant curriculum of public service," he said to the crowd of supporters of Western Virginia.
The president later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the republican voter turnout in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the leadership of the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the event," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency to reduce the effect of the Indonesian catastrophes (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not moving alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The Agency's public aerial photographs show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and slaughtered bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the massive Friday bustle was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the dimension of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels disbanded.
There were found bodies of some victims imprisoned under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage can be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area with the name Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300 000 people in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves appeared at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film published on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall fell down the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power cut that interrupted communications in the area of Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Donggala went through scenes of devastation on his way, said Mr. Doseva.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to start the dark tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign staff can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial disaster level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Then the government says "OK, this is a national catastrophe" we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist."
Upon the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the still disappeared still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in the rubble for two days next to the mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As a paragliding senior, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said that, in the hours following the news of the debauchery of the Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray verification mark, instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during automatic cash replenishment in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's official who restocked an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While I was busy, another man "came to run behind Brink's official" and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police through 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames Ye
rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The former known to Kanye West."
West, 41, received Ye's nickname some time ago and used it as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before their participation in the Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present their new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it by "emotional reasons", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for him a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one", for just Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was alternately known by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations in his name with or without hyphen and upper case.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to military personnel against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed not to use military force against civilians, at a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Military personnel fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that could have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and open more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double research spending in this area, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments occur after several departments of the US government have made announcements related to AI, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
"Duplicate the research budget in AI would be a good start, since all the other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in AI," Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the chances of the next great success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello’s best-rated American player. Later, he performed executive functions at Microsoft Research and was president of Google’s branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous U.S. government technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaires to work in AI.
Lee mentioned that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to give impetus to its efforts in the field of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be granted automatically to doctorates in AI," he said.
The Chinese Council of State presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee Restricted to Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour north represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the population of Macedonia, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout will be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was as follows: "Is it in favour of NATO and EU entry with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the efforts of membership in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament stated that it would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Committee stated that there had been no irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
"I have come to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter of the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of the country's name, which would open the doors for membership of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stick headlong and not for the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to receive Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value lower than the required influx.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the affluence must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failed referendum would represent the first major challenge in pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all Brighton's defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have obliterated Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro made it look ridiculously easy on your goal in minute 65.
The Argentine advanced received a pass in the middle field at the start of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
It was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing in the race more others within the big area of Brighton.
Then he made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced English used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, which, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's netizen guard with a finish on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," he told reporters Pep Guardiola, a City coach.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in confronting the Premier League.
That goal was scored at the 29th minute.
Aguaro received the ball well in Brighton's territory in this play.
He made a pass on the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues advance kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to hinder the life of the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the end for the Rockies, who hold a leadership game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to ensure their title of the first division.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level that I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the incumbent launcher for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, took a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right-hand player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of the republican influx in the interim elections.
"Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm fighting everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You're seeing this awful, awful group of radical democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to recover power using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, deaf and liars."
The president referred to the name Dianne Feinstein, member of the Senate Judicial Committee, having received soundings from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to leak?
Hey, hey, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerable for those who openly give their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was not a surprise for me.
After all, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was the subject of a similar treatment because he resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure has criticized me for discording Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the nottingham East Labour Meeting on the sixth floor mentioned that "we intend to make the meetings inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and gentler" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, if it has ever come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began a short time after Jeremy had taken the lead, because the colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and assume positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a stream of insults on social networks that call for "resignation," denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never fall back before them.
One of the aspects that most disappoint me in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advices over the last two years urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and so "it would do all right" for me.
But that's not what I came to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party for 32 years as a student, impelled by the neglect of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in rubble, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as an autarch or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "resignation" or political records will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr goes up
Two late trials have somehow biased the result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to succeed in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we remain unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was assigned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before mid-time, having marked and then converted a solo test to place the marker in the 17-5 for the Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a severe lesion of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried from a maca to the outside and, after the restart, the Ayr strengthened the leadership with a test of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The Ayr captain in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intensely charged pressure.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having knocked down Climo without the ball, in the penalty release, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the maul in progress of the Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe had collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent the wing Gregor Henry to the fifth rehearsal of the house team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which writes and participates with the long-time comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, soon to debut, will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "florescent Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landless country, expects the court to reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval base covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, is still alive the memory of a lost coastline for Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia awaits a sentence of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the delivery of the TIJ sentence on giant screens scattered throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of the claim of their country, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign way out to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," was the president's vote last August.
However, some analysts believe it unlikely that the court would rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even in the opposite case.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That TIJ's sentence is delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
"The issue of access to the sea was seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At a time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
" Bolivia will never dispense with its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never dispense with its nuclear weapons unless they trust Washington first.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy at a standstill, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Mr Ri mentioned that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and US objection to a declaration that puts a final point in the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington fears accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a generalized skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably views as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion Shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on their way to a store near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the walkway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their 2019 spring-summer collections, which left the style set amazed in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide tab, similar to a feather that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included creaded honeycombs of jewels, a hat of wizard and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high sewing.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this immense affirmation of fashion, you're lucky.
The stylist observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of the "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab which has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very little practical hat that spread across social networks sent another great creation to the walkways: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the bathing model that carried it.
The orange-burned raffia bag, adorned with raffia stripes and with a white leather glue, was the most outstanding piece of the spring-summer La Riviera 2019 collection by Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags coming to the shops next summer. Since the designer has so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, having this trend pursued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30 000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for further study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak with him in his own language, we can enter into his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot only rely on English when we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's recent exams, we find that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum classification of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital competences that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A UK Commission survey for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for employers' difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% were concerned with a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a fitness for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person at the forefront of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, the French language being the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with the best chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
The independent Scottish schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, whatever the future holds them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this.

LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers Coach, announced that James will participate in the opening game of Sunday's pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48, said Walton on the official site of the Lakers.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet claiming that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-temporary games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel from Trump County to West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign sessions tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending vote of conformation for his election to the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to strengthen the support for the mid-term elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The Trump Summit in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in Western Virginia online below in a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate's confirmation vote will stand by for a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this torrent of events is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
Thus, in charge of President Trump's campaign, he said that these five sessions next week aim to "power volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the campaign season's agitation," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who has resigned to be quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the soon-night rally will attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media from the Pittsburgh area," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him help in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that they have the strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon ants may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Pendular impulse oscillation is a fully invented sport concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the impetus will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so we're looking at it as a little bit of momentum, I would say," said Jordan Spieth while he was leaving the camp at the end of the day.
Europe is in advantage, of course, with four points ahead and with more than twelve in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them got three points in four.
Spieth has been dying from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those gutural shouts of celebration were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth departure an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the 15th match produced a similar cry, that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
"It is only necessary that we focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That is all that remains for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, which is unlikely but lovely, is four in four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on Friday morning's back nine.
In this series, and given the way that their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday is consolidated, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European victory potential to the sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both in different holes simultaneously.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the football hero this morning, when on a team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine shoved the Spanish and the Swede into a hole that they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or don't give, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played a better team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the struggle some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a strike advantage after coming out of the furballs and foursomes of the Saturday matches with a leadership of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the ranking at the Le Golf National, up to now, of four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failed American team in the morning furballs, winning the series by 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the foursomes with two winning matches, but couldn't shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12th singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duet to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup's history.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the furballs, they superbly consolidated the advantage, defeating a Woods without energy and the American beginner Bryson Dechambaau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, which was dragged during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius access, but already lost 19 of the games he played in four-balls and four-somes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze south-west of Paris, Europe has not always taken the best.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time winner of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet obtained a courageous 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup’s history a team reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk’s team, the title holder, only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "no thinking" of unilateral disarmament without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was aggravating the mistrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear tests and missiles, the dismantling of the nuclear test centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we don't see any corresponding US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed with our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, in contrast to the previous positions of Pyongyang.
Ri reported a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US President in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim undertook to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insist on "denuclearization first" and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, opposing to "the declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is aggravating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been reported by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If the interested party in this matter were South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea's rockets towards US territory was inevitable after Mr. Mau Trump called Kim the "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
Last year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much was still to be done and that sanctions would have to go on until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a calendar for it, saying that "it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously until the denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and declared after he would visit Pyongyang again in the month coming to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
Pyongyang left in July saying that progress had been made, although after North Korea denounced him for "making demands of gangsters.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "take corresponding action".
Pompeo said that Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" they were looking for were the security guarantees provided by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all of its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat machasta culture to study in caffeine-impregnated "directs".
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes he is the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after having concluded that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to pick up the bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "directing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fattening, because the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in the way of hunger, making them constantly starved.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler conceive of the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal overthrows Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another access to sadness outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team was trying to record their first victory in their run since the victory for 1-0 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the collective of Rangers, lacking inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers coming down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind Hibernian for the difference in goals.
And even more problems may arise for Rangers after the Calum Spence line prosecutor has been treated with a head wound caused by an apparently thrown object from the visitor's area.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that surpassed the Ayr at the end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven of Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in every move.
Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have dialed at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor beacon, but the mean wasted his great opportunity out.
A long free kickoff from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second stop.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in his game on the third end.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought that he should have been given a great penalty in the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers got only two finals to the beacon in the first part, but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly's netizen little had to worry about the finish of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the weak end of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal of Livingston at 34 minutes may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, as much as it is not for its tenacity.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs's long standing ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had immediate impact when the lateral advanced passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the lock.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to make a long pass behind a long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor did well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow ended up in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, again claimed a great penalty when he became embroiled in Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years old and continues to count ... the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like an uranium.
When we put these headphones, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now you're cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave the name still remains.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can see a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, has seen her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their modification in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancers", including those of breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to that involving removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" attacking cancer cells worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supported diatribe with a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, saying that he would run for the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his night song, with the name Ghost Town, in which he had a "Make America Great" hat, he started a brave against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hadn't been broadcast, West's brave scene was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to snap West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that it had been a bad time in the backstage because of the hat.
"They intimidated me in the back.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "put on my superman cover, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments provoked vaas of the public and the SNL participants appeared to be ashamed, he told Variety, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of song I Love it disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our most courageous spirits: obligated by ENFRENTARES A TURBA".
However, interviewer Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their "art") who I believe I am welcoming and propagating ideologies harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so did we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now "the former known to Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's pasts, also known as Puff Daddy, Pffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing Prince musical legend has changed its name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known to Prince".
Accusation of attempted homicide after stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Star of Throne Wars Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a writer like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval HBO's War of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of male hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the War of the Rose Leslie Thrones, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "strong position" on the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we've seen now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I believe that this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels of the War of Thrones when the series ended next summer, referring that, for him, the "fields of battle and horses" ended.
From November, Kit will participate in a re-edition of True West of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne War.
"I met my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded with Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the land owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, the health authorities said.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who had sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters neglects the leak of information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks the "dangerous lies" and the "conspiracy theories"
US Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the legislator's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" websites.
"Minds, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes allegedly the address of the households and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during an audience with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak of information occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published data from a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This groundless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak of information.
This groundless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie".
The Waters statement quickly attracted online criticisms, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is choleric," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not his responsibility, he can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You must reveal calm and serenity."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will compete for Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if true," he reads in his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Back to Attack - weak parody of spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for contact with Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and this seems in fact to apply to the new edition in the series of films of comedy and action Johnny English, initiated in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his scrambled eyes and an excessively elastic expression obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than all, that it is a comprehensive comic creation destined for non-anglophone film.
He is, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Glory Moments" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international mysterious traveler and man whose Atkinson role played on TV commercials for Barclaycard, who left the chaos on his trail.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter with a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a rail noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now offer with confidence comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is aimed at children and not at adults and, in my opinion, the bizarre misadventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to dismay the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total gap of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material to great flights.
Your secret services advisors inform you that once all the agents on the asset have been engaged, you will have to take someone out of the retirement.
And that someone is the disastrous Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an infiltrator spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us an academy of spies like the movie "School of Rock".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and join again to his auxiliary Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a fusing character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and the robin of the catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the Prime Minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic billionaire of technologies that claim to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd acts unraveled: disguised as table employees, they set on fire a stunning French restaurant, create confusion penetrating as clandestine in the luxurious Volta yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as it attempts to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but however nice and tempestuous, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is pretty medium.
And as in the other films of Johnny English, I was able to stop asking: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for the workers, giving them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping it tidy.
Sources refer to the idea of "fitting" the economic programme of the party, which redirects the country to workers.
The shift to a four-day working week obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party leader told The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review by the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one day to the next, but a four-day working week is an aspiration adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favoured by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the party stated: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from the hands of the "faceless directors" and the "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire share of current water business shareholders, as the Labour Party can make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers on the company's boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which may embodie dividends that may amount to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation Kavanaugh can make them or not change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the findings may lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a list of extremely impressive stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people at Central Park's Grand Grass, not only to watch performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways that contribute to increasing awareness in order to put an end to poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of the Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or this is just another case of "clickivism" - do we think it makes any difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion relating to those actions already disbursed or disbursed.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom bringing together investors and implementers committed to "help children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after having received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote to history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 lobbying actions on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous way - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements for civil and anti-apartheid rights that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will act at this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA Can Use the Navy as "Clock" to Put a Barriers to Russia's Energy Exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington can resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a trick alone" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the option of far cheaper for European consumers.
To that end, the Trump administration authorities, including the President himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, it is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for the presidency following the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the maximum leader," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will examine deeply the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an investigation from the FBI before the vote."
However, a poll held on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that it should be applied to the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts "probable" voters said that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support your application.
The survey revealed greater support for an application by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential application and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed for a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of the Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at a Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what's happening after he's back, I can identify with other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers actually get back with," said Donald Trump's audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "return a little different, return hardened, ask again if there is this respect for which his comrade soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave the country".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence over a woman and possession of a weapon as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a friendly statement curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, reported NBC News.
The complainant's full name in the Grace vs. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person said that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but the US authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Resources Council that allowed immigrants without documents who had been evicted from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates that principle," reads the amicus curiae statement.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the police ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "avail the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"A asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of politics on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubles on a counter-watch to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35 years old, mother of a male febrile baby, comforting him in an evacuation center in the razed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents who returned to their destroyed houses were sighted to try to save everything they could find among their waterborne belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Accuses China with "Intimidation" with "Advertising Ads" · Global Voices
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely drawn newspaper in the Iowa state, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in statements to Reuters, have designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an ever-increasing trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff vacancies on imports of the other.
China's retaliation rates at the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts say.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and American companies.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now setting foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertisements in our free press."
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press publishing a paid announcement at Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have from the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may lead to a negative reaction, particularly of women, during the mid-term elections taking place soon.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they wish to move towards a vote.
These things have no backsliding," told The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease revolted voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and national spokesperson of the Progressive MovementOn group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby, since the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the records," he said to the news site Stu Rothenberg, political analyst without party affiliation.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the indecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the appointee to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans advance with confirmation.
"This became a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about how Republicans dealt with the matter and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided on who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolute or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% stated that they believed absolute or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that they considered that Kavanaugh was likely or absolutely lying in his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI started an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford swore under oath to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her as an alcoholic when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the appointee to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when they both participated in a party during the period when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's open source code platform, Solid.
It allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal storage", or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal storage of online data is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteering programmers.
Beginning this week, world-wide technology creators will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are turned from avian from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergyman decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his 100-year-old city.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren dropped a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, stated that it was "brightly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that it gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns".
Then he ran into the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking one cannon alone and slaughtering three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never match but also a lesson of humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the arrest, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the arrest" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of the mixed martial arts all night long to see Bellator 206 watch instead of Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you get up all night to see Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 combats, with six from the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the UK were amazed when the cover moved to Peppa Swine.
Some did not get impressed after they were woken up early in the morning especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad taste joke."
"The government regulation says that the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to switch to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with marketing and communications fury, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will correct the schedule of broadcasts to include in the future UK viewers.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"But it is six Sunday morning there and we cannot resolve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday at the British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about his sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he grew to feel inferior to all because of his sexuality, but that this gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he didn't notice until entering high school that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he expressed himself in favor of the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The long-standing regular presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took a several months off as a result of illness.
Looking like a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and the strength to achieve success".
His goal was to prove he was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world trichamp said that to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "has caught me by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner last year, 20 years older, although he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we passed therefore when we are so young" - his first participation in the Olympic Games was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar highs and lows.
The couple had a son last June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all it mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had already the tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that you're not gonna be around to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding him no hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs spends on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, UK summer time.
Mickelson down in shape on the bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he's playing his 47th match on a Ryder Cup, but he'll have to recover his way to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's four-balls and four-somes.
Instead of being at the center of action, as has so many times been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the supporting role and the work in his field game, in the hope of correcting what afflicts him.
Never having given the most straight hits even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National camp, where the long rough usually punishes the wandering hits.
And if the camp itself was not intimidating enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, will face the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches they played for this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point downside starting the 12 singles, have a good start, the Mickelson match can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could claim much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who gave a lot to these teams in the past, and this week as well.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will exceed on Sunday the record of Nick Faldo of the largest number of games played on the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even matched the successes of its individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He is sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and is an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players have had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear at a peak
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that his loose leadership as he enters the last single day on the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental ride.
The Danish had its debut in the 1997 departure in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest margins, winning for 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a little while," said Bjorn, in the image, after having witnessed the victory of Turma from 2018 by 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go in there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we get the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I concentrate on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world".
Enchanted with the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What matters tomorrow are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our golfing skills are tested to the full.
This is the message that needs to be passed on to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek that their players have a better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself has already been on both sides of these big turns on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before eventually losing when Europe pulled out of the cart the "Milagre in Medinah".
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impulse moves to one side, the pressure is very great in these middle parts.
We've organized our crew accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I believe it covers all the journey," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The most recent frigate of the German navy should have entered service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failure and an exponentially growing cost, according to the local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the commanding ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow sending the most recent frigates on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have caused the last generation of warships, considered as a way for Germany to design power beyond borders, to be outdated when they enter into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Fragate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to the shipyards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota required in the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also noted that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, has twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase against the initially budgeted 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem has grown exponentially over time, because older ships have been put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands in order to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these singular flying mammals and to help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long-eared chestnuts and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the activities of bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Analysis by specialists of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, advisor to the conservation of the NTS nature, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, together with fly-kills and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, inspections in dormitories and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scotch bats.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threat we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there's still a lot about bats that we don't know, so the work we've developed here and in the other properties will help us learn more about what they need to flourish."
It was stressed by him that it was important to check whether bats are present before maintaining the properties, since the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitories can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate in helping.
It was by her saying, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are taking revenge."
Ronaldo disregards accusations of rape when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news," stating that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advance of the Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that you will then have paid $375 000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, characterized the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said to the camera the winner of five Golden Balls.
"They want to promote at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which characterized him as "an unacceptable account of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After they have found themselves in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga have allegedly gone to the player's room, where he has violated her anally, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he will later agree to enter into an out-of-court agreement by feeling "terroristd by the prospect of retaliation" and being concerned about the possibility of "to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims to cancel the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom would "repent forever" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary for Enterprises Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer reported that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of an agreed Brexit could lead to job loss.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Executive Director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, said that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of an agreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with the parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, border disturbances may occur, which the sector says may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stocks at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Chequers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use of this opportunity for us," he said to BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
While not able to estimate the stopping time, Toyota stated that, in the long term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could lead to job losses sooner or later.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union in this place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A spokesman for the government said that "we have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "retired another week" given that there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's advisors and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the dismissal of the Deputy Attorney-General, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of concealing conversations with Trump and the possibility of presenting the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I would rather not say goodbye" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with an audience of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh was witnessed and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation lasting a week on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press adviser, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it can be this week but it can also be postponed another week in view of everything that has been going on in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like protagonistism."
He then implied that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President takes more questions and answers than any previous President," he said, adding, without adding any evidence: "We have analysed these numbers."
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and have seen that we have done it in recent weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
The solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing casually and sometimes bizarre to the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit’s fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the gratitude of the country and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to costing applications for EU citizens' resident status working in the country's decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and decisions are expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and from other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers defense, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in the defeat of Saturday by 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tigers.
Coach Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the interval.
"He approached the side line and nearly fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical personnel put Abercrombie oxygen on the lateral line before putting it on a stretcher and transporting it to a deeper assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no information on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five pranks on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total of the season to 18 pranks.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when they purchase properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party has announced plans to charge a higher stamp tax to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people.
The measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract the younger electorate
The rise in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million per year to help homeless people
A higher stamp tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in homeless aid, will announce Theresa May today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and tax higher incomes.
The rise in stamp tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue to drive the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second homes and lease purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will allow up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a cut in the stamp tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining the prices of the high properties when they land land which they do not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon the quotas on affordable housing to solve the "disgrace of housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "unjustifiable" evictions.
It also assigns extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not as easy to buy home for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of their house has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep in silence remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to orient Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become a selecter in Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scots have been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeast club, now third ranked in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division at the time.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalization B," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel afraid of succeeding such consecrated names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, for now the success is summed up the "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It will not be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the title of champion at the following time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic career.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I've always seen more of myself in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I won my life as a player, and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt over my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
The restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good weather and England's career at the World Cup of Football, longer than expected, caused the June pattern, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% increase in sales, to repeat in July, but the restaurants experienced a retreat.
The drop of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restaurant in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated the downsizing of restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose 6.6% over the month, with meals falling 3%."
Paul Newman, a leisure and restaurant analyst, said: "These results prolong the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors that influence the out-of-home food market sales.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly damaging when added to the increase in cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not reach a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector-wide indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hides from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in five children - some only 11 years old - has secret accounts in social networks that hides from parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growth of the "false" pages on Instagram
News exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "primary" account to show parents
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts in social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students stated that they had a "primary" account that was innocuous to show their parents, having at the same time private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that Teenager incited others to rape her.
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keep private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most medalist of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and world community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited that I can act as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to helping guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-meter test at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at BBC, stopped walking after suffering a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "Today I suffered a month of stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
It's been a hard job but it's achieved a total recovery, I've learned to walk again and I've even done agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Lithium extraction bomb announcement compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk extraction bomb company divided their opinions online with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed cows in the herd.
To mark the release of what is described as the "first silent portable milk extraction bomb", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom given by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled cowhouse to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm tidying up, but I don't have a tail" and "You haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refractory continues: "Bombia, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the spectators, with many saying it relieves the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"It was a sad decision to use cows to announce this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born," wrote a spectator.

Another commenter commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone also said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted to find the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is brilliant," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at the workplace) and feel like "vacations".
It is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs hosted in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and it fits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, take their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and Creative Director of the "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time that the Elvie bomb was mangled.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded at the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be taken into custody.
Traditionally, most of the "parents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, afraid to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to record their fingerprints, the data being shared with the authorities regulating immigration.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified before the Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied for the release of unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the fathers or members of their family members are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, in accordance with the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large size contributes to ignoring the signs of disruption of children.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends exacerbates the trauma with which many are already struggling.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to his home, although the war in the country was in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the House.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions of displaced persons.
He said that Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "all and any foreign illegal presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly by training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
Regarding the question of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some western countries" of "scattering irrational fears" that led refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in Idlib's last great rebel bastion created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear times" and expressed hope that the military action will see the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited "to the review of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
'Cause Trump's gonna win a second term.
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end their presidency in advance.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency of all time"!
At the moment, there's no sign of the spectators' fatigue.
Since 2014, noble hearings more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in noble time, a rise to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" program, about a chief of staff who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedian veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," he told me Scovell.
Chaos has a value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programmes, stories from Washington may determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury to which only the most privileged spectators can give themselves.
And yet, it is more than a citizen informed when we are attending the sixth hour of a debate of experts on the use by Bob Woodward of "with deep knowledge" sources in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bestowal leather blouse of $15,000 ("a piece of dress full of insolence", as reported by Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels'... hum... anatomy of President Trump.
For my part, I'll never face Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he's done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily twists of the plot (anthagonize with NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss any episode or stay back.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not brag about television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate's Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but after all they were right."

Significant external funding in the interim elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignation of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race in the same place.
The recent re-adjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburg put in the race the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his place elsewhere in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the ancient circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle sparked a hard dispute over the funding of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested extraordinary elections of March to the 18th constituency of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
USA considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then backing down
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the members expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the State Department, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about 140 million US dollars of American aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats have said.
The three American representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesman for the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on the internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study history
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report of the legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly directing his investigation to determine whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, at the same time preparing to represent himself to the voters and perhaps to be judged by their peers.
There are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to put Hitler on a coup since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
The Americans currently face several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Trump fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to carry out his duties.
Rosenstein says the news of The Times is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that is responsible for Mr Trump?
If we kick these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we are not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, she immigrated to America and, 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With an inheritance of these, how could it not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
One injury on the knee prevented the middle Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-point draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for higher flights.
"It was a great point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We looked at the game with a positive mentality and we got a point.
Perhaps we could have won close to the end but, in global terms, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope that we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; training is good.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep afraid of this saving-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they want to enjoy, few people have spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance industry.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not let them know their desires with due anticipation.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial consultant: Your consultant will also be able to help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choices for financing continued care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses or funding using your own savings, provided you have these values available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care prosecutor by choosing a person of your trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a prosecutor's office on their finances.
You must select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering from a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Are not only financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Men shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure as he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, at the age of forty, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries don't involve a risk of life and the police have asked for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities reported, and the number of deaths was expected to increase.
With the interrupted communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coast, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Sulawesi Central province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra originated a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes reached the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake of magnitude 6.8 reached the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, resulting in a tsunami that fell on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake reached the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mintawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a 29-year-old resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, interference in an investigation of domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin was arrested in advance at the pre-trial detention centre of Mat-Su, subject to a $500 bail, he reported to KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously, innocent," reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mom, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is before the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electrical and communication networks have been cut, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake reached the Sulawesi Central region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor rarely asks capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's Public Prosecutor's Office seeks the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October, on a bicycle in West Side Highway, Manhattan Bass, flying pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, in accordance with the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov executed him as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade now, the South Zone of New York had not applied for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, Uzbek natural, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of liberation, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accusers not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians should "feel pressure" from Euros, while one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Rear Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the United Kingdom "would have already left" if Farage were Brexit Minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionaries was emphasized by conservatives who advocate permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been debated in order to maintain her commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, to the attacks of Brexit's supporters, permanence advocates and the EU.
The allies insist that it will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have left," he said.
The Wellingborough deputy added: "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan".
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and intend to remain is totally out of reach".
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians must "feel the pressure" if they are hurried to betray the decision that came out of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and govern itself."
However, the defenders of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A crowd of activists pushed tracks with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the release of the group this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren planned to "seriously weight" the possible candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "seriously run for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, the co-man of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it will be able to face Trump by 2020.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in format for debate since Trump's takeover.
One of the participants asked him whether he planned to apply for the Presidency.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman in the top seat.
Arrest in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a shooting video on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at the head, following which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted his presence at the site, pushing a gun, recognizing having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was held 10 times in the past season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind defending his position in the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton face the end of the platoon traffic, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one round later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed it after a scurvy scurvy, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the inner part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, exchanging very late tires, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He just came to the boxes on the 44th lap but couldn't improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end up in the room.
"It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me overstep it.
The team did exceptional work, which allowed us to end up in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday due to her insistence that she did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, see how bad, malicious, and false people are," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the reports and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start with you?
Do you remember her answer... did you spread the document?
Oh, no.
The escape did not depart from me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The escape broke from us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape took place in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's allegations, I haven't revealed his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected your request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know that more, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the appointee for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would use the accusations in his favour.
"They are determined to regain power by using all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn't matter who they can reach, who they have to step up to take power and control," the President said.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from defeat on Friday in the game of the First Division against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants had an initial advantage of two goals with endings by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the house team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had won a turning point on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The first goal of Dwyer emerged at the fourth minute (3:35) following assistance from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the house team back into play at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that the Giants would reach the first interval in leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The house team reorganized and Bouchard drew again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, ensuring victory by scoring the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers get away from earthquakes
An Indonesian air controller has been acclaimed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to haunt the region, leaving many residents buried in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower waved violently at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on track, was safely taking off.
He then jumped out of the control tower in the face of the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Syrait said the decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We were devastated by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, referring to the disaster management agency of the country that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by debris that we can not yet rescue," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman.
Waves of up to six metres devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "At every minute there are ambulances with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is running against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that have taken over 550 people.
Airplane crashing in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after the fall of a plane in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that since Saturday afternoon, she could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Official entities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
The cause of the fall and the exact sequence of events is not yet known.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and bitterly in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming down too low.
"It was the best thing that ever happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had managed to crawl with the water through the waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said that the onboard assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small wound in his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working in a nearby mill improvement work also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 ft) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none of them have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the history of the night events in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday at the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in the Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstitute the movements of the 23-year-old Quintom Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained localization data from several mobile phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He turned it off from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start presenting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin to be analyzed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
The group The High Breed de Bristol states that the hip hop deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
Nanny of New York processes couple for dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A nurse from New York is processing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received by mistake a text message from her mother complaining that "she was another black".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed some fear when she found that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she presented for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T believe any more... a black one," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he noticed his wallet, a "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the bad performance of the previous African-American lover and who was waiting for a Filipino nurse.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is prosecuting the couple and seeking compensation for dismissal of USD 350/day for the six-month period for which she had been selected without a contract.
"I want to show you that you cannot go unpunished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't really mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"Would you trust your children to someone who had treated them badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
When calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said that his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are they going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the legal process proceeds, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted commented this way: "It is difficult to get into the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's a lot of fun to know this now, after Paddington's had so much success."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small bear to play writing the children's book, would not have led to the chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication had a bitter taste given its passing last year.
About Paddington, who described himself as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a successful son: we were proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken from emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications the doctors had given you to keep your heart working were slowly stopping it from taking effect and leaving your system.
He had been dead for a while and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or regret it because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to tell myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for her daughter's loss, embarked on the plane along with other passengers outside the test that she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I always got low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt enormous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post bridge cards to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any father to have to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45 and a resident of Lydney, said the son was a promising head with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said it lit up the room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "mergled in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so that they know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, or be a friend.
Do not close yourselves. You must speak."
Kelly Humphreys, Sharon Davis' long-standing friend, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after the mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
On Christmas Day, it was a rag, when the kids opened the gifts, it didn't even look at them."
He said his death has traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one's indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that in terms of what I had asked for - a time-bound investigation with defined scope - we could get closer together," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, advancing that he feared that the committee would "decorate" in the face of an entrenched partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is a merely temporary issue.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted Senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Bush's wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast the vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreases during the Kim regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters to North Korea has declined since the rise to Kim Jong-un's power seven years ago.
When citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 2011.
Park stated that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people are asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of deserters in North Korea.
Alone reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flees China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal and non-refugee migrants, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations in an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the House, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a shrill and sour voice, speaking of his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the committee's Democrats, appealing to the allegations made against him of " grotesque and conspiracy murder" organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton to have lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no condition to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behavior against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don't qualify to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Relations Court.
By the way, he added that, as a Democrat, he feared potential Kavanaugh's opinions against the Affordable Care Act (most known to Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of repealing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and preconceived to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it can't slip without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything strange, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me immensely. He told me that he was also crying when he was angry, but he had created a technique. When he was angry and started crying, he told the person he was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which I cried with inexpressible anger, being gripped by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be pleased that they've managed to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time Democratic Congressman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidacy for the Presidents.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run herself to the presidential.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who named the situation of "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because of his late entry, the fundraising was less than desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He discovered that some of his sympathizers would only give him $250, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came up - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bringing the message to the voters, instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Until she seemed depressed," Patricia Schroeder reminded her of the reaction of the media.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you now write in my epitaph?
"Did she cry?"
Like the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first save of the trade war between the US and China was deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of the experts, the removal of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year by charging important Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the stage of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods sent by China to the U.S.A.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, rising recently the rates of 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the U.S.'s steps and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will waver in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, the experts say that, if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing can result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the Asian study at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs claims that Syria is prepared for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the countries since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have stayed in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would willingly receive help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
