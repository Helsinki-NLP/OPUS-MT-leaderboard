White: tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang by throwing the tower in a6, after which blacks will only have two options: take the tower in a6 or throw their bishop to any other house of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and give mate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn of a7 with the same result.
