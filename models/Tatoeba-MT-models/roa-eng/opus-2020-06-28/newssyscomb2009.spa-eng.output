The triumph of the right populist in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought about the first approximate results, a considerable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the right-wing populist.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (VPV), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously staggered.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worr is still finishing the OVP which loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in terms of preference for the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice-canceler, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this Monday could be achieved at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such developments would clearly facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, that is, the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the right-wing populist - the Liberals (FFO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution clearly bet Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and descended from the third to the fifth post among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four-percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can get colder
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, then the Czech-Indian relations could be cooled, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is how the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and expect the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same way during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then the pardon would be possible," said the Czech Head of Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter the case is by getting the convicted "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of highly important Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the incarceration and condemnation of these Czech scientists to be a tremendous mistake," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said.
An arbitrary Czech a struggle on the seabed
I'm approaching an electronic wall map, which represents Australia surrounded by sea.
It is not, however, of interest to the continent, but a small lost point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Manage this slant and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms so far that they carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the firm land
Coastal countries have now begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, these rights were taken advantage of in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called Continental Borde, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental Border.
"Simply, continental Border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request by the given country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border of the continent must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert support commission.
The commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those from the last three countries mentioned have come forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its marine dominance.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the marine bottom area that the commission gave it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e., almost six times the size of its own state.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain to be gained from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so until 10 years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the Continental Border ends, the Ocean Fund region declared by Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Right here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," said Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contract-defined regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors the same as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom over there is accidental, it's something like a sea replica of the Tatras.
"A surface area of a total length of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee from the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of hostages the command of German special forces was at the place of action
In order to resolve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt are being reported.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the Salvation Action, the German special forces were also indirectly involved.
Therefore at the point of liberation were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the aircraft squad of the federal police, of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office also the experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As the spokesmen of the ministries reported on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent liberation, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as support in the place.
"Happily that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the southern Egyptian desert region to the hostages they were deported from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, the safe and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the air forces of Germany and arrive to Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the Salvation Package
The first U.S. Congress chamber failed with little or no saving package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial markets package by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the appeals of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the programme with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to over 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concerns of investors that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture the desire to travel from the Germans remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume of 31 percent more in comparison to the same period last year.
According to the GfK research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in numbers.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 per cent higher than in 2007, DVR reported.
The basis of the results is GfK figures which are the information analyzed on the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened dollar course, especially travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
The preferred destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "best calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again went up - even though according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, lowered.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneario, the beer in jars of one litre and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A start at a tent.
Actually Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional custom Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in tent, photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering above all because I am the first time in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist in the Oktoberfest from the north of Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after reaching Teresa's Prado everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suit or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A municipality draws my attention to my apron that had dressed in the wrong way: "The left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widowed."
O God, now I bow behind the left.
"It's okay," he says.
The others don't care much about the subtle methods of flirting and wearing hats where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, from England and is also for the first time in Oktoberfest.
It seems to him "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me after he put his glass next to a liter of beer that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others aren't very lucky and can't consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock in the night, health groups run around the party and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - all of a sudden there are four people who bring the covered streets from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, come back drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from alcohol and is on the road.
"They are the ones who "can't do it anymore", gave me the answer to a health care answer to my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, Brentwood City, was implicated in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then, he has been released on bail.
Turkey Expands on Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers nestled in the desire to penetrate this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-renacentist style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to clock the end of the platforms and carries in front of two towers, one for each corner, resembling all a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office was over, there was no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that is curated to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and stayed away from history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all Eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a journey of shocks, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus
that has aroused some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business costume - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I brought it, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey in its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," she tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Church might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that election."
He then stressed one point that almost everyone I had spoken to so far had recited to me almost by memory: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to the East of Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the ferry to the terminal that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt in which the continent will be to which this fascinating country must claim.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (left, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21 years of age, but at the time when Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 years - we only refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether not accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this young choir was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's the only way to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too flowery.
Anyone outside the musical card, always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any means, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in their words, simply "sold one or two war horses well known all over the world."
We'll miss him a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) he states that "in 1946 economic history studies resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco et vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They called me attention for their simplicity and for the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to catch magical moments."
Second assault on the Honda Supersales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolum presents an even wider interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Progress in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolum are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation is introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although jazz is less known in Europe, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most popular car on the market in 2002 and also during 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows for increased sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm commercialized a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to notice to a large extent the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the trade mark expect to complete the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which means 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent decrease.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Also, the Japanese firm expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota, trust the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the distance between the axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double-bottom system - rises up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with engine 1.4, since the capacity of the trunk of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - are an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And it is that the doors giving access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will have two gasoline propellants of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves an excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-litre mechanics obtains a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This thruster - which previously reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the former thruster, who in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now goes on to have 100.
This jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Safety Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of the brand's vehicles.
During your flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks a lot like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes composed of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a micro-processor that immediately results in the prevention of collision.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels in straight or larger angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even megagas."
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan vaticin will introduce into the series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tender before mortgaged
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid for injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on waste mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a slim and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or messes.
The stubborn aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think of one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
Of course you have useful information, but little detail.
It is more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is over?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because if we buy a better house, we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock exchange quotation.
A week after finding an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9,9 % of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at the price per unit of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, ensuring a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be based on a price per unit of measurement of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action lost 6,79 per cent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, the general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's larger names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought that participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated into a dilution of about 20% of the benefit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capitals provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group nevertheless refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have eased his balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their stock exchange quote fall to half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt took off.
This cost was set back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers broke out and Merrill Lynch bought, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the common project of Venezolano Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, for example, his colleagues and friends, a draft for a new Constitution was put to the vote.
Mission accomplished as 64 per cent of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80 per cent of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the electoral centres and a non-governmental organization's count had announced a comprehensive victory for the "yes", estimated at 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night on Monday.
The " Constitution was overwhelmingly successful " , he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians who headed the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, to be held in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, by reserving the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and by foreign currency sending their emigrants.
Held by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, who can make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and claim a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives under the poverty line.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 people abducted have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane at the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately carried them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they could not speak to the press.
"They are well-healthed" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages were held by 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari on all sides in a desert zone at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
" An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, others have fled," said this one who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent from the "relampago" unit to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the Sudanese army, he claimed to have intercepted an all-terranean patrol aboard which the kidnappers, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place in the headlines and is taking place in the current electoral campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the wretched sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or hungry national historic sites?
What politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring it only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped into 211 societies of history, of heritage, of archives and of genealogy worry about looking into history, preserve with little money piles of private archives and preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten graveyards.
For when, a monument for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalise part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank which is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the US market: the three countries will support in total with EUR 11.2 billion to this financial and insurance institution which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s head of economic competition.
The Fortis Bank was the first to suffer from the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves over a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its businesses, including mainly insurance activities, purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of Fortis began a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company's shares of only Friday decreased by 12 percent, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the sudden fall in the shares of Fortis to the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the actions already showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already made sure that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the banking offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in Chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies are often refusing to sign an insurance contract when they see the data on the purchase of medicines.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which are linked to the use of recipe data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox chicken" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the follow-up program of medical prescriptions.
Insurance companies rely on the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation for the health status of the customer and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the customer to medical check and signed with him the contract already knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the client identification number he easily gets from the pharmacies the list of medicines bought in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion on the client's disease and state of health.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol tablets, it indicates that your blood fat level is almost incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Many versions of the program circulate, some even set a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are little difficulties in this.
Among the disadvantages of the program are, for example, that some medicines are multi-purpose, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-enhancing factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and combined them with drug consumption data obtain more accurate information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and it is increasingly difficult to control its use simultaneously.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that gives the authority to control companies specialized in the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot refuse approval, because otherwise insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So that the hens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union duplicates its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other major global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit which began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office of the Council, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Senior Foreign Policy Representative, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase their trade to more than EUR 100 billion.
Given that the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides have a great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollution emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, as should the next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced to 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder food price increases and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that the French companies will be charged a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire missing a year ago.
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire missing on September 3, 2007 as he flew over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3000 meters above sea level, in the Nevada mountain area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
the commissioner of Madera County, John Anderson, has dissipated the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is the very thing about which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said in a print conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found on the plane or in the vicinity.
The billionaire, 63, has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Security Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of researchers has been sent to identify the device: it is Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's connotation, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their house in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firstfruits.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's spin on an aerostatic globe: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later, he had made the world tour by plane and without ladders.
Among his memories, also that for having flown 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A Suv outside the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born among the trucks all land "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the suv Glk, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unpublished mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
At the Trivenet, they play the prohibition of access to sports demonstrations.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Other Italy" group that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they never met the rival's fanatics either.
The group's extraction is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have been added a small group (time units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
English fanatics are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski ones.
Figc had made 144 tickets for the party available to Italian fanatics: all with names, so they could easily be controlled.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the ministry of the interior hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents us from frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand any more in a stadium.
Thank you!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that those few fifty may be added to others.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," the Ministry of the Interior says.
That's why "well-open eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, i.e. the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the arm raised during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...."
This is Domenico Mazzilli's (not happyly expressed) thought, for a few weeks now the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that was previously by Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist – he adds the Observatory's #1 – the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will consider it for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: those are not also a crime, but if they allow they are not of education ...."
