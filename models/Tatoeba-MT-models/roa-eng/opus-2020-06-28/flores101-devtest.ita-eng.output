This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely disseminated theory, but it provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown in the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration in the lower part.
The discovery also allows you to obtain detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachid, but has other typical characteristics of feathers, beards and barbules, the researchers have concluded that the rachid is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for the flight, but rather for the regulation of the temperature or for the courtship. Researchers assume that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the exhibit shows an adult plumage and not the chick feather.
According to the hypothesis of the researchers, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage to be adult and not that of a chick.

The bill provides that on violent video games sold in the State of California a label is affixed with written "18" and makes it punishable the sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 for violation.
This morning, the public prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for Companies vacated by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla has reported injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blinded by an eye, lacks a section of skull and his face has been rebuilt into titanium.
Schneider testified through videoconferencing from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, the Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. 36 other competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race in which he participated, the giant slalom, saw him rank tenth in the female group of the category "sitted", with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female shooters failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy General Inspector DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their face covered.
None of the three people who were home at the time of the car crash got hurt.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road in which the accident took place was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Cambridge Hospital.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's court with the accusation that he killed his own son.
She is detained awaiting trial and trial, but any testimony made by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have considered the publication of potentially prejudicial photos.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who publish photos or other subjects suspected, walk on a mined terrain".
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has informed journalists that no new comments will be made until at least the formal act of indictment.
According to what was caught, the subject of the document will be the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such presence for only five years.
The shooters in the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals were to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received training and comprehensive safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee set up Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing burns of small amount to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) claimed to be aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company defined as "not serious".
In his reply, the ministry called the report postponed by Apple "absolutely depreciable".
The Marianne earthquake was struck at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT of Friday).
According to the Northern Marianne Islands emergency management office, no damage was reported to the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of current tsunamis.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage to Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his rifle M16 Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages were saved, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins traced his father's footsteps and started a doctor's career.
After being trained in obstetrics in 1959, he went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor in leisure time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would have accelerated lung maturation in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His wrestling companions also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin' comment on "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people who were opposed to the transition from Australia to the Republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch in Australia.
At the opposite of the survey, 29% of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three teams at the Commonwealth Games, but accused several disturbances that led to doubts about its physical form.
He could not take the drugs necessary to overcome the pain because they are banished from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known until today.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that led to water and organic matter on earth, that is, matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how the planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having clashed with comets a long time ago.
Como, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he placed his signature on a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing but "quickness and political idiocies."
A presidential candidacy is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete technology based on ground radar, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, while parking for cars or interchange parking is not available on site.
Fears related to the absence of the means of transport have revealed the possibility of making the game compulsory to closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday on Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic twig of Darwin, Geospiza fortes, and the clutch of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any type of form. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and intertwined. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate images painted by hand in books called "minial codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the red cabbage juice it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on what is acid or basal (alkaline) the chemical element.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions mean protons to which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
Among the humidity present on your hands and outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, remains of sewers have been discovered in the homes of the Minoic cities of Crete and Santorini.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public bathrooms, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost immediately.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and visual.
In order to transport a satellite or telescope into space, a high rocket of more than 100 feet is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their way to the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other mid-sized cats that feed on medium size prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in freedom) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and which allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion's flock acts in a very similar way to the wolf's or dog's flock, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other great cats), even as regards the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a tensile strength five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but looks more like a sentence of howling and rabid words.
The birds love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the birds follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, creeping to the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the oceletti camouflage with the surrounding environment and then plunge them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves over a mountain chain or river, or moves over a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment different from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to become a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passing of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it always resembles less and less to the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled from them (through the aspiration).
The plants make their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mustosaur was the superpredator of his age, and for this reason he feared nothing, except the other mousasaurs.
From its long faucets came more than 70 sharp teeth as razors, plus another row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had the language biforcuta. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other musasauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their foods would seem familiar to us, the Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual courses, such as boars, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on the chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on a side while eating their meal.
Of course the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for every divinity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes particular pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurat, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was scarcely populated. In the Nordic sages it is said that it was Erik the Red to give her the name, having met Greenland on her journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Despite being all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you saw the movie "The Mystery of Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
However, this is false. Although something has been written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of original independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down to the document.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches for 24.5 inches) has been rolled up to be put back.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only put as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still busy.
He was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragon".
The American and French Free forces had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
Civility means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term in turn is connected with "civils", that is to say citizen, and "civitas", that is to say city or city-state, and in a certain way defines the dimensions of society as well.
Cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being so recognized as true civilizations.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of its acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and taxes between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary. These for their part had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national is, together with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, basketball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor races.
Winter sports are more widespread in northern regions and they see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, it refers to Japan as an "arcipelago", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing from there shortly recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East Indies Company in 1624 established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that concerned Aboriginal cereal production systems and taking Chinese armbands to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal zones of Taiwan ended up under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared the province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus giving way to the sovereignty of Taiwan in Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration works are still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film used on the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its relationship of appearance is inherited from the formats of digital camera image sensors.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derisive rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where positioning the main subject corresponds to the intersection of lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was called upon to be examined.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European States for over a thousand years, despite the differences in language and costume.
His omnipresent power has influenced anyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civil supply, despite this blockade it violated international law usually accepted and codified by many international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain has undermined international waters in order to prevent access by any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate underwater campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and efferatities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Bachelor (his former manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or any family that was to power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, fierce wars were lit up among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent times in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to gain a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all candidates men, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army classifications, instead of being class-based, are now based on calibre.
The French Revolution has also been a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived over time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave lies on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
It is not really easy to find, even if you knew the existence of it. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around it. From within the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only arrival in our days not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honour of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses many pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), several smaller tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honour of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "articulated up" looks like a V and the indication "articulated down" looks like a graphette or a square without the lower side.
Upstairs means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down it means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the arch toward itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it results in a stronger and more determined sound.
You can decide to add your personalized pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archery you find printed have a musical value, so they should in principle be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, in prey to terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Maria Antonietta, to their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Luigi Carlo, 4 years old) and Elisabetta, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At some point someone among the crowd showed the frightened queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the exploitation of the Philippine people during the time constituted profits at the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII century (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which concluded by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or from technological imperative to the narrow sense that the destiny of man is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has the "effects" of societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture have emerged related to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued approximately until 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its prestige decreased, especially because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and the XIV century.
Initially the clothing suffered the strong influence of the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of the ways of communication means that the spread of styles in the West may delay from 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie the clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised for the sole purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually biological system that uses semi-preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at achieving maximum harvests.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
The subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished according to age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children that due to neglect, due to misfortune, or the effect of intentional abuse, have grown without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or savages. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their parents themselves): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been reared by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning even simpler and more interesting, while caffold goes a little further.
Scafolding is not a learning mode, the more a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, how can it be using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small assistant in the form of Microsoft Office staple.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and have the purpose of interrogating, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given up for various reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nutrition, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving trusted parents, stable education and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the rent will meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratification.
For example, important motivations for using the Internet suggest "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording allowed to arrive at significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements of the duration of a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying to interpret micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand the spoken language because of brain damage are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even maintains that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century the research showed the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and express variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of variables expressed.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backward between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy their needs for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and eventually even death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not surprise that our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as today's savannah chimpanzees.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking up.
If I decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Minor is tension, more positive is the existing vital force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and appeasement.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This objective is hindered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but it has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayano rite and by various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is founded in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in a path of omnicomprehensive love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (light energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various divinities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the conflicts of system, procedural and cultural, caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of a time had become enemies; thus the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have been fought for truly, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been sunk; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the pact of non-Soviet-Polish aggression and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time contrasting the same ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German military navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros mountains in Iran.
They began to be reared by ancient cultures and tribes to have easily available milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually reared in herds left free to move on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used nowadays.
Already in the 16th century, cars were built in England.
Even though they were simply made of parallel wooden boards, the cars, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that travelled them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively soon to maintain the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even if the iron caused greater wear and tear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place to the iron wheels. In 1767 they made their first rails appear completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Humans have begun to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "heavy man").
His predecessor, the Australopite, did not usually walk upright.
Marks of specialization for biped gait are present in the fossils of Australopiteco dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent the future sufferings we can start to adopt lifestyles more environmentally friendly, we can adhere to the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's typography a few blocks away.
The night was produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap manifests".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8th in the Independence Hall courtyard and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made her read to her room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 borders of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
Finally, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary or bit digits.
Internal poisoning may not immediately be obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a drug container or of open harmful chemicals.
Check if first aid instructions for that specific poison are present on the label.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with the beds' cymics, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both the killer and the bedtops are nidical, i.e. adapted to live in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States of America multiple sclerosis (MS) registers about 400,000 known cases, placing first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or in that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand the way in which the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
But this is not only about experimentation, because an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations makes it possible to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend in a significant way on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacteria.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and depending on whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those in germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism brings people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wild flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo's orang.
Every morning, people leave small country campaigns to go by car to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic andirivians, they are all somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere beyond one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems, almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they thrown out every day? Are engineers planning them that they are incompetent, or are there any deeper motivations?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to the next and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of the flow of traffic is complex since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented in a mathematical way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the flow of traffic, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to stand out. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are benefitted by the ability to fold the wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small amphres to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold the wings are the dragonfly and the ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristotle claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone else he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't have the feeling the Earth is moving, do we?
The Rio delle Amazzoni is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Rio delle Amazzoni is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that at some points reaches six miles.
The total of 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The river Rio delle Amazzoni is 6.387 km (3,980 miles). In it the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries are poured.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were far more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in native form in nature and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually look more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys consisting of minimal quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil was thus a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a temperamitis.
We can just ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new happens.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission pump.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. Therefore, by further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down in the presence of a weak push or nothing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be larger on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the lift of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on looking for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and encourage them to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that they do or do not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are the Theory of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the Herzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to stay "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
At the opposite end, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the whole team's operation and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to differences between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, since meetings may take place according to the various time zones, which may not be covered by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible Team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is defined as the management team each member refers to and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to address the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason for implementing organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you can use all the resources available effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and engineering can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to satisfy the customer's needs.
In order for an organisation to become innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors may affect behaviour and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong scientific fantasy, AI represents a branch of very important computer science that deals with intelligent machine behavior, learning and adaptation.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behaviour.
Some examples of application are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to the diagnosis and questions of customers, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military field, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext to share experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennett School, North Carolina, design a website on their journey to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, their first experiences with blogs are often marked by a grammatical and unprepared spelling, but in general the presence of a public changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgment the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "make students more aware of the moment that surrounds them." The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop the learning of students well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's evocative and bilingual capital, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and the present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The vast northernmost areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost disobedient wilderness.
If we compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African Americans is higher than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent of its own.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations to France.
In the lands, the Arabs also carried Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape, from Europe to India, by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the road to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: everyone is recommended to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one looking too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenides.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of Casa Branca, who abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the most interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghilè and so much groceries, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to evaluate well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
You can use a wedding-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming metaphor of exotic and distant earth.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in UNESCO's heritage sites that are in danger because of the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its most abrasive touch in Africa, the city is clearly distinguished from the other parts of the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located north-east of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support to a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, represents for many tourists the main destination.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a brilliant bar graph, even more evident because framed by Victoria Harbour waters.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit Kowloon's waterfront.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has concentrated on the heavily populated, restored land on the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to leave.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest part included in the Indian territory is named after Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 real tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 deer spotted.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because often service buses between different districts are full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the river Oyapock is a strangled bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tracks have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two long lanes 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the space in free vertical is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic occurred only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-madic hunters and also practised subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the Polo Fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches even at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo games, please contact the Associacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on peripheral islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to trade the Falklands currency off the islands, so you change the money before you start again.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: rarely temperatures come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature less than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no "dried" and "dried" seasons defined: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile it may seem: bison, moths, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, tens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not kept a proper distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking food with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the sadly known shipyard of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamase Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the trees of pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops. You can take a safe bath.
The best known local beer is a not complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but Australians and New Zealanders could better face the journey.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. The espresso' is the short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year many excursions are carried out on the coral reef and accidents for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubemeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can only find them occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep him away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of rivers estuaries north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once they arrive to their destination.
Travel agencies often conclude conventions with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers from/to the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also book for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide you with additional documents you need for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted before the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some musical festivals, most participants decided to camp on the spot, considering this aspect as a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you must arrive soon and gain a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music is extended until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the ice crossing causes quite annoying noises for those most exposed to it.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to devote to the exploration of the city. The passengers of the cruises is granted the exemption from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Generally, there are neither windows, nor watches, and exits can be difficult to find.

Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes shall take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in a very short time it can fall so much snow to make you stay stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the heart of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
The lions, the cheetahs and the leopards are sometimes fearsome and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari hiking", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. The first Olympics were in fact held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary among themselves, however most of the cancellation policies related to coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while normal tickets will cost approximately 7,000 ¥.
Stretching damp clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like to wear ironed socks, you can try it with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, worst of all, burns.
There are several ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In certain areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubts, it is appropriate to assess the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable holding.
Travellers can come into contact with animal parasites that are not spread in their regions of origin.
Parasites may spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that may harm or kill people with force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers travelling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow narrow streets and curves predominate.
The exposed speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the preceding and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely enough, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile telephony service is much higher than in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit cakes are an unassembled classic, from apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes are often accompanied by a cup of strong coffee.
Those who wish to taste sweets that are small but rich in taste can be guided by those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry may occur either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the hinterland regions, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional kitchens that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally indicates the foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Japanese cuisine, now widely used throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the yellow coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the rider's feet and are hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but can present security problems for the chance that the rider's feet will remain stuck to you.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has a foot embedded in the bracket, it could be dragged from the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later on, some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather bracket pull out of the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite in South America, where there are a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Scalars from every part of the world continuously trace new ways on its walls, potentially infinite.
Sports on the snow in free descent, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and provide for snow slides thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (swimmings), who dedicate whole holiday periods to ski activity in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans who ski date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-track, ski mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it usually does not include them, to skiing or skiing, which are practiced on rough terrains and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to that of hiking.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances in some way greater than those you walk, but only very rarely you will reach the speed of the cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries you would need to apply for a visa and pass for passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay inside this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass the passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus obtaining a saving of time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a artifact an antique piece. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences compared to the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America than in Europe.
Crafts could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar objects produced in series.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade stands is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were always involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer especially as work animals.
Today many Sámi perform modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gymgar" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a warning for travellers is issued for the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or for your insurance in the event of cancellation of your trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
"Averse weather conditions" is the general expression that indicates any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social discomfort or loss of life.
In every part of the world, extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types of weather, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, higher precipitation and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to time, tornado, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Among the weather phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to learn about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may influence travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country potentially considerable as a war zone must support vocational training.

Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who have scheduled surgery to change sex abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for return travel with them.
Governments' intention to issue passports without sex (X) indications or up-to-date documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents.
Safety inspections have also become much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass the checks without their privacy and dignity being attacked.
Rescue currents are constituted by the return flow of waves that break down on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
In view of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can be formed towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths occur due to fatigue in the attempt to swim counter-current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you're not likely to be trapped again, or consider whether to wait for the rescue, based on your skills, and whether you've been sighted.
The feedback shock is manifested in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a lower "moon of honey" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return to their homeland.
The play of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always feel the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The sound and light show is just like a book of stories.
Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest island and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands there are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of a still active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge in the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth mountains, a chain of 360 km cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as Catena della Sentinella, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Massif del Vinson, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone does not usually constitute a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you have to find yourself outdoors with visual masks up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including sports craft, as well as missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
One of the most popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among neo-diplomats, since they can take a year before starting the university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a foreign course in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of re-entering higher education in your home country.
Usually the inclusion of these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of the thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Nautical is Finland's national pastime, where there is a boat every seven or eight people.
This is also true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is between one and forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
A separate visa (starting from 2009) will not be required for the descent to the ground using on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can frighten people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar from the fears and personal adversities that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people to understand how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on the fact that they do not have control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies there were problems.
On some routes, air shipments would require days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to send it as a hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since the airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for trips to Business and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, flights from A to B are not even worth searching for discounts on first class seats or in business classes.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at destination, and consequently apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However also Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is that Christian-Orthodox one.
Smirne is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient town of Smirne is located on a huge bay, surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping centre.
Although in the city there is an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centres are lined with the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the market of the eighteenth century and mosques and ancient churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the sacred church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions around the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common pit, and it has almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many surviving men and women in these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones killed or made to work until death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid beating the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid disturbing these places by embracing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; the Spanish is known almost by everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is widely used also for public transport and other services.
By underground, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any interruptions of the unscheduled service are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
The Parisians are famous for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be to behave at best, relating to it as a "well educated" person. This will definitely facilitate your movement.
The rude outward appearance of the Parisians will quickly fade if you show off some good basic manners.
The National Park of the Plitvice Lakes is rich in forests, mostly of beech, fish and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also houses a great variety of animal and bird species.
In these places rare species live such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar chicken, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries make it available to the unprepared women, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants under their knees.
These too can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however the clothes are not washed after each user, so by wearing these skirts you might not feel at ease. For men, a unique size for everyone!
The cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is made of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa with Olives is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the possible condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All the nouns, besides the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that is for "Lei", always begin with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantial way makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most of the words are spoken as written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means blessed, while car means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and more of the regular times.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the precipitated conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Pre-modern observers are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in sparsely populated areas where weather conditions are favourable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, is part of Japanese culture since the third century.
The concept was native to China, where plum blossoming was preferred.
In Japan, the first feasts for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
The plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to even take "only" one example.

In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy to turn city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the hot (always) and the strong sun (rather rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses are also heading north towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and his wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inside of Hebron and do not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland watercourses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit castles in the Loire Valley and the Reno Valley, you can make a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can navigate the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions related to this festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition previews spending the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to be able to admire the dawn.
There are naturally Christian theological explanations at the base of this tradition, but one might well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional Churches a Easter Eve is celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with the congregations that often begin the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came to us swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This made the giant turtle become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Several mammals have been introduced to Galapagos, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night when the sun stays under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to attend the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost throughout the day.
Since the territories are scarcely populated, light pollution often does not represent a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Western people tend to be accustomed.
Office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or waistband and is addressed to colleagues with their last name or professional title.
Harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, since it gives importance to the Group's commitment rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the blessing of their superiors on each decision, and they are expected to comply with the instructions without asking questions.
