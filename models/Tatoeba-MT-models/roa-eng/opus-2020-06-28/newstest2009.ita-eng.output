The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downside is the fall of the actions on Wall Street.
So, even from us, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the local financial sector.
The collapse of Asia's actions
On Tuesday the Asian Stock Exchanges have experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day have subsequently erased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day deleted almost 4%, but then also part of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has dropped by 3.8% while in Shanghai markets have been closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses were 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will influence the financial markets all over the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong Currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer consequences.
U.S. stock cuts
The US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan on Monday, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech kroner) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday experienced a setback and the main indices of the shares recorded the biggest collapse from over a fortnight ago.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a similar collapse occurred the last time in 1987.
The index was already lowered before the vote, but as soon as the bill was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has given in: the US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will take place at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion kroner).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday he told Reuters, the chairman of the Committee for Banking and Financial Services in Barney Frank's room.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the savings, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
However, there will be a return to reality later because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, market aid will be achieved.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislator delegates met at night between Saturday and Sunday with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgages from financial companies, leading financial corporations to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan, but I think we are," Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the Monday market as a result of Congress's decision.
But for now it is not clear when the two American Congress Chambers will vote for the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some issues.
The legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may, however, overrule his right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to obtain finances to buy passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday's law and the Senate on Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's positive course and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the main spokesperson, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the division of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan counts on the aid to the owners of the houses that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments that it will buy with the aim of lowering the monthly fees for the debtors' instalments and will allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economics of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price problem assets will be bought
This will determine how losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, already this week, Congress representatives have reached agreement on the support of this plan and that they will baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment," Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why an autonomous reader should be provided.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you'd hardly buy a expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is no objective reason.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are piled on your shelves, a turntable like this at least you dream about it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply MP3 format.
Here too there are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players manage to do much more than just read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and send text, can read music and video, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even browse.
And if we take into account smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grid and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your mobile phone and before the indicator on your screen will require charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones manage to read music for more than twelve hours, only, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic cell phones are concerned, they cannot be counted for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get another charger to work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours of continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem arises when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create on their own a multimedia library ordered by the names of the performers, album name, genre or according to the classification of the user.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device interested in the resistance of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This now succeeds, of course, to any mobile phone.
You don't have to take too much care of which formats your mobile phone or reader recognize.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be right in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of the devices support the music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple company and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit, via the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is usually limited only to a hit at the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (either through GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little frugal in the pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and even with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones cost up to 15 thousand kroner.
On the other hand, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really does it to anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of hitting by mistake the start of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant ticket for the transmission of data.
Which devices to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which is covered by the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones also do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you also want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, take the specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the comfort of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this area he made more roads Sony Ericsson, which line walkman mobile phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 kroner, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic from this year on.
Maybe.
Perhaps the market for mobile phones in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
There, however, something is missing – a virtual operator who obliges traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
Because the Czech operators belong to the most dear in Europe we have already written many times about Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day ČTÚ confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularisation of roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really want to start the clash.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even when we have three mobile networks and cover up to 100%.
Instead, mobile telofonia operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the Head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) , Pavel Dvořák, has often said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities. (Of course it would be difficult to find other frequencies now.)
But there's still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which traditional operators should then react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, similar voices sounded in Britain like we did.
It has been shown, however, that the place for such operators is there and that they can be truly successful.
At the end of the day, for example, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator managed to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking lies the Penta financial group to which in Czech Republic belongs among the other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group-shop.
In order to be able to work effectively, many fewer customers than a traditional operator are enough.
They do not carry behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low prices, which is often in balance with the offer of the narrowest services
So for example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking shows in Poland can be a pretty good move even the bet on a band-bersail not recently.
This operator is specifically aimed at men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be affirmed by us as in Poland.
He doubts the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have many expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will take place rather in the other countries of our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman of the financial group Penta.
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything because they do not create any potential competitors.
For some time, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And it's better first.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl's spokesperson.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will have to have it maybe by the end of the year.
But for now around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we do not believe that there is space in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefònika O2.
The specific nature of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
T-Mobil Martina Kemrová's press spokesman adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
He adds: "In the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it would be possible to consider it on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses his attention rather on reaching his 3G license requests.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this especially in the context of sharing of costs and infrastructures.
We consider this, from the customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common fast mobile internet network."
The competent authorities - with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The troubles around the creation U:fon testify that when operators tend to one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure against ČTú in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to the public access information from the ČTú web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition environment of the mobile telephony market has been little strengthened beyond all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put on him and above all on his high claims."
However, the attitude of mobile telephone operators is surprising because of the complete lack of interest on the part of Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, in relation to the whole problem, has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, in the section for external relations ÚOHS, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not surprise.
On the other hand, the office which has to defend the interests of consumers, and on the other hand, the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and lower prices do not belong to the UOHS interest.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence, is raised on its own.
Equally as the same price of petrol for all gasolines is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he has no greater responsibility for his behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has- ultimately logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators proceed in such a strange manner.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators face very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a pretty frequent trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the whole thing.
This has already been found in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, he failed to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved Telecommunications Act was updated, despite the fact that many of these experts expected the situation to improve.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done when no one looks
While we do not see the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These companies publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
Usually it's companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only those established.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator appears as a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a provision.
"If the cases you are talking about, of which we will be interested, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of the cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the three companies mentioned can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a profit not indifferent and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile operators "
But this is supposed to be a strange minimum at Čtu.
In addition, another issue opens up for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has rights strong enough to expose similar activities and if it does not want you will not have to comply with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we're not more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a considerable decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, practically in all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - market too small, limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, regulators have intervened to defend not mobile telephone operators but their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him others have joined.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs throw each other all the case like a boiling potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But we don't throw away the sponge.
If the backstage information is right and the virtual operator will really soon appear to us, the Czech mobile phone market will be back on its way.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficult ÚOHS could remain impassable to the refusal (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday the premier Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"In the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the choir, have the clear dictionary, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year on the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov měj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" inno sounds
Wednesday MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which in the metro, tram and bus you will get the first passengers that instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in your pocket.
At the moment if you can get it about 100,000 people who own your Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30-90-day and annual paper (which will run from the first January 2009) and at the same time have their paper recharged in Infopoint and in the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be bought from yesterday on the Internet at the page of the Company of Transportation www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet service can completely forget the doors in the subway stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased via internet and on the Opencard they charge it to one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places the passengers have at their disposal a door with personal format that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their credit card acquired." said the spokesman of the project Martin Optrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can load the electronic coupons to the ATM and self-services that are installed at the entrances of the meter.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five of them all over the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, you will load it over.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is in urban bus and train lines from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In addition to the integrated trains in Prague there are the controllers with card readers with whom they check the temporal and zone validity," explained Philip’s ticket control by the Ropid organization, which sets up the timetables for Prague’s collective transport.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard to the determined point next to the case.
So the driver checks the validity of the charged coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the charged coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the paper.
The information on the validity of their documents on the screen of the device will be displayed here.
The South Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the Southers in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is reflected in the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States at least.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Germans from the South have turned to the President of the USA in 1945.
This is especially true of the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Zumava district" – occupied by Hitler according to the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for American unity to reach the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed with the words "People who hold the fate of Šumava with all their heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudeti hope only to brutality, the lack of regard, the misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to take the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed for anything, precisely for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," he writes in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of the post-war period, according to some witnesses it aptly describes the expectations of the then Germans of the Sudeti.
Even if the Czech Germans had to understand that it would be about their displacement from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted a possibility of this kind.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Holštýn, the tens of other Czech Germans went to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These people thought that once you came home, the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia was the pima of the war, according to him, he was told that on the basis of the decrees of Beneš they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Žebíček's office is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on the flyers.
You should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not for the last professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood, there's the word "you'll pay."
This should symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots will "spavent" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can commonly see images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is thus promised to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and sticks for drivers
"With drivers the carota and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
It is important to remember the risk to drivers, "says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would restore almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Israeli provisional government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert spoke out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all of them," Olmert said to the daily newspaper.
"We have a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He has admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the snoopers to pass on to him, as has happened to one of my best friends, to renounce a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the light of the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and tens of injured people.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City. .
"He who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he said.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert has also spoken for the withdrawal of Israel from the heights of Golan, that is, according to him the necessary condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Sciite Movement) ; they will have to give up their continued support, which offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Sciite Movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on buses?
The law does not recognize them, it is not possible to walk on the long distance bus
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Karel Hanzelka Ministry of Transport.
Last week’s incident with which he lost his life a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting at the time next to the driver in the less secure place of the bus, although there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can do an accident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of the coffee or newspapers.
It depends whether the bus is equipped with or not standing places according to the circulation booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers shall be seated.
Student Agency buses did not set up, confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz website the director of Radim Jančura.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulations forbid the carrier to carry out the services.
The law of road traffic only recognizes the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, instead, believes that the law corrects this problem quite well.
Depends if the bus has the homologated stands.
That's all," he says.
Categorize the buses in urban where there are standing and the maximum speed limited, interurban with standing positions with maximum speed higher and long traffic without standing places with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Not even there is sure when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can bang his head."
"If the bus makes a sharp brake, it is obviously worth the laws of physics.
Just like in the urban bus or on the tram.
The transporter company must resolve the security of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and he also believes that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only such transport that offers the services of stewards..
It takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider his craft dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling that I have to consider steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers while they leave.
They would also decrease spending," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostess, we're already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the incident of the line for Naples died a young hostess of the region of Plzeň, who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-haul buses, they are untenable."
The company has in mind to denounce the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but it expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport have been working for more than a year, could lead to a clarification of the movement of the stewarts on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They don’t consider them so much the buses, they take more care of the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone during driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewart to be a major threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesman Havelka, who is responsible for the control of bus safety by the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes focus on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB director addressed to the house employees.
In the letter published on Monday which could form "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" through the unit meeting of the bank institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive driving force for further ties in the area of the Länder banks.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the WestLB afflict is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by means of the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having noted long ago the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is drawing to search for a future solution.
Of the links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB certainly has been talking about it for quite a while, even from Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which for half is brought by regional banks and savings banks consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts thereof.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the ones that count most in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not the first time to talk about it when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank and the Helaba.
Of this three-man association, nothing was done.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved incapable of reaching an agreement.
The Rhine-Palatinate regional bank went instead to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that knowledge is created, that the various houses in the public sector must be brought closer together.
Since the Bavarian Parliament election has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
For Helaba it's not entirely good news.
If pressure for other mergers is increased, partners will be missing as soon as possible.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the much better financial crisis of the houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of the Asia-Turingia savings banks participating with 85% of Helaba, put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geostrategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are matched.
In June Merl noted that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet have been answered by the association of German savings banks.
The West LB division, which is naturally not wanted, could eventually come out.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts will work with the Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the barrel of 5l. of the brand Kaiser stands a barbutous massif and demonstrates to the about 200 travellers what are the deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena before giving Luca a package and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Beer Festival" , arrival scheduled 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they only travel Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not about the Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with false fur liner and a pair of glasses with silver-plated large stools belong to him buses.
For 5 years they have been going to Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
Nighttime, day at the party, back at 10.30 p.m.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the standards of Bavarian authenticity, the disease case and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the turn of the Brenner.
There's still no beer.
At a stroke the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowledge moving.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tendon, it means running!", says Mark of the morning.
"Run!" run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, let's not block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, split into the adjacent space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, howl Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet here again at 10.30 p.m. on time! Got it?"
We're already leaving for the party.
On the road one attacks as follows the yellow hats to the trees, the road signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as the "end of the Italians' week".
Exact data do not exist, there is talk of 50 thousand, which depart to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is argued that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco is strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which gives a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are ranked first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the tendon of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate funder Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to be able to protect itself from turbulence on the markets.
An experienced person told Reuters Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
Deep down are Depfa's affiliate's losses.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% on the Euro 2.37 million, and the share of its capital also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, gains from both question increases and certain shares as well as the liquidation of credit provisions fell by more than 70% on the 5 million euro.
Only thanks to higher income from the reimbursement of subordinate compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, did the negative profit result quite moderately with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were dispossessed in the Airel Bank.
Since income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors ( PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that dividends have been deleted.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important funder of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a portion of Depfa's credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the notice of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial requirements were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the inflow of international monetary markets mostly not functioning.
From other sources it feels, that thanks to the money the refinancing is assured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Steering Committee Georg Funke, on the contrary, said that the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the commercialability of the HRE Group is still assured.
This is hoped for by the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamic and imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Financing may not be used completely.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening the bank to what it learned was going to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share rate collapses 75% on the 3,30 Euros.
Loan courses are good enough.
While front-degree debt is almost non-removable, it yields the outstanding loans.
The loans of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are mainly affected, including the maturity of more than 2009.
First the HRE loans seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institute itself, which, with the emphasis of the Depfa, the crisis has come to an end, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, it can be counted on an amortisation of the annualities by the end of the year.
Or it goes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But as far as the information is concerned, because of the partial stateizations, the probability almost certain has become a justified hope.
Above all, it will create long-term investors some sleepy nights with the decision if they share their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future compensation tax payments on capital gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the school, should appear at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to retaliate: German is completely "Kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
First day of school in Japan
Like I was excited.
I also had the idea of going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo to Kawasaki and need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
The road I was supposed to find myself on my own, and fortunately I didn't miss.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The pupils arrive slowly from 8 a.m. until at 8.40 a short interview with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
In the meantime, I'm not the guy who speaks willingly in front of people, in addition to a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and leather shoes.
That's how I stood in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, re-digged and made a sign and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "nice, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me got hurt, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class hour had continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke disorderly and re-dangled and dried me with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
On the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me a basket for the lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and some kind of wraps with meat and tofu..
Actually, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a whole new taste.
Done is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salt, brr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to make the acquaintance of the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if you can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked my friends when I told, that I would want to go to school for a year in Japan.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I have read for years with fervor the Mangas.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little Japanese language.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
There's a lot of people here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - the opposite side: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach run away when they feel the danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it happen if, when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of well-known scientists have been published on the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impractical territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That is, he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transmit our feeling to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, associated circuits (this is because of its direct sharing with short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it misses completely.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic particularity should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is linked to language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is made, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of the consciousness to which for science it would be easier to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is precisely what happens in the short memory studies of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, first passes to the neural related consciousness that to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is meant by feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his conscious activities of the brain.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and, in particular, the human being.
With speaking nature you create subtle nuances of feeling, because we can distinguish and categorize situations with the help of words and grammar, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activity in the areas of the body of the sensations of bark and cephalic palae, similar to Jack Pankseep, which has, however, concentrated more on the palaeocephalo.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could definitely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I do not think it is possible.
Pankseep adds arguments about the fact that what for rats and humans appears as fear, is probably so noticeable with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans experience the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroache in the event of danger escape as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet show any vital resemblance.
And that is, neural confrontation continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalus, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even when it was possible to prove it for human beings: how would you like to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who know ?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, here there is progress on the neural level, as long as we abandon the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually slam against a wall.
I'm actually a practical emotion.
EUFA President Platini: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"This, however, is not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there's still a lot to do in both countries"
Both homeowners' countries stumble on the road map for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually the number of stages to be taken up by the Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It would remain "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many members of the first division only in the last season were sentenced for manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone to the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid Ribette Indignant
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has grain with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared adulterous his former Dennis Quaid.
He foams anger and rivets.
Roses War at a delayed outbreak for the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid spouses: seven years after their separation the two actors of Hollywood now dispute with each other a bad dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself on the grounds of the marriage failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The scope of betrayal would have come to her attention only after the separation.
The occasion for "the stripping of the soul" was Ryan's press work for his new film "The Women" – tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adulterous husband was clear-cut: it would be "unheard of," said fifty-four-year-old at the New York Daily News, which "Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship".
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son who had together, once again "publicly remembered the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is newly married and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are low
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial supplier and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a marked decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen by price.
From January to March the prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already at 3,6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as reason for this the weak price of the dollar, which would lead to a "heating desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26,3 % even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still rising:
Due to the increase of the kerosene, the passengers of the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range heavy fuel flights would be up to 29,2 % more expensive
From April to June the prices of Economy Class air tickets fell by an average of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, however, in the first class and in the Business price changes were far weaker.
In Germany, prices fell even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices had risen by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they decreased by 23,6 %.
As for domestic German flights, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be economic growth on the one hand, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has broken down.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on the open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
Sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes from Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – only in Europe was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, Hamburg's SV becomes a capolist.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the player of the national Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player entered the game late first and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was precisely worded, he passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena cabins.
The catacombs did not succeed much, the game break was over and most of them sat in their place again.
Rieger was for almost 3 decades physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys an even greater estimate of certain old players.
And so his tune also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol has annuated and raised the thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
"It wasn't all good to see here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "moved more relaxed".
For the 1st to zero those in Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric's head shot (11) and the fact that many weak players in Gladbach could not harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol recalled.
The SV in Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators already celebrated earlier, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"we're able to fix everything," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more evidence of the unrevealability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals engaged late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric port as well as Jansen blowing at FC Bayern – finds himself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol says.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
The experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the pipes of the fuel that freeze in haste it is now up to you to die for freezing.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon creates trouble – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/painting/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example on Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What the scholars have been amazed at for years: rockets do not behave completely as they would expect according to the law on gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year rebaptized the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have sighted in the cosmos.
"The responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only known about 10 years.
From you obviously comes an attraction force, whose effect on other celestial bodies is shown.
On the other hand, she is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any sort of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for ransom are already under way.
The Germans are always in the sight of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We're examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The rears of a shooting took place before the release of the hostages remain unclear: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would be ready to complete the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them in surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed on a ransom," the official said.
It would have been "still only to take over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed from Germany a ransom of 6 million euros; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report the kidnappers wanted to release the women in hostage after the ransom.
Men should have been held back as long as the kidnappers had not had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused a position on the report .
The abuse of the stepfather "bringed to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court declared.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested and blessed her before having sexual intercourse, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the eighties, and he returned to life in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead," and that she had "weaned with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
You think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound her and blessed her."
"I didn't molest her sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim who takes his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended in front of the court."
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
"Otherwise she was clearly likely to have been a promising and happy successful young man."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the BBC's Office Secrets Act.
The man was on the move from the Ministry of Defense when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They thought this was handled internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the metropolitan police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that behaved prudently in the rebounding home market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," added Mr. Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as much.
Since the construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk salt 5 penny per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five penny per litre since Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two penny in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Security denied to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many charges of corruption that hangs against her.
The political rival Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, had long been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is planned for the next few weeks but its party, Awami League, has demanded that the temporary government of the country supported by the military the day before total freedom.
The correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you will be able to remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The high court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina, claiming that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical treatment," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall file an appeal against the High Court's order."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's home after October 17 is expected, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was held last year after the government flanked by the military force took over, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Anti-Poly Afghan Campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to violence related to the Taliban, says the UN.
The UN carried out a programme of vaccinations in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the South for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that this is happening despite the promises of the Taliban that would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the decision of the Competition Commission to oblige the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, making it possible for the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB arranged that forcing it to reduce its ITV crash was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticises the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious accusations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or ascertained," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for bad performance.
But later it emerged that the licensed lawyers had not been assessed more late than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against Republican members of the high-profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they can't be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for layoffs, and finally resigned his position.
A number of other officers in the Department of Justice were dismissed.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility for layoffs, which he had abdicated to his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not collaborating with the investigations.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic Bat Out Of Hell inno.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The Coldplays will run the nominations for this year's prizes, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in the standings and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he was forced to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, other merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, looks more like a dusty alley than an active trafficked one.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see her on a normal atlante.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include long-term neighbors who say they were hit by the broken road simply because it was one of the last remains of the noble quarter of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the road, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the Use of the Land of the Town Council of the District, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"We could be the proposals to set it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay a lot of months ago announced that it wants to reopen the small road and install seating positions, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay was buying the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokesperson, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this dead end and turn it into a public threat," he said, adding that the city suggested selling.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical imprint.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps best known as the cover photo set of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The terrain was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, rags of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The book of complaints: A slightly nostalgic look at the extinct city"), published part of a speech about the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an unusually busty, dark, day-old vibe and delimited gates of rusty iron warehouses and windows with the Saracines, with old newspapers of weeks flying along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilely across the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic dress shop.
There were graffiti on the walls and a bottle of 22 ounce empty beer near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-bys said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, dirty and disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not Good As You Think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Attracting Hispanic voters is really a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for English students.
And yet, the issue for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling the learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth-graders, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the higher-level test in the 2008 maths exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of the fourth students did the expert-level test on English-language-art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuses" type.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "we had a great success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you were in class 12 months later you wouldn't be able to figure out what it was."
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools by the Hispanic majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent predicting Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the issue trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these loopholes, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise them or banalize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of the concerns that even the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the crude fell by 7% to $99.80 a barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial unrest, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before going back again, in the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after Congress leaders had said they reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the biggest one in history.
The news was obscured by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from being over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachova Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement "seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, it is expected that the demand for raw materials, including oil, will calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from contagion.
From a perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing down economic growth, reducing forecasts on the price of oil and gas by about 20% for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, the defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a reunion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equalled the grayness of the threatening clouds that overcame them with a toad game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tuning made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people might think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense heavily hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vain launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces Warner's smoke.
The last turn, the smoke forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that ball hold, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe his madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked much more than the second quarter than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a little bit of time."
Rested Gebrselasie surpasses her world record
Haile Gebrselasie of Ethiopia has shown it again because many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking its own record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to race 26.2 miles below 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorably flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselasie sends for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, race last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselasie is developing the 26th world record of such a stunning career that has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from metric mile to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasie jumped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would have worsened her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselasie won Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders like Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes into the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had cramps at her wrists and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was a little criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having overly orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, relying on apripist as if it were a mid-bottom race, and putting world records above the competition sense.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselasie's skills as a marathon.
With the step of four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselasie after the apripists disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselasie made a final impennata to separate from Kwambai, which ended according to 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German national, has completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
You missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but you are healed to win in Berlin, making your best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon you've run.
She ran a race doing good calculations, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as the description in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what is being lost."
Even now, in a year where a so-called black president, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many of us here are no longer aware of the view of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a life-long resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power takeover and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's leadership transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through Florida's often forgotten center into a black-story and human drama scenario
Low as a grant both in life and literature, Hurston brought the readers into the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Outside the road to the left," he wrote, "it is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking that he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits into the transit rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalizes by quoting men singing rough songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was raining in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a Chevrolt triumphant, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others stood by.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, rocking on his chair on the patio on the back above the Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although he was once a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb without a plaque in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western boundary of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in his history.
The forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mixing led to hatred on the community's home door.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed once.
They threw a cocomero out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made to the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, depletes Eatonville's cohesion and endangers the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Natiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, it added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You weren't hugging your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," Mrs. Natiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcome prejudice, as he did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long way to the unmarked tomb of the Hurston and began to struggle for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had again caught the lights of the tip.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a lifesaver.
The community began designing in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the road.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what would say high speed, a true pride for the city," said Ms. Natiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image that the city has of itself.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(It is 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the murals on the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a faint for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
The young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston see his whole race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and fair, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he may need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a pretty city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were kept away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nestled above their heads bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
The drivers shake metal trolleys for the through the pavements, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums, carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretch shirts hanging on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask directions for the large Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks from places where commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island, are making.
They have taken the money from the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say to treat customers as family members.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachow, with deposits of $440 billion in savings, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, frightened by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more bails on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her emaciated CEO Dick Furd in all familiarity, as if yawning a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed port, almost fifty-one of my condo, has changed the subject with respect to our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my shopping.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "I have all my savings in market funds!"
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Moslem tombs desecrated while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islam" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like those road representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the far-right political parties won much at the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits traced with the Jewish spray symbols like David's Star over some tombs, but detectives think it might have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "profoundly shocked" by the news of desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right-hand turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Austrian Alliance for the Future, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the sails and the burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, implying that they are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that change was predominantly carried out by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Traveling abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the rock glamour star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain through France.
The international travel ban was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after he had provided the magistrates with proof of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford preture in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "Thursday, September 25th at Ashford, the Kent police made a request to prevent Mr.Paul Gadd's foreign trip to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted sex offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day warning on his expected departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
The Kent police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A spokesman for the Kent police said: "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of the Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for registered sex offences in the country in order to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two 10- and 11-year-olds.
When Glitter arrived he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have passed it to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for an order to put him in the register of convicted sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having possessed images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"Photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor flying nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don't have to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of the flamenco, picking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the Flamenco Photography Month program, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day ever more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it may also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to transmit passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To grasp the personality of these great ones, you don't need to take them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personalities of the flamenco's greats."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long path in 1997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a sheet camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, conferring to the modern photo, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, capable of conquering the public with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, have been and have been the constant of this work, in exposure these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are featured in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of the flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "PortART project portraits of veteran athletes".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to draw people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You meet or meet people, characters you sometimes don't even know or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concreteize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "hazard"
It is set up in places that still do not know and it deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is taking on a new project that he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project that he is dealing with today "is a gambler" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it equally and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his presentation at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of Acqueduto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as prognostica, the figure of emphasis at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of the Hay Festival to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the places of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has found himself in front of an audience to whom time has flown when the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with great doses of humor, has evoked as he was born the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasing to read" and "living beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to beg for the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous remaking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis upon which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "has effects" and that "makes people more anticonformist." He therefore invited writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their own vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that were supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bulls selected for the races had verified that the conditions of the ground of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather struck against this Festival, preventing the celebration of two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second round of bulls from taking place.
The signs included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and bringing out in triumph, after he had towed with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talvante completed his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than due to the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned himself the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand pounds of hashish exceeds the place of blockade in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers call the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they escape.
The officers sent the tally to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they escaped.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After being chased, the officers manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A.A.J., according to the statement of the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were performing a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the town of Armiñón.
They began to stop a truck for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, speeded up sharply and overrun the place of blockade.
The officers followed up until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants escaped into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents were then able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
The hashish panets, which were in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the registration had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that in the truck's documentation, the arrest was also charged with the offence of forgery of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the provenance of the drug seized.
Detainee A. A. J., aged 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge within the next few hours.
Arrested the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, according to what was revealed in the magazine People by a spokesman for the Californian road.
The witness specified that around 4.30 pm the Locklear "scrambled the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuvers forward and back. Backward, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because "she was worried about the life of Locklear."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"It seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led him to a specialized center for the use of drugs and alcohol to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has proven collaborative and the hypothesis of alcohol excess has been discarded from the beginning, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe the Locklear was under the effect of some medication."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some substance not best specified and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, the Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being admitted after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned the resignation last week following the charge of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said in connection with the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been a consultant to date on the Seville Council.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
He also stressed that training is regulated by "very rigorous ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de mayo", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci in Sangre de May proposes the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría in charge of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims that he had realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Madrid Community three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd of May. The director had agreed to the fact that the story was based on the novel Episodes Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated for the whole of the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "one opportunity" to recreate the proper scenes and customs to portray a "stunned Spain which mistaken the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led to the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" Garci observed.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantoms de Goya - more than twice as much as in Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some scenes planned by the stage that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Return to the beginning, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with which he often uses to try before turning with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de May, try in front of their car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate at Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent this year Spain at the Academy of Hollywood - his Sangre de Mayo, Seven tables de billlar French and, the last selected Los girresoles blinds - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this movie Garci does not expect prizes.
"At first you think you're working for posters, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you agree to simply turn one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillen dancer pays tribute to another Sevillen dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three years he moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this character.
She supports the dancer: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his performances, as she does in "The Open Door"; and that of Maester Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been his student.
"Matilde plays Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honoured about it."
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song by Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive all round, and who have always had many spassimants."
In some ways, this woman's life is also present in distant places, particularly at that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you, because I think it is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and even less considers its work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will start today, at 8.30 p.m. at Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poete neonado" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first edition of the "Diario de un Poete Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Councillor for the Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel museum house and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel Chopo de Luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillor for the Culture of the Junta of Andalusia acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado", curated by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the diffusion of the figure and the work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is that of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the shocking idea that Newman left.
And yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what you try goes beyond any expression, and I now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country could be better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
A father of film and country died at a particularly dark moment, because of the fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, in the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against the drug created in honour of the dead firstborn of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
Everyone gives to a country where it has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without care of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, observed that a man is not dead, an era is over.
Another English man, Sam Mendes, a prized director with Oscar, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high-level example for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today is trying to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for righteousness and having a serious and distant private life in the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful, although he certainly did not lack the opportunity to be unmarried.
"Why do I go out to eat burgers today, if I have a steak in my house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, eager grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect ride", but in my opinion it was by far the worst one I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which would be totally negative if they were then taken into account at the evaluation stage and I had to examine them.
But let's go orderly and start from the beginning.
The foolishness began with the retreat of the dorsal, which assumed that it would go before.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, that's to take everything away (including the chip to avoid the queues during the race).
No, it's not.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first foolishness, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they only had sized S t-shirts (second foolishness, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like that are inept compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to get the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, for the most part, you had to deposit the backpack.
The waiting period lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was foreseeable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once it succeeded in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not be in the right order even because of the chip that, I suppose, will not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will not fit into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about an Olympic city well-prepared.
Microsoft search for receptionist (virtual)
At the MlT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented a new system of recognition of human image and interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group people in conversation groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group with which he is talking and that he is not an employee of society.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells them she'll be at your disposal shortly.
It's all without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week there was a lot of talk about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is welcome.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we daily spend more time browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What are half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its on-line services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and here I give a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the drinks machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a network search.
Last week, moreover, we confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch jointly Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
La Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso brought her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was shining in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangue', as well as Al Pacino ne 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the uniform typical of the Musculous Gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the forcuit with pointed muffins that lifts the weights in the travelling circus.
In essence, this is the typical men's shirt, with cotton inside, strapped and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although, the Belgian Fabulous Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels with respect to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the T-shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels from the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive frame and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian firm does not only concern the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The big resemblance to her sister did not stop her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters have taken their new activities very seriously in the field of fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango has made of its new home, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and timid, he conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movie from the '50s and '60s, from here we derive various inspirations.
Then, I love to lose myself in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe so, even if at the end of the day everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
As a child, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to frown in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better than going to the playground.
Then, once I was a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lessons and essays, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they hand you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
But no.
Never feel better. I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological watch doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me and I also want to be a young mom, that I don't want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting for some films to be filmed last year in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them to step out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to come out of "The Last Hour" and "In search of the Tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago you debuted on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you were in the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, has called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we have exhibited – I have brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – have been auctioned to raise funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I know her for a long time, I can confirm that I am not that true.
Besides, I'm seeing this good part where you're involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pin, I would have done it equally.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't back off.
Relapsed alcoholic drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, to install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a drunken state or if it does not blow into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Procurator-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Seguridad dell'Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once to drive in a state of drunkenness then return to drive the car.
Alcoholck would avoid it, because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the rate of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the car from moving if the driver does not blow, or when a concentration of alcohol higher than that allowed is detected.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the prisoner.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices reduce up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: curbing these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in certain industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 17.40 p.m., the second program, the Spanish plane traveling the principles of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced them to use their hand as a visor to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I asked a taxi driver, on the road, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport crushed at the red carpet and the military cordon consisting of 27 marine soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, nailed to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the hotel door where they live, one of the biggest four in the city, they are greeted by a spirited reporter of Mexican television.
The Best Award Offered by Fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite stylist and bont vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botó-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from emotion.
On the other hand, it is the second large company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, together with the desire of pleasure to the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvas, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making of necessity virtue, due to the brother's recent death, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to remove the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy nearly two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honours of the house and knight which he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because they had both given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in trousers and shirts – drawn by her hand – turned into a dinner, wearing a long, sensual black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, recalling other times, seized a bar and sketched out a "great plies".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the building's premises, but had previously shown us his son's photos on his cell phone.
The next day we were pleased to see Olivier Martinez – another boy moving on his motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and had previously made sure that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number of stress stress
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The awakening is almost a punishment when it breaks every morning at 7, but it is still worse to imagine themselves involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one and not two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the effort to get out of the world of work.
No, this number is nothing more than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, a whole "menu" of tailor-made options for everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relations, this "manual" denies this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Speak in sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very nervously to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak while being asleep.
The first time that happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn't really matter.
This is a benign alteration of sleep defined as sleepiness.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have said that you have spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (piping in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is still a little studied phenomenon.
Even the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite occurs (scream, shout, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly a specialist should be consulted to see if there is any question that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a source of the situation.
We have said that this is benign alteration, therefore, there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. if coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, on the other hand, is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcit the child before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once sleepy eyes appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping, so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency you better consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety comes from in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming of saying it, so you have to pay great attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask questions at night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like that causes a huge anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory in the house after a long, fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the largest number of networking opportunities, turning one into the victory of the game.
The rhythm was not much sustained during this meeting when the attackers expressed themselves hard.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who struck the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Founderflick from a distance, then Hirn High, Romain from the point and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the camp, leaving only the sparked Riahi in the point of attack.
The beginning of the second period was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But Illhaeusern's gunner will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie won't be able to take advantage of it and won't put great trouble at the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just in order to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of play when, after a rocky action, the ball slammed the cross.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
In view of the demonstration of the fishermen who brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning, in the Department of Finistère, to enchant the representatives.
The latter have promised to accept it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "they will present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the impennate price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president will "discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the working conditions and pay of sailors".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snap operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections with Belle-Isle have not been interrupted.
On the island of Quiberon was implemented a roadblock.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking to feet demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended towards the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the vessels remained at the pier, or at Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantica, stopped in the evening the block of the note refinery Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday in the ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will in fact decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give in" et "they do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Committee for Fisheries.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the limit of yield of a boat is reached only with a diesel less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the film and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer's company this year counts 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession that affect the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company trusts widely in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
So far, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of the life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to divest include the subsidiary of leasing International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities rely on 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting History
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historical collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson Plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, that is, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, at the bottom of 777,68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected refusal of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, representatives refused the funding required by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two republicans out of three rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were indeed dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the American central bank, ndr) and the other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit the conditions of credit," said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economy at the Global Insight.
And highlighting its state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the Wachovia banking activities by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the UK banks, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year bond yield is down to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year bond yield is 4,161%, compared with 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama to the advantage of the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, e.g. a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the headquarters of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the TV duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls by the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday grants a five-point advantage to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters, found that 39% of them think Obama the winner, while 25% point at McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"Undervaluing her would be a mistake.
It has a good purpose," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the "indeedness" of the opponent with regard to the issues discussed during the first face to face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he has often told multiple shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," she assured.
What has been a continuing target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has been concise and precise.
It has promoted its readiness to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama", this weekend, he fought back a democratic spot, repugnant the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a beating rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers."The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," he considered yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that shown by Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's riots, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Prudencefully, the two candidates avoided the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the polling stations in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what purpose? They will not do what they want, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that this regime which has been a good figure before the foreign observers in order to resume in dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Penalties, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of property, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We were distanced from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the voting process," said Jouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of facade, stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we are not going to reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the ballot.
He stressed that participation quotas seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) had given way to every kind of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asked the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient to power."
Night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
Meeting - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as the Héma-Québec has become one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, seriously shocked by the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, in February 1994 the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee to design a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still have confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood sampling and field research over the next few years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary is convinced, however, that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle since its inception on 28 September 1998.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, tells the one who has been the president since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
Thus, one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelinau reports was that when there are doubts and there could be a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique appeared on the market for the detection of HIV: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) which allowed the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not of antibodies against it, on which instead the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, since the person has contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and thus not being able to detect them has thus diminished considerably.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes every year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples, it takes more than 24 years before a case of HIV is found with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Being the most aggressive cancer cure, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Cases of penury are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frantic that there is hardly an hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec distributes not only blood samples but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball and skin heart valves that are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Hema-Quebec that manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in the bank of our thousandth champion of cordon blood and we plan to take more than a thousand of them every year.
You should begin to propose them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't have access to them," as Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in Semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinals of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter finals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Campgroundist Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goal on both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino scored the successive networks for Montreal.
For Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first round of the round, Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinals.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed on the day.
In brief - Decisive Network of Kovalev
The Canadian and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game stage winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two steps, and picked up a passage for the victory, in the fourth of the Habs's prep games.
It decided to win the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian has warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to get rid of the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There's been a good ovation."
North point Charest
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the Liberal Party's General Council, Jean Charest arrived yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to get elected during the partial elections today.
"To widen the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented to Levis yesterday, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of image mill.
On three maxi screens, there were some spectacular negative hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like in the middle of the electoral campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- the northern territory to the 49th parallel- had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but he did not say about timing or investment quotas, as he did not explain what will be the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
Most of all, it has only pointed out what it considers to be a priority position: hydro-electricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced several improvements.
According to the list drawn by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory twice as much as France", is here, is Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as he wants to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
"It is traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
In other words, "In view of climate change, we must re-evaluate the North," he said about the transition from north to west, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of ices.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty.’
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Hungarian PQ), have already given way to the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) occupies an important position, began work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting," not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also fall within the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as leader of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to reiterate Centrale Beauharnois in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that nationalized hydro electricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference, conservative this time, was made to John Diefenbaker's "Strade to the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Alongside the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, arousing applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not reject the possibility of voting in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He points out that he is certainly very committed, particularly in a mission of the federal council in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend has provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the Northern Plan has been sceptically accepted.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, re-polluted Quebec's Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had," we would have progressed today," commented Marois next to Jean-Talon's candidate (a scrutiny today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all of this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, a substitute for Mario Dumont, back today from vacation.
Letter - A disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (irony of luck) of the Harper cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "disgrace" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves our full admiration says much about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated a citizen of its own in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldiers rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
For information purposes, we recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadraffin to be subject to a regular process in Canada.
It is proper for the same government to close its eyes to torture: it is very important to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop bragging and that sounds so foolish about his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no morals anymore: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today minority (see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party preaching Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame is right here, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Barrick Gold Speech
In the 17 September edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest auriferous company has carried out a defamation quarrel of six million against three authors and a small digital publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation quarrel, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his.
Little matters the outcome of the process, writers and editors of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a large amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decisively odd weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically bottomless of the mining company.
Moreover, in these odd-armed struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that embodies the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to speak on the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that he should have presented his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place with the exchange of views and not with manganese blows.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misrepresents the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate when his contempt for the same public is clear?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word only indicates the lawyers who are fragrantly paid and not the whole Canadian; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Black Canada does so first because it refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of embalming (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of the Black Canada an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the quarrel carried out by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on university research freedom and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss issues of discomfort to the richest companies in the world, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit abusive complaints.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic army, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest saving-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollars plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been taking place for months on Wall Street, still needs to be ratified by the two Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its actual implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of pinned houses for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," explained the democrat.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, priceless discomfort and turmoil would have spilled over to the daily lives of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed deadline corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Following the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidency were rather in favour of the agreement, however, without avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama is worthy of having added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will allow the owners to maintain their home and that inherent in salaries for managers of companies covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyse the details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read, it's something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move on."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to regain with taxpayers' money the doubts, the riskable and unsoldable assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (monetary) and then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the slowdown of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to air the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than acquired.
In order to come to everyone, to Congress, a provision has been added that, if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to be added to another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will obtain shares in the protected companies that will pay it dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to resell when the waters calm down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for lending and to set limits on remuneration and initial compensation paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given a free way.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the draft, both in the Republican and democratic armies.
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, said to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not take advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at the Congress nicknamed "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hastily conclusions and to examine carefully the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would renounce the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and the right to vote are levied on banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families now appreciate that times are uncertain"
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in a bilateral for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans currently being made at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that she will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty with blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a sickening smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a strength!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was long a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last quality mark.
Because in him there was recognition of a whole country invaded by the safe made man, the combatants of the war of the Pacific, proud in the fight, which at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, on television and soon at the cinema.
That same civil rights activist man was also the motorist driver who classified himself according to Mans' 24 hours in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of a secret, discreet, committed star go away with him, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which the mystery will never be fully revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart dive for cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is reproposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's fascinating cowboy(1969) and that boy unable to wish his wife the foci (Elizabeth Taylor) in La cat on the roof that burns adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the shoes of sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not maintain what he promised.
Many other Paul Newman have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassù loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That funny villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in the Lo Spaccone, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was his.
Still him.
The epochs happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, Coen brothers.
The circle closed with one last role as godfather of the Irish mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the greatest legends of the cinema that soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its sparrows, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, called him, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying," judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic carogne or desperate, of which he expressed bano and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudding sensitivity.
The first time of Jennifer, 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, traced a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless rainy tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old friend of arms Robert Redford (they had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness" His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift, is turned off.
We will have torn his face apart on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, though born as gag.
However, the revenues of those sales were destined to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of hiding on his myth, chose to engage until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And also privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
A model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced at the Zuschlag invoice factory & members?
In the near future, on 8 October, the trial will be discussed against János Zuchlag and his associates.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of an association of criminals that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Procura the money obtained from competitive calls, it was used by them for private purposes, and have often certified the carrying out of the activities by false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million guilders, ended in part in the boxes of the organization Fiat Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from competitive calls based on invoices for non-existent transactions and associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, instead circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices for consumption, on the model of these then were prepared the invoices to be forwarded to the competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Žri, who, according to our information, has drawn up the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuchlag and members in 2003, the catering site provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurant, would not all enter the place together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, a bus of formal errors and content.
A Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay, but in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of invoices full of fantasy have exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even include documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, director of the company, said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned to purchase and showed his invoices, he immediately realized that these were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and match Iva of our company were in a wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons he did not even return the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were housed, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many sleeping places.
In addition the invoice was catering and their restaurant is no longer in function for a long time.
The assiduous manufacturers of invoices did not worry to inform themselves that the travel agency of Budapest of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips in Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the survey, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travelling to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the Iva to 15% and not 25% as shown on the invoices, also the employees of the hotel only issued invoices printed, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a firm have indicated as activity carried out the carriage of goods by road, as is known from the procedure of the Public Prosecutor, activities that were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, due to formal defects - it causes non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that invoices issued in favor of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had lunched you a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They've issued bills knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of having to issue fancy invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice on request from Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favor of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the accused, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million guilders to the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlas Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money because the prepared invoices were then extorted, but the associations forgot to make this appear in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those which are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to contact the Delta Trió Kft Director General, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company released several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director General of this firm was a Romanian to which Ivan Kubatov would have submitted the documents concerning the firm between 2002 and 2005.
As far as Kubatov is concerned, during the investigation, he acknowledged that he had released invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies was operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies made it useful because, at the request of the co-computed lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuchlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In the name of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov released to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The defendant considers that Kubatov has stashed 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fancy invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition call.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban on the utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
For this not to come to a rooster, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received by the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in demand, will probably report on the trend in the production of the invoices.
However the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuchlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised several times to talk about everything in an extended way, he has not yet done so.
You have to see if it's in your interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusa, who - in exchange for a 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for now could also have offended himself because his requests for the relief of his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have not so far been fulfilled.
While the authors of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
At auction, buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and researchers economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study on the journal Science men do not want to stay back in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay even a higher price.
The research attempted to trace the nervous pattern of this "partita" at the level of the nervous system through experimental axes.
A group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while with the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the game of auction, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body striated under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise of the price is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, economists of the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost their money in the event of an auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was stressed, while for the other the loss.
By checking the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher stakes of the control group or "winner".
"These results cannot be deduced from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These so far explained the phenomena found in auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of neurologic image creation have helped to solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, whereas chronic liver diseases are mentioned in Hungary as the leading causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are cared for: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
Vaccination against the A and B virus is useful for travellers, against the C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not cured it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because the pathogens subdolely destroy the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is worth talking to your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, thus ceases the infectious power and can be prevented from the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a species of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment, examining how godly faith affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the context of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out with 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of studies in which in addition to academics also take part scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University.
The test was carried out exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the XVII century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the herd of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the XV century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and believed it to have a tranquillizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time slot received 20 electroshock in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious theme painting or the other.
Catholics have reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "someone took care of" them and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious theme image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
"We have to look for an image where they have very positive feelings, like a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the search result.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results the question remains only if the believers are presented with the painting of a brick by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the tenth birthday day Google can claim to be in the pockets of people as well as in the sky over their heads; it knows where they spent the holidays, which clinic they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company is not enough yet.
However, what concerns sceptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "let's put all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google's director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
At the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but the software can't answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their searches on the internet exactly the words sought are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page they stop after the search.
Through the Customized Search started two years ago users a e.g. can memorize their browsing history, can relate to what they have looked for and clicked on, these then for a long time will generate results to a much better extent; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - they ask concerned users about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the oppositions of the interned are caused by the fear of fear of the potential power represented by the firm, not by the sense of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even the rebellion to power.
A fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the interned.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded information to the Brazilian government that made possible the identification of pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
The interns concerned about personal rights instead have sighed from relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the association of electronic legal protection EFF - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even then you cannot force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped out nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained with reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the individual user search lists and the entire list of websites and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data spherk Google because they believe that in this way their intimate sphere and private life will be attacked by beginning to use its services and rise up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users who appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, however both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the constantly updated source code and the package of programs is much more accessible, young and cooler than the official practice of colossal software.
But it can also happen because the geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the repeated keywords more often in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 only speaks of collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communicative channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of which can be inserted in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which its most recent photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read about many exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common round of friends, comes to know easily with those who spent the night his perfect boy or a firm can fire an employee because she has written a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is certain, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make a way to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google’s monopoly can do it (e.g. by starting with Scroogle using Google’s search system but at the same time it does not leave traces voluntarily).
There are few people who do not register on purpose on community pages for not being found, Google's online applications, from writing texts to image management and gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far existing.
Public opinion does not expect so much in secret as the time when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its $156 billion worth is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, services introduced in record-time instead cause major malaise not only to Microsoft but also to numerous companies of software development.
However, critical observers alongside all this find some alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely refused the employee protest after doubling the company's asylum line, has considered it too expensive to have the repeated daily catering of employees, but this all goes down in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has chipped the head of the Chinese government and in accordance with their agreement the firm will filter out all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the firm seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world into one point: while some consider that the Google book and magazine scanning and storage project will assume such proportions that the firm will soon be faced with the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic data base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped the double murder of Ózd to make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected to have helped to remove the traces of the crime - said Tuesday the spokesman for the Borsod Region Police Questura.
The young people have admitted the crime to them accused, they are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on foot free.
The favor is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man in the place, was put in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated murder for profit.
From the survey it turned out that the twenty-three-year-old had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off the debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a yard in Ózd where he and his 9-year-old daughter killed.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal was the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of the use with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to purchase the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the Stock Exchange stock in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its shares.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the offer of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Estate with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis are already talking about "one second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has taken place thanks to the American President - accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a law upset in a hurry, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11th.
Also a part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy at the edge of the coffin.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing and will suffer from it all over the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to abandon the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to navigating financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then the financial resources and new solutions will no longer be sufficient.
In the long term, Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
Only Monday the weakened financial institutions have obtained more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the hopes that European taxpayers, like the Americans, too, will have to use their portfolio to remedy the crisis seem more real.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "saviors" must not immediately defuse the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they established in which case taxpayers' money should be tapped to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the calabrone flight
What could be the best method to develop anti-contrast technologies if not to mimic the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the Calabrians gave the initial strategic insight to the Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-auto equipped with bees properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form a personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exposure Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the bee view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have drawn on the laser telemetric idea to copy the function of the bee view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If it weren't for this, the auto robot wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory Mobility and the auto robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, in which the collision is now considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eye beater.
But unlike bees, the deviation can't go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to the bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than those of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantity of intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
You don't need a memory of gigabyte or megabyte.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, provided for by Nissan, can be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Additional application possibilities can be represented by the unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive baby.
The written version of the $700 billion Economic Savings Act for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to the schedule of the eastern coast, the leaders of the congress decided the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken some serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of American Representatives that she has only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan's compromise.
The minister of the Treasury Henry Paulson speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: the program will work and it will be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi it is not the rescue of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic cart.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 o'clock in Washington (on Monday night 2 o'clock in Central Europe), but did not bring a great increase in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 draft Economic Stabilization Act on the Programme, after which it will be in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night with the Pelosi, then joyfully welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesman for the White House.
However, the program differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which predicted that the 700 billion dollars would all be spent on buying securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step, half of the sum of $700 billion can be spent, $250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with which the Treasury Ministry will purchase securities with disproportionate credits behind them, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will decide the President.
A special college will control the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "advenated" claims.
Purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced the department's powers.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested companies to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means that give rise to concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damage.
Henz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to arrive at the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to find ourselves ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as parachutes of gold.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will provide the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose an overrun on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the deceased bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will act aggressively to ensure that directors' money is not exaggerated.
In addition, the existing contracts of the parachute of gold will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of directors generals - said the measure the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the Committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition to this, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will stand up again.
The bill includes that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal which provides for how to return to taxpayers the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.

National industrial sales prices compared to the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
National sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimum by 0.1% compared to July.
The increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoes processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high level of the price of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemical sector.
A decrease in prices in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in the woodworking sector (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the field of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the gas price carried out by the authorities on 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the manufacturing industry, the biggest increases were in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metals products, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, representing a significant weight.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production sectors of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement might enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that the overseas seat is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be the entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The Hungarian diplomat will continue the negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order of the Order of the Hungarian Republic Cross with the Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisors of the Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed Sunday their support for the $700 billion government plan for bailing out the banks, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for the release of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls with the focus on economic issues Obama again recovered a little bit of advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin's vice president, was dispersed.
Obama in a speech at Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He pointed out that the proposal contains those consumer protection passages which were supported by him too.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself get away with defining past McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that "all we will send down this situation with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a way to go."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a monitoring committee of the finance minister and the limitation of top managers' good outcomes, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not have a prominent role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
German-language world press review
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-conscious - so analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents to analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist the erosion of the CSU has already begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
Christian-socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process ended that exactly ten years ago was feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state is over.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated at 47.7%, for the first time below the 50th threshold.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the subsequent modernization in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists have already predicted it 40 years ago, but they have very wrong the time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Germans of the East and the North in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the fidelity of the electors to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the free professionals, craftsmen, diplomats and graduates.
Here CSU support has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are blocked in coalition matters" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions; the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were held, now it rotates all around the coalition; in the discussion transmitted by the public TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to deal with ÖVP.
The SPÖ aims to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as vice-cancellaire.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
Repeating this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted prudently to red tenders.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get into ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, questions should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ has repeated being open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition we are ready to assume responsibility for governing" - said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, organized this year by France with the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the Congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities opened the conference to the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations in equal opportunities.
Mr Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that the Roma are extolled from the labour market in the first place because of their low enrolment.
"Most Roma young people do not have the title of middle-level study and as a consequence of elementary teaching of poor quality only a small number of them can achieve a higher degree of study."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more widely known in the field of Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, as the school begins a Roma, the more it grows its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes paid for the income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and secret schools" - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of the European Union's aim and action is necessary to speed up the processes of school segregation, and that is why it is essential to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be halted, Roma children must be given the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens fully to the future of Europe," asked Járóka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, from the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: piety for a transitional period
At the end of October we will decide the fate of the implaced Huber-Beckstein couple.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, at the tops of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal matters has been postponed for the time being.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their place, the question is as long as mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem who suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case made known that they are not attached to the chair with all their forces.
They have thus tried to soften the angry subscribers of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the "Bavarese tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union obtained 60.7%, now after the coup d'état against Stoiber, they dropped to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria, which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coalition in any way.
As the first signal of the reorganisation within the party the vice-president and federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the restricted exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Electors exhibiting right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriel Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as opportunities of blow by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber, who has been plotting in the shadows, will also play an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on September 28th the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be a chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the CSU's land loss will not negatively impact the great coalition in Berlin.
What is certainly related: it will not be easy to manage the CSU injured, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) but it is explained by the mistakes made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been devoid of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, with a presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections held in circumstances, would "allow" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus waived a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which requested a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter into the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
He referred to a distension that the OSCE assessing the election campaign has placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's rapid Monday report, however, also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this the opposition has seen an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk has also arranged for a small confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month already.
We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - it has told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "the power has been afraid to even bring one opponent into a no-weight Parliament".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions for the results, but instead tries to send voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said referring to the fact that even the most officially aided city, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that social security "remembers sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States said to the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure against the sneakers, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar at work time.
The new antifannolloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" says the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism", stresses Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of swivel doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
I mean, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and cornetto.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for public employees' illness have decreased by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - over the last 8-10 years have been doubles compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the rules of Brunetta decree by adhering to the Codacons' support.
"While the Minister of Public Service has today released numbers about the least absenteeism at work for causes of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operable fannullons' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands in Italy the employees of the right and productive public administration who have united to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree".
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatment for dependent infirmity due to service; the extension of the hourly periods of availability of the sick worker, within which the inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Cerial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, data Inail confirms that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures testifying to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the tragic same chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalids of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "live appreciation for the continued association's commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of unfortunate workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"It was, of course, a 'bad' outraged, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant are the many initiatives promoted in the school setting for a more direct awareness of the young people who look to the world of work.
Attention should be paid to the phenomenon, not to dwell on the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and to improve legislation.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a firm commitment to put you to an urgent end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not remove that the number of white deaths is still impressive," noted the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"In fact, we would not want this "reduction" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that in general too little is done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school".
"It needs further effort - it has added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But, above all, it needs a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "care trail to which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are fortunate should not depend on spontaneousisms or lengthening from time to time laid down by the legislator".
Mp3 readers under accusation, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission says, which, in a statement issued in Brussels, mentions the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Emerging and Recently Identifyed Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day holding the high volume device risk a permanent loss of auditory capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who use portable music and mobile phones at high sound levels with frequency can unmistakably damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Gives scientific evidence - continues the responsible EU - emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and take the step with new technology."
Brussels had asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken in order to better protect children and adolescents from noise from portable musical devices and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard which limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are increasing as to the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to these sources of noise.
It is possible to limit this much by using solutions such as the reduction of noise levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would concern 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June it will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which settled this morning at its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
After closing in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bollino" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all the political, social and cultural ideas - it wishes to emphasise German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome which the political decision-makers, which remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, given that its opinions will not be binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Politics is too often crushed by the management of the daily life and the emergences that sometimes manifest themselves.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary entity nor a wagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that the Capital expresses".
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or still, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it has absolutely needed, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries alone but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to stand alone: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today by private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing just as the date of the election approaches.
He wrote a Miami lady on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, there are attacks that don't say much; there are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? Well, there are polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper of Mississippi, in the slums of the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know well who will give his vote the American patriot.
It comes out on one side of the U.S. mentality covered up to the last.
"Say whatever you want, then we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama is to win, we will go away from America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes made during his term? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq for the majority was the weak point of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
U.S.A., the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in newspapers it is cut-off time. And many give the internet fault, "murder" of the printed paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
Also the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together the newspapers, is a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the general public wants to be substantially replaced.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapers and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open up an internet crossing, for many views as the "murder" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" reported by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "makes something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of the executives at national level are confident that their reporters will divide their values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with "job security".
Executives who think they lose their job within 3 years are at 47% at national level.
For staff reporters, it's 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month as well as pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA RESTAURING GROUND
The president of the second penal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counterpatute investigation concerning Unipol-Bnl climbing.
During the course of his trial last week, he obtained discharge from the residents who were converted into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel from the town of province to a home in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which the pm gave the contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and to gain access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
We have a confirmation from the New York Times yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and the finance world, strong especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, for the record, that became prepotently alive with the vote I was saying at the beginning.
This, however, is just one example of the changes, of the major changes, which the current economic earthquake may well pre-announce or have already shown: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
Both in the USA and in Europe, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time, which in the new climate are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the refurbishment, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, yes, have close links with abroad, but which first of all see the very large size of the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also elected.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems largely out of play or not to have much to say: the overwhelming evidence is given by the European Union, which divides as usual between different interests and between the various state strategies, is unable to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get close it is only the States that own economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things in the sixth place.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which no market and no international organisation can possibly ever have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we noticed from a section that our future will have to deal increasingly with those very immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are nevertheless bound in an absolute way to a restricted space, to a territory.
So that those who are sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, those who are unlucky to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
However, I come to the second novelty that presages a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species, revealed so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discreet, an inoffer, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, it seems to be becoming more and more common in vast sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far at the height, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, to having made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimation of the traditional ruling classes and political assets, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolved" elections or in the sudden changes of the collective moods of these last and most recent times, from the conservative ascent in Austria and Bavaria to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with you).
You have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it more and more difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what has not been taking shape since today in the deep strata of Western societies and that the economic crisis reinvigorates, increases, potentially stirs up to dissipation.
In the face of all this talking about a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The supercollet to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to us.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American Journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves to the legs of the geques, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it is easily detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the engineering faculty of the University of Dayton.
CAMMINARE SUI MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new sticker.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented a microfiber adhesive as self-cleaning hair from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Pharmacists: Never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because of the dissecting and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time to some life-saving medicines alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing depending on the case the efficacy with also serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices are packaged and fresh associated with the taking of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, cancelling its beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic effects some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines.
PHARMACI A RISK - The same Italian drug agency had reported it in a newsletter two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink if they take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit medications.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually intend to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines that you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not make us impress but ask for clarification from your doctor or pharmacist» pointed out the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Zealander who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was addressed to the economist, but that has now turned out to be exact.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great economist", but also a divulger with a style"very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of Bush administration liberism".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the issue of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, with SUN Microsystem monitoring behind them, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: the welcome screen and the magazine interface and made less Spartan, add more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also placed to interoperability with Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which collect the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet one can intervene several ways between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the editor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should release the final result.
The Italian version is available at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English one that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may also be sent home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free will can be a driving-beam for the distribution of houses, it is in the business field that Open Office tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And there are also realities that offer an ideal training, counselling and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the scripting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulet presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected amount.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
The news is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood samples are analysed in the past few weeks from the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and meet the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climbing sweater.
IMMIGRATED:NEW YORK TIMES AND WATCHES, IS ITALY REASONED?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? How much is asked in a long article the New York Times that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support to the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation called for by the League which tightens up the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also referred to as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of rent up to 900 euros for one room
The rent market for university students does not know crisis.
According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point to exclude entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that the families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market to trigger a process of generalized increase also for residents."
In most cases, rent offers then contain a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without fee limits, related sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed which, through the revision of the tax, can ease prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, about 450 euros are needed; for a single room, there is a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) at an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) at a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence one bed place costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, they need 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single bed.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelles and similar areas.
In Naples for one bed there are 300/450 euros, for one room it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, 250/350 euros are needed for one bed, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city's economy.
In the cities where it is more frequent the rental of extra-Community students, as in Perugia, there is also another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested from foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historical halls
Historical cinematic halls close in favor of the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the great Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the large multisales and the consequent death by consumption of the monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inextricable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory, "it is as if less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions", notes the director of New cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago worth to Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the practitioners, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the biggest strike are mainly the salt in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna boasts 82 single cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures be built but we should guarantee the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the workers' fund: the government's pre-debt debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is ethically and morally shameful that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, has decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote single-sala cinemas in both the historical center and the suburbs.
Among the rules provided for are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stopping and in some parking.
"It is an initiative that I like" notes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the multi-x layer, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradise", which I had thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have experienced many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs from the dust I turn to the other side".
Links between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the Commune's choices to the interests of the cosca Piromalli".
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria refer to the mayor and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in the mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer nephew, the same name of the boss, already condemned by association for criminal mafia, condemned to pay compensation 10 million euros.
"In danger of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local authorities had expressed the will to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to enter officially into the municipalities, facilitating the already large possibilities of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized maladivities there are several" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cosque.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council was dissolved but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition, after the dance of May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the municipal council's dissolution.
He called into question the then deputy minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having built everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the cosca Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to match the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group known as near the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy comes from where the bigs come down to the field
It is an exterminated deposit, which occupies over 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they've put their eyes, and now they're trying to put their hands together, collusive like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity requirements could be covered by sea-flicking power plants.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Plus there would be currents and tides.
Colossians on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are increasingly and among these companies have always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the American oil colossus to the economic daily Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Committee, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has started a plan for new upswings.
In addition to Chevron, there is the Verdant Power Inc. in New York and the New Jersey Ocean Power to travel the path of the energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in the details, indicate an interest in ascent by observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about technology still at dawn, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
However, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used to produce energy on a large scale.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boe connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure spins a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants in the way of design, waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could serve for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides spins the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of the tides at this time.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It's just about the energy of the tides that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others facing the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
