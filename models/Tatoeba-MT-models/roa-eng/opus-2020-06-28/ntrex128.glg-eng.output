To the members of the Gales Assembly worry 'that they be taken by monks'
Dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name of the MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate arose because of plans to change the name of the assembly by the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole landscape are afraid to be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was worried that the new name "throws with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "shit" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Paid Cymru party showed that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group had a "mindly open" about the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there was only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the Assembly members will depend on the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed a great deal of support for the designation of the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of AM title, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received most support in a public consultation.
It seems the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the operation of the assembly, such as the rules for the disabling of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should call themselves when they debate legislation.
Macedonians dock in polls in referendum to change country name
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that its neighbour's name represents a claim from his territory and has repeatedly opposed his requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no more with the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin keep silent while the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders I've spoken to said there was a bar and a church in every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or another."
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As far as churches are concerned, he fears that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods still be shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments from these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of those churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took care of the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street stores, a Harlem commercial street that resisted hiring and raising black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the carillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that he was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed him to the biggest carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin's.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the organ that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing her concern that the latter "intends to pass on costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some frigues complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hurts a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing underwater fishing in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the season of that crustacean.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel narrated to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help from screams, when he was swimming with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just thrilling to catch a lobster, but he soon realized that he was shouting "I was wrong!
I've been worked up!'
"Hammel said he noticed when he came to see the boy.
'I'll beat everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'' added Hammel.
The boy was transferred on a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that they had divided a shark into the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to be introduced into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to the department stores full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the beauty market of the United Kingdom, which amounts to £2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and products fall into the home, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then they will pass on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty occurs at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Esseise, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newer customers.
Besides, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened at Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates to buying small amounts of food every day in small shops means supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that establishments will increasingly look like malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's already introduced points of sale from Argos and Habitat into hundreds of shops, as he bought the two chains two years ago, apparently this reinforced the sales of edibles and made the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but an association came to an end after a dispute over how to share the pharmaceutical incomes in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy business of 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was noted to participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that can be used to ask for advice.
Our range of products is designed to meet all the attractive and practical needs and locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby withdraws 11 million pounds of business
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "furious" after the television host Holly Willoughby had withdrawn from a £11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of clothing and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den's star, Peter Jones sparking off his lifestyle mark in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the gold girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had time to dedicate to the brand of home clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones picked up a plane to Britain and went to one of his holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was unlike one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone who participated in the project astonished.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
The experts believe that the abandonment of this morning's presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and textiles to the home, and that it could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are fathers of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation meetings, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host in ITV I'm to Celebrity.
A source near Jones declared last night that "We shouldn't comment on your business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked over the criticisms that he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a president's own little" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by putting on his voice of "telephone presenter."
"I didn't give in to anything."
He indicated that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, that Trump considered a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation have stagnated.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the US's "corresponding response" to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," she said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending the missile tests, helping free the hostages and making the remaining U.S. soldiers go home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about Kim's relationships.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump pointing to the crowd he had just ahead.
A earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, assured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with his help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is extremely ill prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters have been built for tsunamis, it is not usual to find them in other backs.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, travelling among many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will be on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the new calamity to come.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign turned around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and made money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line of re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, who use machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Player from Liverpool Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of draw in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League at Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's marina with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before he shot the second stick.
The balloon flew over the area as it moved towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling on a Arrizabalaga Kepa jumping into the air and entering the net.
"Just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and gave a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard had scored in minute 25.
The Blues front passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning around half-change and running into the Liverpool field..
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful step in depth driving Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second stick marking a bullet with the leftist shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
The Liverpool is facing Naples at the Champions Group Stage, League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadium San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will make her own videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of fatalities of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to which the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would get trapped in the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to a press conference the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had died of a knife
A murder investigation opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and she arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is in its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to get anyone in touch with us who was near John Street at Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera in the command board who will contact us, as they may have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a nearby Birkenhead and found himself inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she found herself that morning.
The investigation continues while the police claim to be in the process of informing the nearest family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his apartment, but the police have informed him that they can't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
The residents have just learned that they won't be able to reenter within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying on the scene.
It doesn't stop saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cord with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who anonymously contacts Crimestoppers on the phone number 0800 555 111 citing the September 30, 247 log.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
Their prohibition would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by their fanatical and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion of "fire" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrongly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the opinion that exists in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament for foreign pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the object of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict in the mid 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A pig killer smashes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified solely by his last name, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a courtyard in the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A porcine herd prepares to put the vaccines to the pigs in a courtroom on May 30th and May 2005 in China, Qinghai province, China.
Apparently she'd traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from Yunnan's neighboring province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to another adjacent courtyard.
He said there was a big male in the courtyard with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had bloody and broken legs," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kilos ran into a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
We just have to have the respect they need," she said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The predictions indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakened as cold waters over the north coast of Mexico overflight.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, east time, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometres from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is hoped that Rosa will advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a waltz begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Low California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start pushing tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valgate will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest expect 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with conditions in deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under tropical rain threat.
The strong rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and electrical storms will bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The waltz will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of minor debris and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains from the wet season in the region.
Disperse tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Plenty rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this implies significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the U.S.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country is expected a warm October beginning, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which makes up about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures exceeding the average for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the jails interrupt their usual programming for a late Friday news: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that he's 100 for sure that Kavanaugh played his heels drunk and tried to take his clothes out at a high school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company reported the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other transmission chains, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's a similar audience to a football final or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on television Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that it would vote for Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by protesters trying to get into an elevator on the way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stared down for a few minutes while he was filmed, live on CNN.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, "You have the power while there are many helpless women."
Flake said his office made a statement before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable stations broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the entire Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI were investigating allegations against the appointee next week, which called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an inquiry into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect oranges from the other side was "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims murdered: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspected of the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect for shooting the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, Louisiana State University.
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The officers broadcast the video of the match between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed that they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliate channel, WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was bailed for $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge parish coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department has eluded the fugitive unit from Louisiana state police, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police are neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement for his "diligence and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer, Will Wade, said the team was "stunned" and "stunned" by Wayde's passing.
"That's what worries us all the time," Wade said.
Grey red volcano about Mexico City
The ashes that the Volcano Popocatepetl throws into the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after they had detected activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several storms and tremors.
The images of social networks showed thin layers of gray in the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers south of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 had shaken the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Coping between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the riot police and while thousands joined the rival protests to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked proseparatists who were being masked by riot police cast eggs and powder painting that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that used to be crowded with tourists.
There were also colds later that day with the police, who used the bitches to hold the fight.
For several hours, pro-independent groups who co-authored "Ni olvido ni perdono", faced unionist protesters shouting "Larga vida a España".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by mild wounds received at the protest, according to the local press.
Tension continues the flower of skin in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although participation was low and the opposites to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop voting at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also happened, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independentist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had the hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy when we can vote, but now we're busy," he said.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, albeit decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independent Catalan parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their most known leaders in a self-imposed exile or arrested awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more tension every time," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year he would run for election to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrest a man after a car crashed into a house
three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had fired on several occasions at a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (Summer Times in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the gate and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a plague had been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Ascended Livingston surprised Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to raise a level by placing themselves after the Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still uncanned out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they're facing the leader, Hearts, from what separates them eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still invincible in the division for the sixth consecutive match; the main trainer, Holt, has not known defeat since he had replaced Kenny Miler the past me.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team must've moved on long before the time they scored, because with their control they've caused the Rangers all sorts of trouble.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his crossfire did not cross the doorway; then, the shot of Alan Lithgow came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the doorway.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the standing ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston held a loot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who played the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but had encountered an impenetrable defense that avoided much work on the Liam Kelly ranger.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
The Rangers' garrison, Allan McGregor, took a shot at Scott Pittman with his weight, and Lithgow sent the ball out of another shot at Livingston's standing ball.
There were many crossovers in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and the other by Halkett's entry to his replacement Glenn Middleton.
Livingston's 'phoenonal': analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from stadium Tony Macaroni
A great performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimous, they were excellent and still surpassing expectations in their upward trajectory.
His game style and players have only changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt's by the way he pushed the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath all over the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well sometimes under Gerard's command, on this occasion they didn't reach that level.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, all of a warning call for the Rangers, found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which intends to resolve the relations between NATO allies.
They differed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city congregates the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before an acclaimed visitor as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies while colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street passed from Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 hours (summer hours in Britain).
The car driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the act.
The accident takes place months after another cyclist dies in a leaking run-in at Childers Street just over a mile and a half from the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police showed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street locks and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers were injured in the riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m. (Summer hours in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Return" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for mild lesions in the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said, "You have deployed staff from specially trained prisons to face a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officers had to go to jail to calm down a riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the drought-affected places could benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it's very likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwestern Desert, leaving the possibility of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to south and east Nevada, south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly on Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
Phoenix's National Meteorological Service reported in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre radio station in Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a 60-mile radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Weather Service foresee 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in Arizona's Mogolon Bordo.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible isolated totals of 100 l/m2.
For those out of danger of sudden floods, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, for the region is greatly affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the US Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on Mexico's Lower California Peninsula.
Rosa, who will still have the strength of hurricane on Sunday morning, with wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north 19 km per hour.
The storm is finding itself with cold water in the Pacific and therefore, losing strength.
For this reason it is expected that it will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or the night of Monday.
It could rain very hard in some parts of Mexico, assuming a major risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and can be found at 250 l/m2", reportsweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or of what remains of him is the strong rainfall in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the southwestern desert of the United States," said Hurricane National Center.
It is hoped that these rains may cause sudden water trumps and debris streams in the deserts, and earth's detachments in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, so they found a 16-year-old boy with white gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4:00 (summer hours in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, respectively.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on their mobile phone.
Trump asserts that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the pettyness and cholera’ of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the pettyness and cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that that day the Americans witnessed the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an impoverished public service record," he said addressing the crowd of fans of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of republican results in mid-term elections.
"There are five weeks left for some of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "oppose and hinder."
It is hoped that the first procedural ballot in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, according to which CNN has been informed by an assistant of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke down on the beaches, when a big earthquake and a tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the village of Palu when waves of up to six metres broke into the ground at the luscofuscus, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still with their activities on the beach and didn't immediately flee, so they were dead," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a pre-trial roundup in Iacarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, logs, house, razed everything I could find," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had flown high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs disseminated by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed shops and buildings, crooked and overthrown bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) declared that the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantity" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he declared, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and no information" from Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not reporting on the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time when the warning was issued.
In a social media shared amateur recording, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building yelling frantically warning the people on the street about the arrival of a tsunami.
In a matter of minutes the water collides against the shore leading forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to certify immediately the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a major disengagement that has caused communications to be cut throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun to ship cargo aircraft from Iakarta and other cities, but the evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that the World Vision staff traveled to get to the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Dosebah.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," she said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups started the unpleasant task of launching disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voicemail from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves up to international aid, but that time has not yet come."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, relatives and friends of the disappeared clinged to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that alleviates the depressing argument of natural disasters."
Saturday they pulled a child out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the paragliding Indonesian national team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mantagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the broadcast of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the parapentist community, he had desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, in the messages only one gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he added.
They steal 26,750 dollars while reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was recharging a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, the investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the car driver had emptied a cashier into the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While I was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the report, witnesses have seen several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, please contact the Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Fox Kanye West changes his name for Ye
Fox Kanye West changes his name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The former known Kanye West."
It's been a while since West, 41 years old, is known to Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who canceled his attendance with "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'tis'," I had said that same year West as I spoke about his record with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of malice, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye's another of the famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be named Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also managed to put the script on and off and use capital letters.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised not to use the military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he would never use the military again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the kids who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
The US should double the investment in I.A.
According to AI's professional and investor Kai-Fu Lee, former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 in AI innovation in 2030.
"Duplicate the budgeting in AI research would be a good start, since the other countries are way behind America, and we're looking for the next big advance in AI," Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the odds that the next AI achievement would be done in the U.S., said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won American Othello's player with the highest score and was subsequently an executive in Microsoft Research at Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Robotic Retrieval of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency and asked when it would be the next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee says.
"China is not who is leading academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired college geniuses to work at AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. drive their efforts at AI.
"I think they should offer residency cards to doctors at AI," he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the select artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in motion for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and which had blocked their applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was, "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said that they would achieve the result of the vote and that they would definitely do so.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state election commission stated that no irregularities had been recorded at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our head up and not by the service door," added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the requirement.
Another survey carried out by Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A referendum failure would represent the first major blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since it had gained power in May from the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, goes through all Brighton's defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported on Brighton's defense with 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro made it look ridiculously easy to score the goal of minute 65.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton's defenses before he ran the open field.
Then Aguaro found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He broke out of a defense before he overstepped several more at the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he passed the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English foreman used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's bodyguard with a shot to the right of the network.
"Aguerio is going through some trouble on the foot," said the City coach, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have marked it at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the blue-celests the initial advantage in the face of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th.
Agüero received the ball at the depth of Brighton's field at that played.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole across the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The blushes put the ball on the porch before they left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to hear the Rockies party
With the Nationals out of the struggle for the elimination, there wasn't much reason to force another tenure.
But a always competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Rockies Colorado, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies' election, which will lead a win-win match to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still try to close their first division title.
"Although we haven't played anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opener on Sunday, but they appear to be inclined to have Scherzer launch into a situation like that.
Scherzer, for who would be his start number 34, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 of this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the elected Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he talks about the importance of the result in mid-term elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
It takes five weeks for some of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, it's not my job, but I really do it and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates," she said.
Trump continued to say, "You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, wickedness, and pettyness.
They don't care who they hurt, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we're never gonna give it to."
The Democrats' mission is to oppose and obstruct."
"And you've seen it for the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats as "crazy, valiant, disgusting, and liars."
He enlisted the Senate's Judicial Committee by summoning Senator Dianne Feinstein by her name, who received strong public urges.
"Remember your answer?
Filter document?
Mmm. Hey, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't too surprised.
after all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs who are not well received, and all by saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because he faced himself decisively with anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
about the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security and about Europe, casually topics about which Jeremy was telling the previous leaders.
The notification for the nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the committee's Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if ever it started.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when fellows with whom he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect that he would portray me and adopt positions with which he would never agree, whether in national security or in the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact a little bit like what I say, there's a tremendous riot and attacks on social networks censoring central politics, telling me it shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it's not just about me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments they address to me are usually political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my fellows who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "non-confidence" movement or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
For the last few years, I've received a lot of advice to keep my head down, unless I'm so frank and then "everything would be okay for me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party, 32 were still in school, led by the neglect of Thatcher's government that had literally dropped out of my classroom, I've tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, whether local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could mistake my political stances and I disagree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, all I would say is that while the country is walking towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An indicted Ayr gets to the fore
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little bit, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this tiny little game of Tenent's Premier League.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only invict team of ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking it, led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've been put to the test in our party and we're still indicted, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "You have to admit that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead of him, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot picked up a bad pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he turned a solo shot, leaving the marker 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the severe injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who abandoned the field as a padiola and, since the reboot, Ayr advanced further through a test by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose got away with having one more player with a never-consumed Bruce Colvine essay at the end of a period of a lot of pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placing Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored an essay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had almost done since the start, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in the area of David Armstrong and had sent him to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth essay from the local team.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the catering industry after it has been discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it looks like Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he's director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "good restaurant business".
'The sea is ours: the interior Bolivia expects the court to go to the Pacific
The sailors were guarding a naval headquarters covered in devices in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag on them.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned from the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to recover it."
In Bolivia without the sea, the memory of a coastline lost before Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 19th century continues alive, just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's ruling on giant screens throughout the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in the Monday sentence.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that CIX's sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," says Chilean expert on international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," says Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill that remained for Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
Both countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had been making an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless you can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of United Nations.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment occurs at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that America's continuing sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington they resist accepting the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's generalized scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your hat collection or just cover yourself completely from the sun, don't look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that amazed the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats filled Instagram this summer, and these designers pulled their most amazing creations out of the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beast hat adorned with a wide tab imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were defiled sandwiches, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, with the glasses and the tube, and another a melted ice cone.
And if you're a fan of huge fashion, you're lucky.
The trendy people predicted that giant hats could get to the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb," the straw hat with a 60-centimeter tab that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks brought to the gateway another great creation: a bag of straw beach almost as big as the model tied with a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the outstanding piece of the spring summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope that hats and large beach bags will arrive at the shops next summer, as the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is reinforced only by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS for their acronyms in English), strive to provide the best level to students and their parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their pupils for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that's worth his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he'll reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the board and the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained a excel.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained honorary enrolment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them to be key skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At present, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and all kinds of programs.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of knowledge of languages is 17% of the reasons employers find it difficult to fill vacancies.
So language skills are becoming increasingly essential to preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered to be most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have a number of languages to choose from and specialized teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages are still of vital importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this.

Lebron debut with Lakers on Sundays in San Diego
Waiting is almost over for the sawmills who wish to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton announced that James will play the early pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still a matter of deciding how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers matches.
At this point in my career I don't need pre-season matches to be ready," he said.
Trump's electoral events reach Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the five Trump scheduled rallies next week, including the stops in cities related to him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation on hold for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming half-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can view Trump's rally in West Virginia on YouTube live stream.
Trump will probably address the issue of the trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense by accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate's confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the elections in November with a new impetus.
So these five meetings that Trump will give next week aim to "customize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible out of the campaign season," said Reuters to a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
Tonight's rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together sympathizers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won for over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA Shows Endurance to Fight and Keep Hope Live Up to Sunday's Individual Games · Global Voices
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon antsome might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sport concept, but in what sportsmen really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I suppose we've got that as a bit of a push," said Jordan Spieth as he marched at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in their favor and much to cheer up for, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one counts three points of four.
Spieth proved lethal from the tea to the green and is preaching with the example.
Those guttural screams made themselves stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the putt that made them win the game in 15, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
"Just concentrate and worry about your game," said Spieth.
He's the only one left to these players now.
18 holes to leave footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple have four out of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them how the rivals beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win a victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly sent Sergio García, the morning furball hero, when he paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first run ended up with the Spanish and the Swede in a hole than they had ever been close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they give, the advice they don't, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has hold to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the four-balls and four-somes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty raising four points to the scorer at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood," after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the first four matches in Ryder Cup's story.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the furballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a disincarnated Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two games on Saturday without grief or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in the modalities of four and foursomes and five followed.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's furballs, met again with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes looking for a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world's number one and three.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant breeze day in southwestern Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas champion set the point of reference for Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and won again Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There was only twice in Ryder Cup's story that a team goes back four points in individuals, although as current trophy holder, Furyk's team just needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of reach.
North Heart says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased his mistrust in the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling nuclear test camps and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer from the US," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first."
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization by virtue of which North Korea would be rewarded as he took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed himself to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula as Trump secured the security of North Korea.
North Korea is looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War from its mother, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive outcome, and even if they oppose "the declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions exacerbate our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned in the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the other part of this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly, it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after Trump's "bad president" called Kim's man rocket on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, which last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking action for disarmament, but said that there's still a lot of work left to do and that sanctions should stay until North Korea's denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that "it's the same if it's been two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, Thursday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the Security Council's sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would come back to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't work out.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had moved forward, only a few hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafious demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
He indicated that Kim had told him that the "proper measures" he requested were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all its students last longer in order to combat the growth of male culture from studying all night long stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar found that students at the number one university in the world often don't know the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Muller, conceived the course, which he thinks is the first of this guy in the United States.
Inspired to begin the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up and said, 'Why do they just tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits that help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour duration implies a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine when you go to bed.
In another section, participants are informed how long sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who implied sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Guaranteeing that he sleeps enough and that he has a good quality sleep must be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he points out, even avoiding fattening, because lack of sleep makes his brain enter in a way of ignition, which makes him starve constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course on the entire campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. It is also recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal overthrows Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when the Dolly Menga attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team intended to record their first home victory from the triumph for 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team occasioned Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points from Hearts, Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an alignment of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that it was to tie.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth post, Livingston went up to third place and was only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence online judge had to have treated for a head wound after he was supposed to launch an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the half-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 Livingston who got a point on Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his organized set suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the ball.
They could have marked it in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to the doorstep of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second stick.
The Rangers took over, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their play in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have had to jail you at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the old Ibrox guard Liam Kelly just had trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers has failed again to cope with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher set the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard acted at rest when he changed Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, which almost had an immediate effect when the zurdo made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead at the end of the day, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he got in the way with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACTED... was the day when the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany was born.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", starring those apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by mineral radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immunological system to "see" defective cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
You can see a protein common to various types of cancer and inject it back.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impels the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
An approach similar to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "signals" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after his appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was released in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, where he wore a cap from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on the demands for sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Chris Rock went up the images of West's critique of social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that it had been a bad time in the backstage because of his hat.
"They passed with me in the back.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was leaving," said Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pike?", saying that he would "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments prompted the hearings at least twice, and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole study was silent."
They had appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, rapier Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexed by an interpretation of song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
West received the support of the conservative group leader TRUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: THANKS FOR DOING FRONTE TO MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, tweeted saying that West was simply "who is and that's completely wonderful."
"So I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think is hugging and spreading an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
Just like we did," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the officially known man as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The young man Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in sword management as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it looks like young people often have to be tough to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo (#EuTamén) era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-protagonist Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, when we're wrong about masculinity?" she said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we'll see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the great questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series arrives at the end of next summer, asserting that "a lot of horses and battlefields".
As of November, Kit will feature a replacement of True West, by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so she somehow provided me with my future family and my life from here forward," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, declared health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, inter-annually, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they claim that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual intercourse with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaks data from Republican Party senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, the US representative, Maxine Waters, denounced the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Party senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradereita".
"Minds, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
The information disseminated included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in the Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie."
The Waters Declaration immediately aroused online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This scornful man became angry," wrote Fleischer.
"He understands that he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It must not be challenging.
You mustn't question the accuser's motives.
It must remain pleasant and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to which critics accused him of looking too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it were true," he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the law enforcement entities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We shall ensure that we discover the culprits," he continued, "so that they are considered legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again, Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, who began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the matter of the obviously stupid that we are at the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the incompetent character of Johnny's jumpy-eyed and rubber-faced character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-anglophone cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the dumb secret agent who, despite his strangled claims of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the topic of Firecars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once interpreted in the now forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, where he sowd chaos in his passage.
A couple of good moments ago at Johnny English's last release.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor steps make a brief crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy pops into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" films, like 007 and Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, the extravagant misadventures of Johnny English are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's movie jokes change by embossing Bean's character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates the supersecret web spy network of Britain and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent who is on duty, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination for a prime minister who is pompous and in conflict, who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
His intelligence advisors informs us that as all spies committed themselves, they must get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives off-official lessons about how to become an infiltrator agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the academy of spies to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with his former and suffering colleague Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batmans and Robins of His Majesty's Secret Service's mistakes are back in action, meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the multimillion-dollar tech charismatic who claims that he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falcatrudas: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a ostensibly French restaurant; they create a tumult that illegally put them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
Evidently, all the arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it looks like it's taken out of a child television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five.
Presumably, the party wants businessmen to spend their savings through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an additional day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and its plans to incline the country in favour of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has supported shifts four days a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is hoped that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that adjusts to the party's focus to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its campaign for the general election of 2017.
However, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day working week does not enter party politics and is not being considered by the party."
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in the public service companies.
The chancellor's plans in the shade also imply the possibility that current water companies shareholders will not recover their entire investment, as a labor government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on the company councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector business shares to employees, which package annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, on the broadcast of an interview, the 60-minute reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the prosecution came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unmovable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," I said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied it very well," added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive poster of stars that will act and an equally impressive mission, to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people marching to Central Park's Great Lawn area, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience attended had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success of the Global Citizen 12 years from achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism," people who think it makes a difference by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, driving a number of different goals.
He claims that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than $2250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from their shares, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executor company that has committed to "helping children develop to their full potential," with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Global Citizen tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," said the crowd, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to perform a "block" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of Interior announced.
"If necessary," Washington can resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including that of the Middle East, unveiled U.S. Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the request of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and the means to face it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called himself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, bearing in mind that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia saying that "only has a tactic" with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a "captive" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipeline of $11 billion, which was set up to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said after the meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, which took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. stance got the reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for the presidency by 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine his presidential candidacy after mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an investigation by the FBI is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it has been shown that most of Warren's own voters don't believe he'll be presenting by 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator wouldn't file her candidacy, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre and Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the application.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other names highlighted by the Democrats in connection with a possible nomination in 2020, include former vice president Joe Biden, and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, reported the Associated Press Agency.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin Poststraumatic Stress Disorder (TEPT) at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"With what my own son is going through, with what's happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds our soldiers get back with," explained the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "are returning differently, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what militia mates and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum-seekers who challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace's session award that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be prosecuted in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition infringes that principle," was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' entry into the U.S. economy, explaining that it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and that they will "provide labor."
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims who escape domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"A asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," told Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China to Exist Abuse With Propagandistic Announcements
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper advertising the benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa state, after accusing China of going into election to the U.S. Congress, which will be held on November 6, which denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. election, marked what the officials of that country joined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
While foreign governments are usually publishing commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war, witnessing the leveling of oranges in their respective imports.
According to China and US experts, China's compensatory oranges at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters of states like Iowa, which supports the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and Iowa's ex-governor, one of China's leading exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing has harmed US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published on Moines Register Sunday, it was stated that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press."
"By spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press by publishing a bill of payment in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper stand at the end of this Beijing street, they are few in dissenting voices and no real reflection can be seen of the disparate opinions that the Chinese may have about the worrying economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
He also states that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer of publishing" his article, although he has not confirmed what journal it is.
Kavanaugh's disaster loses women's Republican vote a few days after mid-term elections.
Although many of the main Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the different accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The reactions to these accusations were numerous, and most Republicans positioned themselves to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubted that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the mood of angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, as well as they won't forget it in the near future or in November," thought Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, the flu of "Acercase Novembre!", manifested themselves in the hall of the Senate, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectation," assured Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It is true that he is already tall,
But even more so, especially among the undecided women voting in neighborhoods outside or between the ages of 18 and 29, who, even if they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans were to continue with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early this week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench of the defendants or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps the Democrats choose on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing Ford's testimony and that of Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the people surveyed believe in Ford's testimony, or probably 35 percent who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38% believe that Kavanaugh most likely lies during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a college party when he was studying at Yale in the '80s.
Creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to," he said about the startup.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, to-dos lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data store unique, is that the user has a complete control over who can access what information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify their business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous homage in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded September 29, 1918, in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military award.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honor in a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that he deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gun fire."
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with a "great bravery," directed the line forward before rushing down with a cannon and without anyone's help, and knocking down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, age 72, affirmed that his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson still like that."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth gang.
Michael Vann said he felt "honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero proves the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the MMA fans' reel at the best time
Imagine you've been up all night enjoying Bellator 206's whole show, and when it gets to the best part, something prevents you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 combats, six of which were the main ones, and was broadcasting live in the UK in Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see their faces, the viewers in the United Kingdom were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours awake waiting to see the struggle.
A fan described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a very tasteful joke."
"State legislation states that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why he had to switch to child programming," said Mr. Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about the repetition," Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change came, I started receiving a lot of messages, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five struggles, instead of six, and we want to give our fans the best, but we go on and on.
It gives us a lot of anger.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited to the first show of the Desert Island Discs 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he started talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to other people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
He also said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what prompted me and gave me the strength necessary to achieve success."
I wanted to show that it was "someone" so that people didn't feel disappointed to discover their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a leading LGBT activist and used his appearance in Commonwealth games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time champion of the world said that falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "was a total surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at only 14 years old he first participated in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was a ticket to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell you that I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," said Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that he was not really invincible," he adds.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," she said.
The selection of Heather Small's Proud is also not in vain, as it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and he's still wearing his sharp hair.

A Mickelson in low form ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to improve his technique so that he doesn't become an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank by the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the four-ball or the four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times to America, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Though it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of their career, at their 48 years old it doesn't fit in the tight Le Golf National field, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday match to the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, start with a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he was playing today, he gave me a slap on my shoulder, he handed me his arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," Furyk shared.
"He trusted fully in himself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I probably hadn't thought I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end, that's the way it is, and so we thought it was supposed to be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will outnumber Nick Faldo in the largest number of games played at the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual palmaret.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides the team with intangibles.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with engineering and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players have spent with him this week.
He's a lot more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in Ryder Cup's last day can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Grand Danish debuted in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for a little," Bjorn reflects, in the photo, after watching the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for all of them.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the bookmarks are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I'm not tired of saying this, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of their players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added, "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you test your ability as a golfer to the full.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, that they get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Bjorn's difference, Jim Furyk will look for his players to have a better individual performance than their colleagues, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points to four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those last day turns, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser in the European miracle at Medinah."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when asked himself to remember how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players face to face the last day.
"We have 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah's.
When you see the impulse going in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and putting players as we thought we wanted to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the ranking.
"I've decided this order because I think it covers all the way," explained Bjorn about his selection for the individual.
Germany's new warship postponed once more
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing cost, local media reported.
The service of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the burning Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-erial and anti-bomb missiles, as well as with concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to unfold the newest frigates up to two years outside the source ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be old-fashioned when they enter service.
The unfortunate Fragate F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the staff needed in the old Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Besides bad hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed that it already reaches the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million, compared to the initial EUR 2200 million.
The problems of the newest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to unload.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
Likewise, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new research being carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bat Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Pucotus auritus in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An audio analysis conducted by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and students also pose a risk, as well as traps with fly glue, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
The bats are not blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, inspections of children and occasionally even rescues.
The organization has even the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the state manager, claims that this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We count on old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things that we still don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single motherhood child could kill up to 400 females and children, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many of the species, we don't know how they're going to their populations."
Ronaldo dismisses the lawsuits for rape and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get acquainted with using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The foreman of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 to say nothing about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33, has been sealing this fake news on a live video since his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times not.
What was said today is false," he said in front of the camera, the five-time winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man," added the smiling player.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which qualify as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have happened in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her anally, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayor claims Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying he was 99% a knight, but that that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both have had sexual intercourse consented to by both parties.
Mayor also held that he had gone to the police and that he had photographs of the wounds, but later he accessed an extra-judicial agreement because he felt terrified by reprisals and was worried about public scorn.
34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the deal while continuing traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would regret for ever the loss of its position as world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had claimed in the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for the manufacture of Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons the EU at the end of March, we will witness how production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota general manager at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK also expressed their fear of EU abandonment without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if no agreement is reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes comes supplier parts from the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortages.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace more than a day at Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid such border controls."
"It's essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success, but also make the most of this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent chains of sub-minister."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would take place, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, Burnaston's employee for 24 years and union coordinator from the United States, said that his members are increasingly worried, "Experiencefully, I know that once these jobs go missing, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be nicer again
The White House has stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the Assistant Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed another week due to the struggle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Russian assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Either Trump dismisses the adjunct attorney general, or if he doesn't, which would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judicial committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
At the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There's not yet a date fixed, it could be this week or be delayed another week, given everything that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, as Sanders has been running since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of informational sessions was not due to an aversion to the grandiogram of reporters, although he added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any source that would move that data.
Briefings will continue, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that's much better than to ask her questions.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and that's going to replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the health secretariat to calm the moods before Brexit
The health secretariat sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and conveys their wish to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to covering the cost of applications for EU status to EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote, "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment have continued, and decisions are scheduled to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of anxiety for all of us.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
The fellow Members of the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was submitted to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's trainer, informed the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he passed out when he got to the bandwidth.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the line before taking him on a stretcher to conduct a follow-up evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Similarly, he added that there are still no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old red shirt student, is on his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tickets a total of Saturday before leaving the match, which raised to 18 his total season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK. This extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will help the government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping in the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second houses and purchases for rent, may be up to 3 %.
Facenda expects the change to be able to raise up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of London's new constructions are bought by non-residents in the UK, which is causing higher prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "sympathetic cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for a cut in the farm tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused large builders of keeping the prices of high houses through the purchase of land and the non-use of land, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on moderately priced houses to address the "disgrace of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of reforms in relation to housing, including rent control and the ban on evictions where the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant larger municipalities powers to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it's not fair that it's as easy for those people who don't live in the UK, as it is for companies based on foreign, to buy homes as it is for British residents who work.
For too many people, the dream of being homeowners is too far away, and the indignity that supposes not having a roof remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, has stated that his "last ambition" is to become the Scotsman at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reliving the Northwest Club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound program.
"I thought I saw Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in the position of Sunderland coach are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic states that he has not felt any concern about the success of these well-established figures in such a large club after rejecting previously proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will success for me depend at this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly unique to a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to get here, but it's likely that I only consider it successful here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years after a period of assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within Hearts' technical staff.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and managed to get the St Mirren to be about to come down to earn the title of the Championship the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than ever during his career as a Clyde player, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"He probably found me at a royal crossroads," he remembered, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn't hurt me, I made a reasonable living and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot you must get through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure from work, but training likes me.
I've always liked to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial consultancy, who was responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and the permanence of England in the football world for longer than expected caused a pattern similar to that of June in July, in which pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the volume of business of restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specializing in drinks were the best results with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Publics specializing in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink.
In pubs and bars controlled the consumption of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the consumption of meals decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for the analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said, "These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if it is added to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for catering business and the time will be in charge of telling whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide as much breath as necessary for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK's Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with profit sets of more than £9 billion and is considered the industry's benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One in five children (some just 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "Fake Insta"
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One in five children (some just 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a growth in the number of "Fake Insta" accounts (referring to the Instagram social photo exchange network).
This news has provoked an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a soft "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who came across the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked her to be raped.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmisters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "A startling result is that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the council of the Scottish federation of athletics
Elidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish federation of athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has set this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and worldwide, and we are confident that Scottish athleticism will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be a spokesman for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help direct the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
She wrote on Twitter, "There's been an apoplexy a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and how far I'd go.
It was exhausting work, but I've managed to recover completely, I've learned to walk again, and I'm currently exercising agility.
Thanks for the encouragement."
An announcement of a breast milk extractor comparing women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A mother's milk extractor company has divided public opinion into networks with an ad in comparison to nursing mothers with cows they're whistling at.
To announce the launch of the world's first silent portable breast milk extractor, Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast extractor to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in an ugly barn for cows at the pace of a song with letters like, "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Because you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on, "Wow, wet, I'm feeding the babies, wet, wet, I'm stirring my friends."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among the spectators. Many of them said that it manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to announce this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after they give birth," wrote one.
Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal subjector (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Of course traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to announce a milk extractor to mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an ad with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even a woman said that the song seemed "very funny."
"It seems to me that this is a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Removing my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement's a little messed up, but I played it like a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented, "This is a fun ad directed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "vacks".
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they've been dancing with the discreet extractors inserted in their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The extractor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism that exists between women and dairy cows, we want to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges that it involves while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that the extractor Elvie has held the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-creature mother paraded at the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign sponsors to children.
Traditionally, most godfathers were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid of endangering their ability to remain in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to take on minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of those who are godfathers or who are part of the home of these people are found in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require any of these to appear in court before a month has elapsed since they were arrested instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the shelter workers.
Many will appear by videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent kidnappings or attempts to escape according to the shelter workers and system reports published over the last few months.
Lawyers have stated that these fears increase in larger centers like Tornillo, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms that a child is having a bad time go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends might be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were found to be in Syrian alone illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in the right way."
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that conditions were appropriate for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel Idlib bastion allowed continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would be aimed at the jihadists, including the soldiers on the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draw up an outline of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the agency should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term?
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get reelection in 2020 unless, as many Liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
Which would definitely be the most dramatic end of a presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, the first-time audience indexes have multiplied by more than two, to a total of 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and have almost tripled to a maximum of 1.6 million viewers in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in early hours, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led cable channel audiences with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news came.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, drama showrunner for ABC "Designed Survivor," who's about a secretary from the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why, he asked her.
"He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, Washington's plots can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether migrant families can rejoin and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin bomber jacket ("a gift full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s flawed descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what makes it get it to look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," a space that deals with the characters changes and the Trump show's daily argumental turns (the conflict with N.F.L., the eloxies to Kim Jong-un...).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he made sun and a temperature of 26 degrees away from home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC as he filmed CNN.
He couldn't get away with it while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court by hanging on a wire.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows at that time and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a bit of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign money goes to a lot to fund the candidatures of the House for the elections of half the legislature.
It's no surprise that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional District with two career representatives to occupy the same position.
This district located on the outskirts of Pittsburgh which was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who won his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is present against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is largely overtaken over the new 17th District.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that the Republicans manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congressional District unveiled a campaign financing festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning a tight victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which they enjoyed a broad follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then went back.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization's executive team.
State Department officials decided to order the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the department in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million of US aid during 2017, including controlling drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was undermined.
The sanctions proposed, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to avoid the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance of administering him, the diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction to Mr Trump's justice, of which there are currently abundant evidence in the public file.
According to the news, Mr. Mueller is also leading his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must be accountable to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may at last have to face a popular jury.
They're very incognitive, and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to take a coup d'état against Hitler if the western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that took place later.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable advance of democracy is either accelerated or backward.
Americans are facing several of those points of inflection right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Roger Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that The Times' information is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the election of half the legislature for a Congress that demands responsibility for Mr Trump?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subject to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was an embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to arrest Candís of Shabbat on that table that included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favorable position to rank as Group G of the Europa League.
An injury to the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, for the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and reach a point.
We had a chance to win at the end, but, in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but on the second half we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was tough among everything that happened to my injuries and the changes on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
Team's good, guys are having a good time and training's good.
We hope we can fight, forget last season, and succeed."
Women worry about savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had made it clear how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study by Nationwide stated that they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Just 10% said they'd talked to their kids about it.
"People want me to take care of a relative, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
You can start with the next one.
You can't prepare your family to look after you if you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Among the options for financing long-term care are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.
Also appreciate the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your father or older mother has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?

A man gets several shots with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a rifle of compressed air as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, aged 40, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 p.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to grow.
Because of the cut-off of communications, the rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Then we provided them with some key data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that lies over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This region, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Célebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years by Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the Pacific fire belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis they have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude struck south of Xava, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude affected the Mintawai Islands, located opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
On this occasion there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which resulted in the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily thrown away.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a crime of domestic violence, to prevent a complaint of domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, KTUU said.
He presented himself before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when asked, reported the prison.
Palin faces three minor offences of type A, which means he could enter prison for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor offence of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing a complaint about domestic violence and the possession of arms in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His fiancée had accused him of punching him with a fist in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that she suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
They count at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and it is expected that the balance of dead will increase with the passing of days.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Central Celebes, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Iakarta.
Videos are circulating around partner networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal records seek to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane from Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, chasing the lives of pedestrians and cyclists who found on their way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack took place, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder offences in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," declared the prosecutors in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent to accuse.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York hasn't been prosecuting a death penalty case in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS that he visualized on his phone according to the charge.
He also requested to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was found not guilty of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal law-enforcement lawyers charged with representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of life imprisonment guilt without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.

Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the conference tory.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that they should deal with negotiations with the EU.
The ordinary Member Peter Bone said before the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would have already left the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge of reconciling the divided ranks of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep her Chequers plan commitments between the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the counter-attacks and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave movement of Solihull that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that he should have counted on Mr Farage to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been given office, we would already be outside the EU at this time," he said.
The Member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false."
The member of the tories and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also went to the march, from which he showed to the reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers' plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians “sit uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is currently a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we are gathered today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK."
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) after the group launched this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology in Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy the free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It is an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren's planning to seriously think about presenting himself for the presidency.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren said she'll seriously consider her candidacy for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a locality west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be presenting himself to re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been focused on speculations that place it as Trump's successor by 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the county format since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked if she was planning to introduce herself to the president.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems, and that's what a woman needs at the presidency's post."
A detention was performed in connection with the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU's basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 (Eastern Time).
They had posted a shooting video on Friday asking for help identifying a man who was going out in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus on the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and finally died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter-old youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches with 10 past season titles and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to his team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas was ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would be decisive in his career.
Boots, which set off from the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton alone as he defended his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes one day later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ahead of him after several wheel-wheeled maneuvers which caused Ferrari's driver to be released badly at the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen set off from the last row of the exit grid and went back to the seventh square at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get to go faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally went into boxes around 44 but couldn't advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended up with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a true knight.
The team did extraordinary work to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An inadequate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by her insistence that she had not filtered Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, disgusting and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate the last few days, when the outrage is seen, when it is seen that the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you made any leaks?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.' added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leaking came from his office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the newspaper The Hill.
"I asked him to keep his confidentiality and I did what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented on the following during Saturday night's event: "I tell you, body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it out, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inadequacy of sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any necessary means.
They are evil and disgusting, they don't care who they harm, who they have to run over to regain power and control," said the President, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the match back by 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead with two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the local set before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to go back to winning Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was about the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories prior to the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in minute 3:35 thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a rough initial period, Sullivan returned to match number 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score goal number 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants moved forward on the score before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard recoupled the match with a goal through power play in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined with each other to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured victory through his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next match, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure that hundreds of passengers on an aircraft escape an earthquake
An Indonesian airman considered a hero after he died to make sure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a big earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower in Palu, which was violently balanced.
He stayed at his post to make sure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the exit track at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the tower of control when he thought he was going to fall down.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, said that it is possible that this decision would save hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are heartbroken when we find out," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll can be thousands, and the disaster management agency in the country has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victims' balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency spokesman.
Waves of up to six metres devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said the following to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets».
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
Indonesia has previously suffered earthquakes this year in Lombok where more than 550 people have died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Area boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed on the lagoon before it reached the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has passed the airstrip.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in very little time.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to move forward between the water reaching their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and scared, and that he suffered a slight wound to the head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on the enhancement tasks of a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office went to court on Saturday's rehearsing of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recover the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis' movements, and the 19-year-old, Jessica Chambers' victim, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported in the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that that day he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted his messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"It was blurry of his life," Hale said.
It's scheduled for the defense to begin its claims at the end of Sunday.
The judge showed that he hoped that the trial would be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its source with political and social messages.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
A New York babysitter demands a couple after a "racist" message.
A New York babysitter will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother who complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish by finding that the child-career Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had just left, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid the day of work and sent home to an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for dismissal and requires compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which I was initially hired even if there was no contract by way of contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," the Post said on Friday, to add later, "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
"My wife had sent you a message that I had not intended to send you.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person whom they offended, though it had been due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby for two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Did they go for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion tribunal has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear as they could end up with a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the following about the letter: "It's hard to get on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's so much fun to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
After stating that his father, who had worked as a chambermaid for the BBC before inspiring to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was "agridoce" after his death last year.
From Paddington to what he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud though you didn't really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a bit like that.
Though it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye via the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked successfully to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep his heart latexing were slowly consuming and abandoning his body.
He had died a while before and now he was turning off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment in mourning for her daughter's loss, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the calvary she was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
"He had his head down and tears fell at all times.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this amazing feeling of solidarity for Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posts of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers you can call to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when she began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel myself every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room."
However, he left work before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented, "I have continued concern for a side effect."
Mrs. Davis has created the cards to inform people that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been with Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in your attitude.
Christmas day has reached its heart (when the children have opened their presents, they have made no visual contact with them or anything)".
He said that his death was an enormous trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He ripped the family apart.
He broke us.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on to a thread while the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time and limited scope research), we might be able to get a little bit of unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "disrupting" because of the paralysing of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
Five weeks are left for the elections of half of the legislature (November 6th). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI carries out its report?
There has been a vote in the Senate, currently holding 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under Kim's mandate
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, stated that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people responsible for passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
The vast majority of Northern deserters have finally been offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often return them compulsory.
The relations between the north and the south (which technically continue in war) have improved dramatically over the last few months.
In the same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-a held in Singapore, where they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security and, in those circumstances, there's no possibility that we could unilaterally disarm first," said Mr. Ri in a speech addressed to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and claims that it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and assured that he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved that way, they would call her hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations of sexual abuse about Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and speaking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, catalysing the accusations against him as a "hassle of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelasi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
By the way, he objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then it's not right to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you're currently at," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal of Washington D.C.
He said that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the law of patient protection and care of accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It is not the time for a hysterical person with prejudice to access the court and yet on top wait for us to say, look how well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't expel it without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do you?"
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that was that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking that I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then I kept going.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they essentially do not understand each other.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an anger impossible to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from his presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," I remarked among laughs 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarves."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fund-raising, so he swore he wouldn't go to the presidential career unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of the supporters contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by the emotions (from gratitude to the people who supported her, from frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to the voters instead of the delegates and from anger at the existing sexism) that ran out of words.
"You'd think she had suffered a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder reminded her of how the press reacted with her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Chorou?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a distancing between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, first warned earlier this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of 200,000 million dollars, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has contracted in the same way each time, the latest by raising the rates from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China promised to imitate American measures and seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will move in the short term.
To get Washington to back off, it would be necessary to give in to your demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts claim that if Beijing is able to play his cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than it was previously recognised," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centred researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study centre.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war over seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional help or countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team for a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It's the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat on European territory and it's been winning a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the one who offered the most battle during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in hole 16 of pairs 3, losing his departure against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's first racer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups disputed, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I can get my drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a moved Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his countryman John Ram, who managed to defeat the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods for 2&1 in the individual party on Sunday.
"It's amazing how proud I am today that I could have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching that boy play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk declared after his team's frustrating performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put Europeans in trouble.
We fought.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get the hat out.
They were superior."
