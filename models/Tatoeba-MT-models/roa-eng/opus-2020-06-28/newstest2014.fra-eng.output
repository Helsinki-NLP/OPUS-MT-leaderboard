Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
The sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a swingsuit (a combination of wings), it rose to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 metres above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the decrepty motorway infrastructure, many are those who see a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above your car's dashboard.
The aircraft, which record all the thousands travelled by a motorist and transmit information to public servants, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and government offices to redesign the obsolete system of funding for major American roads.
The largely uninterested sector of large-scale planning has suddenly sparked a lively debate and moving alliances.
The libertarians have joined ecologist groups to put pressure on the government to use small boxes to keep track of the thousands you travel, and possibly of the road on which you move, then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental turn.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who plans that the state will start recording the thousands travelled by each Californian motorist by 2025.
There's gonna be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes that Americans pay for the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1%, while gasoline prices are high.
"The Gas Tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
Her state recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long run," he said.
Wonks calls this the cost of using mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious legislation on climate warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the House of Representatives Transport Committee, said he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Leaders of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay for miles.
"It's not just a tax falling into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Reason Foundation Policy.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the way of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have focused on about 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to town.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay to the state of the kilometres instead of petrol taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) explore how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists recently equipped their car with an aircraft, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least facts and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this sort of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge and entangled technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep the records of people's daily goings and comings.
Nevada is one of the few States that now move to find affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but not knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, he added Khan, the citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California startup named True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to States.
It sought to break through the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay for their mileage.
But the devices she tests have liked to the large axis planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register their speed and don't locate them," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors were made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have equipment at all, preferring to pay a package based on the average number of thousands travelled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to distrustful citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transportation managers are seeking to develop a charging device that would also be equipped to pay for parking costs, provide "customer payment" insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered by the system," said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on the payment of miles is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing petrol taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol, so that everyone pays its fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when simply needing aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four New Releases in Listening
The English musician did not finish surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury re-edition scheduled for November 4, with several novels.
Four have already emerged on the roof.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone on their feet.
On the day of his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be counted to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real feast for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three albums: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and wallets, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a foretaste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a wisely mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished Already Listening to
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal his charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a worrying intro before a luminous ride that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop dance.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer appears in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next to it, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The enticing guitar riffs give you the desire to leave Earth.
Bowie is in any case having fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man aboard a rocket, potential marc...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane characters.
No wonder he has a hand-in-hand mask in the photo of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, branded by Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them are released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not respond to the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
These included two cases reported by La Presse Canada, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year longer in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universal rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit to fight.
Under the current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesman for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch a animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to privilege the tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is scheduled only in 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The animated drawing, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a city in the west of America where she makes the order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the reporter for the U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide any answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has clearly been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, said to the Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been severely challenged following complaints that the NSA had overheard the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," he had to take advantage of that.
Mr Ströbele, German Green MP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to counsel from the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be in "security" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens from all over the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was of public value.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix on demand video service via their TV in a future that does not seem so distant.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained Cogeco's president and CEO, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the step towards its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date with regard to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite television providers to provide customers with the opportunity to pay for the services on-board.
"It's about two and a half years ago that we're saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages is not working," said Mr. Audet.
It hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, over the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline through depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the cabler Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier based in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Câble's income increased by 45% to $470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating this way.
For me, this is not the indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very lively competition.
Horses in beef products
Horse meat has been detected in beef-based canned products, sold by two small UK low-price distribution companies, today announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"As horse meat is not listed in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the UK agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist who was driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic had returned to normal around 6am on Friday.
Border Airlines plans to pay for hand baggage
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened cane with them to the descent of the plane.
The new carry-on costs relate to the bags in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Border stated that it would pay $25 if the expenses were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay in advance.
"We don't want to make this price pay," she explained.
The airlines started paying for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these expenses put as many things as they could into the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It is about making Frontier customers understand that it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a border boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand baggage costs will not be charged until the summer, although no dates have been set.
Passengers often rouse about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider adding baggage costs as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them were not paid baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage costs three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the surcharge.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the company's unusual hand baggage charges.
"I've never seen such a fluid boarding process in my entire career," he said.
I was expecting to see tooth creaks and a fight burst at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning."
Border also does as Spirit and charges $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cane with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for hand baggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to the airline.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Border went further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a thousand loyalty to customers who purchased their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of thousands by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1000-mile Border trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Border has a loyal clientele in its home town, Denver, but its activity shrinks and it loses money.
Revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an "internal error" and not computer hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency operating in the shade said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during an expected update," said the spy agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been out for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site through a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The NSA, formerly ultra-secret, once referred to as the "No Such Agency", has been under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized in the last few months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at national and international levels – which are part of the NSA secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by former NSA's abused consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have yet to find new jobs.
Delta promises not to let go of her employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, individual employees were met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Labor Relations of Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, head of Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be on the day in two years' time.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear's Purchase Project Amiens Starts With Zero Employees"
After throwing the sponge with failure in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of North Amiens promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that the factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant's purchase project in January, you're back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "said workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fou" trade unions, in order to the CGT.
We don't understand this twist.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save among the best-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours work handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are worked.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to enlarge.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But, with a correct price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys from Goodyear the factory closed.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan engagement before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the purchase project of the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we provide job-life assurances when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while aircraft deliveries and orders are down
Bombardier Inc, an aeronautical manufacturer and Canadian railway, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not provided flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of commercial commissioning by September.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the aircraft only flew three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to the forecast and the share price declined by 8 per cent to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his score on Thursday, from "surperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for raising the stock exchange in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the drop in aircraft deliveries has largely been anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division," Cameron Doerksen said in a customer rating.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its Cseries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the family of CSeries aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has been modest so far up to 177. Potential buyers seem to be waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's assertions regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airline aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 strong orders prior to the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by indicating that the programme was moving in line with the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground for longer than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the remaining ones will follow shortly thereafter, said the company.
However, analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first customer could fly a Cseries plane only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was assessing the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight test – although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1M.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and $4.56 Md income, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division represented $32.9 Md as at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautical revenues decreased by 13% to $2M.
Bombardier, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, said that the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11% to 2.1 Md$.
The Transport Command Book totalled $32.6 Md as at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from performance problems in relation to some large contracts.
The leaders announced that further indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of the financial management of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aeronautical manufacturer and competitor, reported a 10% decline in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a snout under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, and they learned Friday from the Isère Relief Speleo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one warrior to practice and the other no, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 pm to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
Then we were without news of them since, specified the same source.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5am," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Relief Speleo in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on the spot
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon on Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Chasers of Chambéry were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, went back to their steps while waiting for relief, specified the prefectures.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists' Union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services in the aftermath of further revelations on the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further," she says in a press release.
It considers Washington Post's information "scandalous" according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repeated lamps: a Member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relifting" the posts of the signposts in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project to repaint 16 poles of signaling lights in the region with yellow and blue colours in Brussels.
The goal is both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
In the long run, the idea is to rethink all the Bruxellois signalling lights at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Bruxellois MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Unsatisfied to spend the money of the Bruxellois in the relifting operations of the signposts to the colors of the Bruxelloise Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his flaming operations of the Capital", says Mr. De Bock in a statement.
After her black mango-yellow taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-yellow-yellow posts in Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Bruxellois deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who owns the NVA program.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of the Bruxellois!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis demolished
The green portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was demolished Thursday morning.
Some cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and the traffic on the national was diverted in the wake.
The decommissioning decision, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was made by Ecomuv, the portico manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticos to operate in the Finistère department, the other two having been disassembled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of connected glasses signed by Google.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a USB charger and cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibres or an intra-atrial listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "do".
There is no recipe, a mode of use to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat as I drove.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, sitting on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, cracked on this hospital bed in the frizzy sheets.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small daytime or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving in fur and as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that was in mourning.
And then, she was revealing to me while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost at all my mother's person but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This turn from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my dad, "in and out" looks like him.
I've always been told that.
I never believed him back then.
I've had a hard time with him until he's old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I got sick...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands watching my hands, lending him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He was leaving me intimidating.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life, makes me feel their presence because I still mean, what would they have said? What would they have thought? What would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I wake up often anxious when it happens and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, where I needed to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the level and he was smiling and he was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was sharing with joy what was coming to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor who I was at the time.
I have nevertheless realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and I am interested in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, have not been, with the setback, anatomous choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values that she has inculcated me are always present, so that I can think of how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be equal to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a loving soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I have been through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, at any time, in unusual places, unparalleled moments.
Then time eased the sentence.
It remains that the lack, this unanswered emptiness, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me at the bottom of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and she looks at me.
Every morning, I see his restless eyes standing on me, I see the circles that sway his gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the folds that mark the front of the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile, and uttering his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hollow of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when morals are a bit attained.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the slowing down of time makes us realize how much she was head of orchestra and we try to stay in the way she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take him from your heart and memories.
In some ways, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 following asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after he died, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from yours, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
In fact, I had problems with my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Soon my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense punishment that then invaded me has, of course, diminished but it is still close to me.
Very often he "lands" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that in awakening I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in relief, distressed and lit the bedside lamp by looking everywhere, convinced it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a profession of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have plenty of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
On Friday Baghdad published official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what happens in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide assistance.
Cocainomane Counsel Who Reported a Drug Sponsor on a Police Investigation was Imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assizes
A great defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, reported to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough on investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after he was compromised by his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was known as "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "first-rate case", was arrested at home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers found Sarborough, 32 years old, putting three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would not be revealed in broad daylight.
Today, at the Liverpool courthouse, Ditta, which works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, fell into displeasure after being found guilty on two counts of impeding justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted cocaine possession during a previous hearing.
The Lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at the home of Ditta and placing the drug, pure at 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went back to his home, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and collected a sample of hair.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he had clients calling him home for legal questions.
But the court heard testimony that he called for major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But that went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He impeded the investigation of the police as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, but he dishonored it.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he compromised his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal criminal lawyer to criminal himself as he began to procure drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has compromised it forever and made it vulnerable to the back-thinking of senior members of organized criminal groups who have charged it with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of confidence among the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire unit responsible for serious and organized crime conducted an inquiry into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three charges of cocaine possession and is now impeding justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to the complicity of trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the soul queen will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room at MotorCity Casino.
In November, Ms. Franklin was involved in recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without mentioning the disease she suffered, the famous performer of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of his Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a light coat: one could blow the heat to Menton with the invoice of the illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is more regulated by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least two injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator of the firing.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff turned to exits or on the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classic singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five salinettes imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to learn the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Reigne will come back with its lyric Destinations, a formula that is now a great fit for the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the concert-benefit held last August, with the assistance of the soprano coloratura Marie-Eve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air of the bat.
Without giving accurate figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is well developed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Finance is available and we hope to last up to the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even beyond," added the Director General, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a hostage child at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School is facing six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with taking hostage, sequestration, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New request for collective redress against the brothers Sainte-Croix
A new application for collective redress was filed against the Sainte Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time in the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J.J.", which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us, "I, I was there, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the Congregation of St. Croix and the Oratory Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological restraint on the victims", that they "have been aware of sexual abuse and have nevertheless stifled them", and that they have "sciently and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latter accusations are based, inter alia, on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Memile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is admitted by the Court, the second stage, namely the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the LaSalle district in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescues were called around 1am on Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were fired at the scene took nearly an hour to control the brewer.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the chief of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived at the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments could have to be provisionally housed, said the SIM.
Many oppositions to medical help die at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is held this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If emphasis were placed on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach would become minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Dery is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, said that the service would be useless anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick First, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the step.
For her part, the Liberal MP of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenya's press is outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of government" and that the restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "the grip on the media." The Standard stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and misled the bill as "draconian".
At the same time, the adoption of the bill involves a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by disseminating images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were derogating so-called the luxury shopping centre.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and one media officer to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following an uprising of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "discharged" or being unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is sufficient to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Freed to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and picking."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Commission for Wages and restored their mirbolic wages to approximately 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempted – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from Laval's Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) has caused a great deal of excitement in the direction of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Health, in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmacy department found itself very short-term in staff.
Nearly 30% of the staff needed were missing, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't resort to trouble, explained Mrs. Beaudet.
Some of our activities have been streamlined or reduced within the level establishment, as time goes by.
Of course, we worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] in order to get them to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is clearly easier for the pharmacy department of CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain had borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it's doing much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we use many young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always roll to three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and there are no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema through the small doorway.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama egrenes, in eight chapters that will come out in two strands (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragenary addict to sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance with his elder is striking: a silhouette of toast, a diaphanous dye and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one that had not hesitated to lay naked on ice paper will appear in situations much more sulfur on the big screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and in the middle of the ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their stink to the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, going through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing his actresses in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A room at the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following beatings to the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility evacuated the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the lacrimogenous jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers.
The room was aired and everything came into order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
On Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden into the country in pumpkins, Thursday morning, at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
That's when the passenger's luggage was checked out.
Cocaine had been distributed into three previously emptied pumpkins.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office that took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, says Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, the border officers at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have seized 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1653 drug seizures were made by border officers in the Quebec region.
Air raid on military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early in the afternoon on Wednesday, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 air-to-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new Tsahal air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) was not confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances approximately identical to the one that had taken place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed an Israeli attack on CNN, this time targeting the Yakhont sea-missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine's Approaching Bankruptcy · Global Voices
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt note goes to "B-", falling into the speculative investment category.
It has a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be further downsized within a year.
"It is becoming less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs," the US agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and anticipates that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits made abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, crumbling, the agency sees an increasingly probable devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay its gas imports to Russia, accusing it of not having paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth trimester of contraction.
His debt, still relatively modest, had exploded in recent years and S&P estimated it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with budget deficits, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had credited it with $15.3 billion and now only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new failed mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while also referring to "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "no improvement can be expected in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," said the expert, interviewed by the AFP, in 2015, for the presidential elections.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also points to the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of the opponent Iulia Timoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative consequences in short and medium-term terms related to Russia's reaction," S&P said, who fears "commercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which represents the quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green light from the United States at the Publicis-Omnicom fusion
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus drawing closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, foreseen by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," both groups announce in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on the obtaining of other regulatory authorities and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they add.
The Congolese army hunts down the M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to raid the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of the North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being chased out of the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which it controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We will prosecute the M23 and implore it wherever it hides because it is criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for FARDC to Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have martyred the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way alter his claims to the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion came to light in 2012.
At their height in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the chief town of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight from the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC staff was refurbished and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch at its end," predicts an expert on Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
Experts from the United Nations are accusing Rwanda, which strongly denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, which was originally made up of former Congolese mutiny soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week Kigali referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shells that fell into Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be one day liberated by the army," a resident of this neighbouring locality of Uganda testified.
"We lived in terror (of the M23), we were traumatized," he added.
The tests performed by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus proved to be negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second US oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit on Friday due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in decline compared to the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, rising from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to 380 million dollars.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil, reported Thursday a net profit in decline, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has, since the beginning of the school year, required the costs of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the committee and I was interested," Lefèvre explains.
In her view, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, consult and find solutions," Lefèvre says.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the Hotel-Dieu emergency closure
In the face of the furrow conducted for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "declining the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be possible on 4 November".
An official request made "to not run any risk on emergency management in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed at not hindering the campaign of the PS to a few months of the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although PPHA prefers to use the term "transformation" or "continuity change".
As of November 4, firefighters who were about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency crossings at the Hotel-Dieu will all have received the consent to take 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency interns will leave place Monday to five interns of general medicine.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4,", Loïc Capron, president of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APHP, who supports the management project, is assured without hindrance.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, claiming the continued presence of SMUR vehicles in place to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, too.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency service.
"Things happen gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, who, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of rendered service."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to," laments urgent doctor Gérald Kierzek.
He resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the fronde against the reorganisation project, he defined himself as a "warning lancer" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly swallowed up.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière emergencies.
At ARS, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
The "new hospital model" that has been in operation since October 7 and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year is being defended in the ARS and PAHP.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of an "ambulatory stay".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose themselves?" Gérald Kierzek asks for whom "the concept of emergency is not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People are not crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the minister doesn't take action by Monday, we're going to change the braquet, he warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the Health CGT.
We're going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and think about presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, the Paris UMP advisor, elected from the 4th arrondissement, makes it clear that "although the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we were to blame them."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable schedule of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama Ends Listening to IMF and the World Bank · Global Voices
Barack Obama instructed the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take over the NSA's listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the intelligence agency has mentioned the supervision of the IMF and the World Bank since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked on the subject, a US administration official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance against World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Expressing himself under the seal of anonymity, he did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the listening of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro the day before.
They were included in the final draft of the document, to be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "go beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful figures.
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, coughing them up, thousands gathered in the centre of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public event.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, general director of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the place of Independence of the capital Thursday.
For almost two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by white-run Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government in the context of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50M of investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, on October 17.
The assaults on former rebels then degenerate when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes the Renamo responsible for the outbreak of conflict, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French press agency, Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a speaker at the Open University and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ill movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the votes received by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who was expected to retire at the end of his second term next year, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
It is not exactly known what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangouts took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked whether Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the Government's frustrations, said Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people being also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is the president's to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," the author says.
Thor's Legend could show that "Ultimate force does not make weight in the face of subtle Russian," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for a "deep selection" of works adapted to age.
"I think it's great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "obviously didactic" makes the children "completely pick up", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer for adults and an adult writer for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known base of what we show and what we don't say.
One Hamas military force fighter was killed tonight and one injured by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, and medical and security sources in Gaza were learned.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they took out an Israeli armoured shell.
NSA espionage: the United States is "allied too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, recognized Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in the midst of controversy with Europe about the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that a US government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London where he participated from Washington on Thursday, October 31, via video link.
In his intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and information gathering through the necessary counter-terrorism efforts and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since depleted many bombing projects, through interception of communications and information collection.
"We've actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploded and people from being murdered, because we were able to be up-to-date with these projects," said the US diplomat.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been cheated."
But we strive to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal at a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome, admitted.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel mistaken."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden, states that the program named "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected in the only month of January last - ranging from metadata to emails, text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to express himself in this regard, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would relate to "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread on Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has called upon the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage that has also aroused China's presence.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its asset master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces Ligue 1 club in a press release.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without being the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply states that it is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection in the beginning of months.
A Ceremony in Memory of the Crematized Dead
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, must attend and explain at a press conference his proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a close friend, it is the opposite: the French prefer the burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose the cream.
In his book La Mort en ascension, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee of Ethics of the funeral, insists on the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the stages of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which relates to the "expression of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without pain in some northern and Protestant countries, still badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprevoiser la morte.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which limited attempts to appropriate it.
To learn the cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with an burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"Since ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the resurgence of ashes," observed Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, which proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to link it to others, to evoke it, to give meaning to his death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony teachers are often people who have been converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium of Father Lachaise has been organizing, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted to the attention of those who would not be able to travel.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
A La Seyne, the rat-caused relocation turns to polemic
At the beginning of the week, a family left its apartment on the ground floor of the Fructitor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Southern Habitat Lands Office proposed, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to accommodate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken an exaggerated proportion, says Joël Canapa, the director of the Office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The deratification undertaking carries out two steps per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our charge, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood isn't left behind, and rats don't crawl into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratification products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, one child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the ground and expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange is down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up decreasing Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quota has fallen from the dollar to the yen, which is detrimental to the export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix dropped 11,23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped from more than 11% to 1 668 yens.
A house preying on flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than thirty firemen were fired at 9 Hébert Street.
The flames were declared in a three-storey house on four floors located behind the court of the Quebec Seminary.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firemen, who were numerous to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has been perpetuated over the years, until more recently taken over by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the posters emerged in Carolines, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", an evening of comedy and music for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Several of this year's festival's actors are presented in non-traditional circuits, such as shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lascif of the FXX channel) and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still more known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a singular voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a complete film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he broadcast on TV Land, which was called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the City Hotel, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he would come down a alley between two buildings and say, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
Oil price continues to fall and is approaching $96 barrel
Oil prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the gourmet Chinese electricity manufacturing sector is being strengthened.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell from $14 cents to $96.24 at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, showing a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been experienced for two decades in the previous quarter.
The raw Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Remembrance of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal has reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and widely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice GIVs will have to have a "privilege of admission" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a hospital nurse, to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
IRG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a judge of first instance had estimated on the eve of the coming into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the position of governor, asked the Court of Appeal to annul the court of first instance's ruling that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has managed a return to strength, alongside audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates attended the hearings of this 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the Pero André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored at this first bonus.
Like every year, the first audition shows are a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want entertainment, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some found their account there.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's monitoring and search program on Thursday and dismissed the case.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has appealed its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case as it violated the judge's code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly due to a series of interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to court critics.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
She has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in areas where the greatest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons whose case was rejected after police control.
The city's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
Control and search tactics have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic men.
Judicial action was initiated in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and has become collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the NYPD control and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, allow more effective police forces to be trusted, and will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without diminishing the crime, would represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of pressured police forces after the police force was severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to constitutional control and search practices, but that it reformed the way in which the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters have to vote because each of them pays an average of $100 a month on the housing price that goes to the City for taxes.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase our rents to help us pay for the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, plots of $4 million to $5 million for if...
Let's vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef cook of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of Elyseen kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook took every step until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and feeding an incalculable number of great men in this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the hour of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, scratched skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!" ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for which he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"He is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses menus," he recalls.
"Ms Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Do not dislodge to Heads of State who posted a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all gourmets," says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had, of course, "a somewhat more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "he's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal he doesn't like".
The current Head of State, who returned the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners in the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before that is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand there were any mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysee, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a brush in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said commendations.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been for the past seventeen years at the Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in the Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-room building, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms from the fire service.
The fire was declared forward, but it rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Fire Protection Service of Quebec, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The house was housed in four houses, but no tenant was on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was very limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of the crime, but the swords have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets some pictures of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is incarnate by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will cut you off in his sloppy trade role.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange Broker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast case of corruption on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chaines parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in any kind are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
Looks like the movie finally lasts 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate in the fair race to the Oscars.
Coulson used telephone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to attempt to confirm a drum pipe on a link involving the Minister of the Interior at that time, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack the Pawlby voice box and "put up permanently in front of her door," but Coulson also called her and left her vocal messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor-in-chief, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to love presenting history to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate issues: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say, "Of course we do."
The rumours about a liaison involving Clarke were first taken up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said to her, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which were recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer concerning Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Miss Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have overseen the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's minor facts and gestures.
In a vocal message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow, which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr.Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to conspire with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted that they had made telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The US President was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013 in search of help from the United States to fight the greatest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most deadly month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November, by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher record of 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and extensive military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the American troops were withdrawn, the level of violence caused a new outbreak to be feared while neighbouring Syria was in the midst of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of political marginalization and of being the target of unjust arrests, has encouraged this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected representatives of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing to him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a ughour group of the attack of Tiananmen
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused on Friday a group of Xinjiang Uighurs separatists of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in downtown Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, sank into the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call that province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are driven by independent demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong TV channel Phoenix.
"The group that was behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, his remarks being taken over by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of ughourous origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican probes for contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican is undertaking a major survey around the world of how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage ties.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the consent of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in a proper way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebellion Fed · Global Voices
The unreducibles of the M23, some hundreds of combatants, were cut off at nearly 2000 metres altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It has not ceased since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," said a Jomba resident, attached by telephone at around 12:30, and said that a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has declined a little," he added, "it seems that the RDC's FARDC Armed Forces have pushed the rebels a little back."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "refit operation".
There was a clear sense behind him of the cracking of light weapons.
De Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place of the rebellion that took place on Wednesday, a journalist from the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting entered "in a final phase", with FARDC "enclosing the M23 residual positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in the areas of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, were on their way to the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, post-border with Uganda, soldiers aided by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a FARDC nine flaming truck, in order to secure the resurgence of another device to the positions of the M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called Wednesday night again the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" under the penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without result for the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only left to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without the information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which refutes Kigali and Kampala.
Nord-Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil is full of convoked mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement back to the DRC which started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to get back together," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including one infant on the back.
We have the impression that the shootings are getting closer to the populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
Music comedy, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, singing and dancing productions take their place.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found his voice.
It is a revolution: the musical to the French asserts itself as a successful genre.
Longtime, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts were hindered in the ridiculous.
And successes such as Cabaret or The Miserables carried the aureole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman's life.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first, this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world-wide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the helm of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of musicals" and lecturer at the Châtelet Theatre, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard to conquer.
How do French musicals evolve?
The supply has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to producers...
Some use beautiful picture projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old hijacker on the pretext that you can use anything when you have Matt Pokora in the head of a poster.
After that, we have musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us relive Broadway's golden age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them to French.
Independent French producers try a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "Spring Awakening" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like Broadway singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talents is as significant as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show, it is the assurance of an engulfment of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise is set up in Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
Serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring in Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5.30 p.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
The driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of it.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9:00 a.m., at the point of the accident, as long as the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not result in any bottlenecks as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this exit/inlet of the ring.
A severely injured child in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Caribbean Pirates".
She's been shut down until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Attack · Global Voices
Children play on a carbonized armored shield that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in the eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault against the last rebel bastions of the M23 near Bunagana in the eastern DRC.
The aim is to dislodge the M23 from the hills that overlap Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
It will only remain the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," the Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken up on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred unreducibles of the M23, are removed close to 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, an inhabitant who had reported very close fights Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were injured, including a strike, evacuated by the FARDCs, added this witness cited by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no account of the loss of human life.
The revelations of the NSA increase the paranoia of enterprises in respect of state supervision
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over at low altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation led to an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of U.S. Intelligence, again insisted in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "fly the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who has become a whistleblower, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director by word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency espioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. Cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused business paranoia in relation to state surveillance.
The revelation that German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says BITMi President Oliver Grün, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States poses a risk as important as China in the case of industrial spying and theft of data, according to an investigation published in July by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern about the lack of sufficient IT and Internet capacity in the EU and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company of software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that thought that China was the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is occurring in cloud computing, as European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members gave up their plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the US Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, says: "Our customers today ask us a question that they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction?".
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the company producing BASF chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in the event that this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB drive at a professional salon or leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the car manufacturer's board Audi, states that the collection of mobile phones prior to board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV in Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during their trips abroad due to the risk of harm to the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their own niche.
" SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic spying activities carried out by other countries.
The National Estimated Intelligence (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of having committed acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, thought that their son had been murdered.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in his high school gymnasium, think that their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta to Georgia, was found on January 11 trapped in a treadmill standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contests these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, counsel representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought that he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think that this challenges all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a letterbox and they were handed him over to them in a mortar bag," he added.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance footage that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC issues advice on child allergy to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage food allergies for children in school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, since the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States are now suffering from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize teachers and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen self-injector being the most commonly used – in order to respond quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have spinaphrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like I'm a tongue-bitter," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tongue-bittering."
The NSA case underlines the total absence of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the conflicting attitude of the French government, which, on one side, goes public in summoning the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other, bans the flight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on his board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response on the part of the French government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the ambassador of the United States, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by US diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the American power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to indignant ourselves of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we turn away from American collaboration?
The development of ten years of highly powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for cooperation and exchanges of almost daily information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the Tribal Areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools, that the question of the total lack of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the question of violations of freedoms.
What do the United States really risk?
We have denounced them, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk faced by the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit in their state, have been monitored.
That is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have grown.
Another effect may be more cost-effective: more and more European or South American companies refuse, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the NSA's power.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations by media around the world, which helps to spark a debate on the practices of monitoring intelligence services until then almost non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed rigidly to their birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make precipitated decisions regarding reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex individuals.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, contusioned and bald.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 babies each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, the intersexuality of the sixty group of diseases diagnosed as disorder of sexual development, a generic term designating individuals with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovary or testicular) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a sexual identification specialist, said the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
The intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely severe diseases that require surgery, but it is not the case of most children," he added.
It is possible to do a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It is like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young non-compliant boys now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial, allowing her to keep a "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this land-based Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is drawn into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, an infant's mother also told Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The parent role is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely ten years ago, the medical community considered gender as a slate, which can be erased and on which one can redraw.
But now, many are those who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual resignation when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the genre malleable.
He dedicated the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a circumcision to have him cast entirely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a daughter.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this pattern".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say "that they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She had female hormones taken at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing testosterone enough for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breast removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of the intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director General of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "calls for labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex name."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
German law concerns the allocation of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammogram specialist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law will "fear" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and intern in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or bearing mothers.
"The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a period before they enter "male" or "female".
Thus, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush into surgery that's irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is necessary," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and it is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confiding in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition near the Senate's vote to overturn Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left centre leader says that he "closely intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The Italian Parliament's High Chamber will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where there are more adversaries than supporters, decides to dismiss him.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last his refusal to give in to the Berlusconi injections that already wished to drop the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an officer of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to an appeal stating "multiple injuries".
"Order forces are on the scene," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said AFP a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a brink, and a second was transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 a.m. local (12.30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport was also specified.
The Los Angeles Times states that the 2 and 3 sites are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was not able to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tanks fired a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist on Thursday and injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting has erupted in this region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and have been targeted by your firing of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, which was dug up at the border and which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered falling Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event that appears in Mark Halperin's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book and John Heilemann's "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's avoidance could help Obama to re-election while his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of the Jonathan Martin Times, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the senior leaders of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the vote.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been wildly kept within the Chicago Campaign headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina and former advisors to the White House David Axelrod and David Pluffe – knew the change was under way.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, "Lord, what can we do?".
While Daley called the "concierged" exam, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot in finding out if the change would be beneficial during the poll.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at that time was aware of the possible refurbishment.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" for Obama to have known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama did not know that Biden's rejection of the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin answered.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous snack.
He had this idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it licks, the more it becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed opportune to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice I have created because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The experimental society of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual fragrances of ice such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
The ice uses fluorescent properties of the meduss synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while exercising tai chi, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands as a musician who broke the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before she died to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the wonderful joy of living he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and disguise ourselves to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become a bit thinner.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I certainly won't do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallant sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 Md in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises should represent $1.2Md out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men from Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most wanted disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great wonder, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't squeeze.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9M in candy this year, according to Nielsen's firm.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, bats, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg are sold to Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
That's about 9 billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet come to elucidate.
Nothing representative of Halloween is more than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to the Haunts America, and this includes these formidable photos of you pissing on your friends that you put on Facebook and that you can't take away and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
Well, let's talk pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citruille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "trick-baby trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and didn't have to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The frontal pumpkins that flutter softly on the porch of your house probably came from the Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more noticeable, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will set up an in-house "bad bank" structure comprising £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its rerivation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet over the next two years and hopes that it will have completely cleaned up the balance sheet over the next three years.
RBS also said it would enter a provision for depreciation of the additional doubtful receivables of four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter, a scripture related to the constitution of the cantonation structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its capacity to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would be able to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of engaging in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said the new CEO Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point bucket seats and belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options, include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Chief Executive Officer at Bowler Motorsport, said, "Rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raiding rallies.
We had a lot of fun to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firemen were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, a cocker's Spaniard, escaped after a road accident without gravity.
She was identified three days later by a person who walked her dog stuck in the career
The firemen came down in reminders along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to safely recover it while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable cliff level.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker, escaped after an accident at the road Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday.
His owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old Becky Hall girlfriend, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately looked for their lost dog and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career after a serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m., a sharp-looking person who was walking his dog found Ruby on a corniche in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton's firehouse ran to the scene and went down to rescue Ruby using an animal cider to carry her up the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies later.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said, " Ruby was very lucky to get away with it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax in West Yorkshire said, "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and passed out, she would probably have fallen.
The firemen were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall but she didn't move."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never fucked Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was chorist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he fucked me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger representative said that he "denied categorically making advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charters this week.
Beijing Challenges Turkmen Islamic Movement · Global Voices
"The backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security chief at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video released Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), was speaking in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a special organization after the attack on Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family of the dominant Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several countries of Central Asia, rushed their petrol cans-loaded car against the entry of the Prohibited City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, a former Chinese Xinjiang name, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish people a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are told that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the Hadrian wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and that was to be expected).
Neither has anyone said that the EU Member States spend a large part of their time bypassing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession which Brussels could offer in return for all that it wants from Scotland.
So this is a story that is not a story.
And a story so ancient that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard saying that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten one interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's play against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a dead end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Through Europe, parties that oppose the EU or militate for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euroceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the carcan heavy on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments which are experiencing excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has made it difficult for its members to maintain the exchange rates favourable to German exporters – which German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of South Europe face an intrinsic problem of productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public wages and expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a greater concern about productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-recognition drawback, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All wage gels in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the growing revolt, particularly in France, is one of the main factors in the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in a bad way.
Result: the extreme right-wing party of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists back to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – an opportune warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-European anti-money bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-money sentiment unique in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like "the Europe of the Nations (Sovereigners)" free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending for a walk in Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal UN Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is to be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that has best succeeded in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Equiquier, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing earlier
Studies show that Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent.
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys.
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair begin to grow at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassureing parents – in general, it doesn't indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real emergence of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something that a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and a small size at adult age.
Drug and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on the child's age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that "controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others".
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter had her first ten-year-old rules.
Although there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frightened and troubled school to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6-9 who linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early pubicity is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians participating in the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true emergence of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation sooner than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it occurs earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The homage to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that just began to resonate before Bob Dylan's arrival.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinema Library, had taken the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen trio, they threw their devolu on the star rise of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous movie where music is a central character and songs played live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be a accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich moods in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less bright clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jury owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't get through and is angry with the whole earth.
He agreed to remove the foot replacements raised in the studios.
Without housing, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
Documentary Air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but an integral, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Runk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would give rise to international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Runk's, wrote.
The film then takes on documentary gourds, 33T's invading dusty music label inhabited by an old, impatisible secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character that passes through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with cracking eyes, fortune companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about the way he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "danger can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise everything on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let yourself be trapped by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word "retire."
Pénomene de l'edition française, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as "the author of spy novels who knew too much about it".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th theatres of the famous series of spy novels.
Decreased physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also gone to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured that he ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, about a half century ago.
" Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million all countries," he advanced last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building of Foch Avenue just a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 painted countries to locate his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with the advantageous breast, wearing a gun or a rifle of assault.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an ardent Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launched himself to the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a lot of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters of the Albert London type, who went to the scene and came back with real, long investigations."
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical leaf."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," said Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
Thus, many of its SAS are often pre-monitoring: so, one month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime, having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Path of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "Cair's Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in Panic in Bamako, he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists that were based on the capital of Mali.
I am not divine, I defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips in often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 Marguerite IBM typewriter "where all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and pictures of the author with African warlords are attached to the walls of his office.
Regularly pushed for machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers ruled out these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes quarrel about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages among the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautical lounge that takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the seats proposed on long-haul flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard with a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing said it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute has erupted as the aircrafters seek to sell even larger versions of their long-haul bimotor aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its refurbished "777X" can accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be set up with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the concurrent version of its A350 will transport 350 people into 18-inch seats in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai aeronautical lounge, where the 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in smaller seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Airbus Commercial Director.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats on planes have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the turning point of the century, the average American weight of 40-49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the average American of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a concept of seat dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the freshly named "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus added that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus' numbers regarding the width of seats and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute there is a race at the command of aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 Md at market price in the coming decades, enough to weigh the balance of American and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest models of long-run bimotors 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's announced performances depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this to be able to house more seats and make its planes more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passenger at the European airliner Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go in pairs with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the insider of Mary Kirby's cabins, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a list of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aeroplane vendors who tour the world take even a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet been sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that its call to the aeronautics industry to set up a size standard for seats would result, but that it could make it forget the sales wave of 777X.
Oracle Shareholders Irritated by Ellison's Wages
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aureolade from the victory of his boat at the Cup of America, has become dull.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year Ellison had already had a negative vote on his pay.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but it received approximately $77 million in stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the whole of the delayed year 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5%, while the Bond Exchange course by 27.5%, over-performing the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Other tests are needed before testing the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods now available in the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a regular stream of antibodies.
Antibodies trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having a dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothed," said the researchers, sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective as they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remain high that they are too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into an antibody plant.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addition to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but reported that much more extensive research was needed.
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a US drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, and was learned from security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in this strike, conducted in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
Yesterday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British Government that discussions had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi nee to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the government's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a café, after its expiry in August 2005, without having any tender.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has put pressure on leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported to Obeid approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without any tendering.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tender.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, admitted Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to IACC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's command in the Department of Fisheries.
"The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial lease policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but in any case, that wasn't it.
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity test"
The government is currently exploring the possibility of establishing a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa while considering extending law enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a hijacked means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government speech on foreign workers, saying that he could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Failing statements about "foreign returnees" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions demanded a secure labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artifact.
The working paper describes the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is authentic in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or partnership of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The drowning son of the man, nine years old, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baroness Kramer said the project "would bring together the United Kingdom".
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was "excited" with the idea of working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6M.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the journey time for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for a maximum of three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a problem of the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "unequivocally" Scotland's inclusion in HS2.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British Ministers next year and we will then decide on the next steps together."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. gesture to ease regulation of electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining the decision that US carriers are required to do important work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft by aircraft," she said.
The issue is regulated by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas said she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely examine the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand baggage transportation programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will require passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances, and a gathering of about 30 people according to the testimony gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rickshaw involving several people burst out on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be deplorable.
Allegedly, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken over.
Singaporean Lending Loans Take advantage of the medium classes forced to tighten the belt
At a lender in the Bendemeer mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga has a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for the tuition fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is so in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households increases – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third lending company on guarantee to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
Guaranteeing jewelry is not just a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms.Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's secured lenders receive an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, secured lenders have the advantage of not asking for solvency verification or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders at a standstill while families feel the pressure exerted by increased cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the low-market credit fuelled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to lenders on bail to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the increasing debt of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest debt ratio of Asian households/gross domestic product.
Malaysia is leading the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to reap their personal effects to reach the cash value of their jewels.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items earned in the 200 state-of-the-art lending shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's set the chain in granny's gold and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest provider of retail stores, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the lending sector that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have failed to criticize the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that winning not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Gaining is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of securing short-term guaranteed funding.
Also, those who visit lenders are not only those with financial problems.
Affluent people from Singapore also go to the valuemax bookshops to get gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It can be wealthy people who need short-term borrowing for business activities or investments, or small businesses who have cash needs to go a difficult way," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was caring for young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was officiated, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not contact persons under 18 years of age or access to the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a cross with a scavenger cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, clients having complained to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it comes, it had already left unscathed," she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who looked upset.
People were nice mouths.
"You don't go out on the street this way unless you want to get the attention," a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black armband SS twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining that he suffers from "mental problems".
Rescue plan of $325 million for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the vacillating health system has strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year funding was decided after consultations with the government with the Independent Member of Parliament in Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Ms.Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgery.
2,600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-recurrent clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical professionals, mental health services, and deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, it is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system," said Ms.Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and reporting regime.
The State will have to maintain current levels of funding to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system".
However, he congratulated the Government on having responded to his request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal assistance plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the opposition spokesman for health care Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "fortuitous solution".
"The reason we're here is that the state labor government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a government of the state that pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth puts in $300 million, and pretends it's a hot day.
Mr Dutton visited Ms.Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel stands out from a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
As she was in France in the 1760s, she told the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced cruelty with no blemish of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubrication or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the surveillance agency
Syria destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline for the
November 1 fixed by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious time frame for destroying Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29 954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, 18 678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah activists.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
The Assad troops have been fighting against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while having to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within a tight period of time.
A statement by the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now pleased to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the critical production declared and the machines intended for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being".
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first step of the audit work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and...that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OPCW Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a sharp explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Clergy caused by the sentence handed down against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing being one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks targeting two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges relating to terrorism, including a wave of attacks targeting churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for a life sentence, yet they could have asked the man, who is called "Demilition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the edge of the tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged before the execution platoon," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without other grandchildren, or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23:00 on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He submerged into the coma the day after the attack and became unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times when he was under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in order to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was mocking at the loss of grief that he had been able to cause to others.
The verdict was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks to be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of weeping this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new highly expected guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft complies with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and the rules for the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them up before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft before landing and not turn them off until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground handling, FAA said.
Most of the new line aeroplanes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said he was happy with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," said Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was driven out loud from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And the heavier devices like laptops will always have to be lined up because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile telephone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow for a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were transporting FM radios, the high-tech gadget at that time.
New line aeroplanes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more responsive to interference.
The vast majority of line aeroplanes should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of power much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those that pressurize restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders commissioned a Kindle electronic book reader line aircraft and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he thought interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that the aircraft may interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their devices during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling for meaningful arrangements for travellers with technologies.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitre bird from a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild
A bird, helitreilled after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig, was released into nature.
The water stream was mounted aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was released on foot by the Scottish PSC in its rescue center in Alloa.
The head of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This river of water was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring business together and define what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the broadest and most comprehensive investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to engage in the long and difficult process of reforming the European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from regulating monopolies to product laws – most business leaders believe that controlling these key competences should go back to Westminster.
The single market has led to general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large, traditionally the most pro-European, companies are even in agreement.
Finally, and even more so, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the world of the company insists on a "significant change" that gives power back to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – to change the Treaty and to better represent Britain's interests would make it possible to see 16% of the votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed comic books to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the fêtards got caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy people, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan feast celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that the Bulgarian pipeline is opening a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
"A historic event has taken place today: Construction has begun in the Bulgarian side of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Gazprom's CEO, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should be able to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart from Ukraine, which passes most of the Russian gas for Europe, increases the level of risk in relation to conventional channels, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
Pitcairn Island wishes to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the Daily The Tahiti News, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English navy which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly of the mutiny descendants of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on London's generosity 95%.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this application.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would enable the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, near Pitcairn.
The FAA fulfils the restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but calls on mobile phones will always be prohibited.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, in northeastern China, was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million bribe yuan, reporting the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and managers obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first interim court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as inviable with the powerful "stigres" as with the "mouches" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former officials of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former PCC chief at Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having held the highest positions in the state.
But the government has not demonstrated any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assaults following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations against the Caringbah educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization”.
Director General Phillip Hare was interviewed about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had heard of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out that "external controls of YMCA have been carried out and indicated that child safety is an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of child security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings to protect children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, had them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she found the head of the YMCA Child Services Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord messed up their judgment, which meant that they did not report their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his point of view before the YMCA Council of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not relate to "reporting" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff of confidentiality agreements signed shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA Director General for Child Services Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return to the Prime Minister, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a special envoy to the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it could probably happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to confront and win the trophy of the Year Horse, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee have trotted during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presented against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a casual way to parade his 2 year old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training since with his pony Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo."
They presented themselves against and against all, but the gold and rosette cut off.
It was only the second time he had conquered with Toffee and we were mad at the joy that he won.
On the runway, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from Nantyglo village, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He travelled the entire length of the track in the current and even if it seemed to be small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
In the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the manifestation of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will make a beautiful performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they paraded on the runway.
They are looking for an effective team between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal "will be refurbished"
A Chinese newspaper that called on the front page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be refurbished, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But then Mr. Chen admitted to television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "full refurbishment," the regulator said.
The order of "refurbishment" comes from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express’s writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete refurbishment of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately remand the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper issued a call on the front page twice for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
As a result of Mr. Chen's apology, New Express made his first-page apology, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made TV confessions.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to criminalize himself.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear warheads in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "no danger to the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, specialist of the naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched in the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among other things, it is about changing a pump on the defective boiler.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make his deployment planned by the end of 2013," DCNS explains.
And the National Navy to certify that "cade does not call into question the vessel's program of activity" with nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier leaves a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, among other things, is to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the reactor's containment space, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to potential radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax deluge, all kinds of permits costs, administrative expenses not to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money removed from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not bother about the sumptuous spending and maintenance of wood ducks: cultural center deficit, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private enterprise or demolish them.
It is also disturbing to note the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not the public level to invest in such enterprises, but rather the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that lakes in the Fishery and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large population decline, water use has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation as to its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I should be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I don't think a sheep breeder would do worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico on its own track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own systems of lighting, ventilation and electric rails, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4 foot-by-three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag along an equivalent length to nearly six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal the trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by unnoticed passing, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with marijuana possession and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to life imprisonment for 10 years if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that left the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to a police station, adding that if he did not do so, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible channels under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, calling for political asylum for this country in South America.
Scotland Yard "issued a surrender notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Do you finish typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even estimates that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet .
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this commitment to biometrics, but worry about it.
In 2011 and in France alone, the National Commission on Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, hand-shaped or venous network of hands in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified anywhere and anytime," says Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will build on new technologies that will enable new services to be made available to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and venous networks of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the hand contour assume a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - it is not possible to capture these data themselves - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and it takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for some twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
Thanks to increased sensor accuracy and the computing capacity of computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture R&D Laboratories in Europe, calculates.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible marking, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the present state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vultiet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognize one person among others) and authentication (make sure the person is the one that he claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issue of identity papers: we must compare the biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) with the information that the state has on all citizens already filled.
This makes it possible to ensure that one person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We take back the surveillance camera images and compare them to the photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for the commercial development of biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a quidam photo that does tail in a store, track its progression through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the partner that points to another", justifies Cyrille Bataller, from Accenture.
But more and more authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the strike of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and stores of the large distribution: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader scanning the veins.
Experimentation is planned for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracking to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometric seductive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in caisse for thirty seconds less, it is significant," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of extensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy experts, they, continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me afraid of the worst: widespread surveillance," says Andrew Patrick of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was inflicted a £1,000 order
A motorist was fined $1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink set in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree to Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a surcharge for a 100-pound victim.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to break the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally encrypted the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in Budget 2012, has registered a stamp duty of 7% for properties that cost more than £2 million and annual expenses for buyers who choose to own property in a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp fee already applies to the residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea district, and represents £708 million over the 2012/13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, the Northwest and Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on the matter, it is very difficult to move forward that high value properties are subject regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous area south-west of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London show steady year-to-year growth of 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%), with a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs are more likely to move their tails to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs are more likely to move them to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers have followed animals watching movies where other dogs were.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films where other dogs were – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an unexpressed dog move the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view, which removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail turning mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view that stirs the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or shouldn't worry about.
He added: "If you encounter several other dogs on several occasions and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the dog species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when their tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robots dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it probably won't take long before we understand why their tail moves sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band reported a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with its singer.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to take place on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that he cannot perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket office where you bought your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is therefore a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as he needed to ensure that the number of cardinals elected reaches 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The consistory of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
For the time being, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine the ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"From now on, Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "all possible" that François asked for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never known such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities in the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we do not know who he will name".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat records
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually tilting records, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. agency responsible for regulating vehicle safety.
On some pickups, front seats could present a defect in the tilting mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models recalled were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM's pickups started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM advised the owners of the fault pickups during the first fortnight of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the halt of 16 days of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock exchange rate rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York stock exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama took place around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on foundations has been going on in this place for some time.
A mitoyen foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collide with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the yard.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the 50 who worked for a coffering company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Labour Health and Safety was sent to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of an Obamaian elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts by the Obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a horribly sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's about memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients in the evening and when I lie down, this book reminds me of the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could blow you away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries moved towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82 per cent favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Oussama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer explain myself.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor can the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdemeanours.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the overexpenditure of authorized expenses during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict previous political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, like Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and slightly refined alternative that did not seem to allow for the determination of his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term, having freed himself from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that have been heard for so long.
However, while the index of favourable opinions has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses to Clinton's benefit from the Pennsylvania Primaires.
During a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to refocus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are five years later, Mr President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, about 15 hours, a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place on rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The 26-year-old, Jonathan, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters may be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument in an attempt to dispel issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's girls were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she obtains leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a refurbishment of the suffrage collection system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take on his new functions "very seriously".
Public service is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for rewards, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of bald dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Milieus (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of douphin?
It's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
Although in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
Moreover, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or membership of a species to a genus, family, or even order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences among species.
Today, some of these classifications are called into question because of the progress of genetics.
In the same way, two species very near morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-family: Pacific-backed dolphins and Atlantic-backed whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had long been known by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present here.
Therefore, if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral epidemic or by accidental capture occurs in the region, we may have to deal with the extinction of a species, rather than local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered on the basis of the number of individuals existing on Earth, that is, the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from its neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species was discovered, its stock automatically became smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Marianne pit, only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research, and it's a long time since it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division from two sources close to the file, showing once again that the global regulators' investigation into the suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperated with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where 5.3 billion US dollars are changing hand every day.
Both traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of the Libor interbank rate manipulations.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said one bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had sent email and instant mail files, sent to and from a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European Cash Trading Manager at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European currency broker at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, a senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said he was investigating suspicions of exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine allegations made regarding bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rate rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicating sources close to the file.
Banks hide instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News on these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines in investment banks trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid foreign exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal exchange platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost".
The news came the same day that Crédit Suisse announced that he had sent a trader working in his London Stock Exchange office this week after he lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been mastered," said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been clogged, says a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation "so clogged".
Ruby told La Presse Canadienne that the police had "informed or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and driver, Alexander Lisi, who was 35, and accused him of being extorted in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
My Ruby described as "unexplained" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair had knowingly chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and searched - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Mr Ruby's remarks as "obvious and desperate attempt" to assert himself to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges in decline in the mid-term, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are moving downwards on Friday at mid-session, plummeted by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street are in a hurry to open up U.S. actions after two consecutive recovery sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest relapsing of CAC 40, plumbed by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published results down this morning and announced the creation in-house of a "bad bank" deficit structure comprising 38 billion of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2,45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that AT&T is studying a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is good, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, points out.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to refute against the US currency and has hit in the sitting less than two weeks at $1,3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's health system reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the law of reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the law on the protection of the sick and affordable care) – which requires citizens to undergo health insurance by 2014, with the penalty of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government's power of taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Act by 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold should be lowered to Medicaid on the penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The process of blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in high school during the 2012 primary elections, including the candidate named Mitt Romney, have strongly opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to Veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli rapprochement at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday, October 31, 2013 in the evening during a violent docking at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip has ceased to operate on Friday, November 1 after a depletion of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shelling during an Israeli army raid to the east of Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 metres inside the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who have fallen defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant to Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesman.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and destined, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to combat Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military press release explained.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said the spokesman for the Peter Lerner army.
Israel also struck an aerial military base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Shiite Hezbollah movement, reported the Al-Arabiya satellite channel on Thursday 31 October.
One US official confirmed an "Israeli Strip" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing the "exclusive sources" she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing targeted a shipment of air-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of medical activists and sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents in Danse Danse his two new group choreography: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henry Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, of profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a thread of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only the hands and faces discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next spelling appears, incarnate it, come out in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in group with unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where everyone executes his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the fore-scene.
It's the same principle, big PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the carpet of dance, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monoton in the cry, and will continue in dancing.
And the music to go away, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if it can, ends up deafening and clogging.
As is also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hairs that are plowing or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, imposed himself, with his tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt's shapes, open a wider and gibious imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers crushed by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopédies, after the entanglement, are richer.
The scene is partially lined with gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a behind house.
At the piano, dancers were hooking up to play the scores.
Their misrepresentations in music, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, couples pass through, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Groupwork, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, flying the red nose, in very polarized male-female loving parades.
Loves are carpenters, fugitives or players.
The gestures, laughter and small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coitus, beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back to the scene when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play the codes of applause, spread the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents initiated an avalanche of judicial patent proceedings on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, notably Google, the company that it coifted at the post at the auction of patents that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5M, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Auditors in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in relation to search terms on the Internet, indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to contact the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million offer for Nordl's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer 4.4 Md$.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 Md, a market in part based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in issue during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents," the conclusions of the trial indicated.
Rockstar claims more damages and interests against Google, as he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
Grandma would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her five-year-old granddaughter, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday night the King's prosecutor's substitute.
The expert sent on site by the Parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned lighter.
"The two victims were intubated and heavily conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU de Liège, she in an ambulance, she said," said Mayor José Paulet, who went down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were re-located by the president of the CPAS.
The Andenne and Namur firemen and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls upon the first freely elected President to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi has sworn to invest, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he pledged the oath of investiture to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his investiture in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the 18 judges in the black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better days, a new Egypt and a second republic," President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and harshly suppressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, beginning with the Presidential Fast of the Mubarak years, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of its convoy in the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic "resistance wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech in which he has tried to stand as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges present in the woodwork room where he took an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." sunk by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and vowed to recover the presidential powers whose military council, which replaced the former President, dismissed him.
But by agreeing to officially swear before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is of use, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
US shutdown slowed the car market up
The 16-day closure of most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers, five of the six main ones with lower performance than expectations.
Detroit's three major builders have two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized sales and seasonally adjusted, but the market was 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the customers of the bank, it considers that this slight brake stroke is primarily due to the government 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first half of the month.
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% in its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of his pick-ups, saw his sales progress from 14% in one year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For his part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have sales below consensus, despite increases over one year of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM won 1.4% at 16h35 GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.
Renault plumbed in Bourse by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses Friday the strongest decline of the SBF 120 index in Paris after its Nissan Motor partner announced that it has decreased its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, reporting traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a revision, also announced a change of direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's warning profit," says one responsible for trading a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to the data of the Nissan website.
Greece: Two deaths in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday evening by gunshots fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing by a place in the golden neo-Nazi party Aube in the western suburb of Athens, learned from a police source.
The police were not in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had argued that the victims were local guards.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service deployed on the central avenue of Néo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurs a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Aube MPs, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal dismissed and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club's Champions League, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for having sent a blow to Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club was said to be "very disappointed," believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15,042 black subscribers, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The great region of Montreal also knows its lot of failures with nearly 7,000 power-free homes in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to overturn the trend.
The company has revised its net-benefit forecast upwards and expects record results from the holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize a underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8% of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results on the whole of the year before interest and tax deduction," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate for a small-down domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's recreational travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year, where seasonal demand was lower and had to profit from the year as a whole for the third consecutive period.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Caught strangers opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without victimizing it, resulting in an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The assailants fled, specified the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, Police General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt is almost no longer receiving any tourists since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi from early July and suppressed in blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature classes, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A combined course of literature and English language will be deleted.
As of 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
On the other hand, Ofqual, the Examinations Regulatory Office, will unveil a redrafting of the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our screening system to restore public confidence," stressing that CSEGs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students offer about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance of international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The programme will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and widely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the banks of the Muy visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid of.
His gun was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured on a large daily basis using archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great riddles of the postwar War.
The German secret services, the BND, ensured as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former ministry of the Aviation du Reich by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
"In the left inner pocket were in particular his states of service with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the town hall of the Mitte neighbourhood in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the neighbourhood.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, declared himself shocked by this revelation.
If one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it's an enormous taste of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is crudely crowded from the foot," he instilled in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the leading figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the "Heros CNN of the year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the remaining sequels of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years escorting his father to hospitals and clinics, so he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," added Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 physician per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditures are incurred in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't take advantage of life.
After seeing his father and fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 surgical acts for free last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they get into vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrains to get to the villages that need the most help.
Chances don't always follow.
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy slopes.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people at each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bees, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical actions under local anesthesia.
The operations are generally performed in a school, city hall or house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an impressive pace, but the musicians in the villages generally help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he said, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer at Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr.Bwelle in his missions, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help drain the blood or transfer the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in second year.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transportation and teaching are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there is no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to turning off.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and soothing pain are the reasons that motivate me to do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, the academics have long painted to define and position Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Probably, but highlighting its weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of other works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
The heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupies at the French Academy?
Certainly again, but knowing that such a sacred could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and a federator of their work, but noting that he was inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of "the places of memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a lively look and hearing, but incurably amateur.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed not to write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely render him justice.
Once again, however, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, retirement to jump as if on foot from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a fine title bring the brochanteur to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constituent node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
Here little, we were collectively invited to make a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obligated, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, interpreters authorized.
The one who chases Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not stand as heir to an eternal franchise, he refuses to define it.
An uneasy analyst of a strange family, he wanders into a forest of symbols, arrested at every step by an object in the form of rebuses, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which the company itself is born: why, in a country so permanently set up within its borders, so previously framed and solidly shaped, are these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that closes the national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without being able to deny it; worried instead of regaining its sacredness and all the more vivid of unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head to the one who was the evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, written a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But U.S. cushioning only makes it better to emphasize what is proper for us.
There were men who had left their Old Regiment in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, the burdened men of an old indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confided it.
Here are the founding fathers who are always honored, and here are the revolutionary ancestors who are hard to model, and who have fallen apart.
There is an institutional constancy, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as well as errors to catch up and trials to take over.
France leaving, France coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed that they could cover the dress torn apart from their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
In this third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who were then employed to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France made the modern France absolutely clear and offering them a unified version of their history.
But that peaceful identity had only one time.
Here it is again in debate, driven by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demand-seeking minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, first, the portrait of the historian, who should book a few surprises.
We find out that the fireplace was a married couple.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The roller shutter was located in the centre of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but had subtracted himself from the initiatic exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, as grano salis, that he would have done it.
Certainly in a less steep, brighter and more subtle form.
But let us not mistake it, just as binding.
For much more than the figure imposed by the university degree, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is complex enough to manage"
Took off in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation in 2004 of the Association of Defense of the Hostages of the World, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained over 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observatore" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the stage of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and you tell me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're putting us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive on the website of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French people take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there in a helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Easter embarks.
How did your arrival on French soil take place?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible buffalo.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back and there's plenty of them.
The descent down the stairs of the plane, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves out to make pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do some police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clear.
We're getting out of a hole and we're all under media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to handle.
But we did the toughest thing.
Evening, I'm at 8:00, and the next day I'm on TV.
Then a sort of recovery to life begins, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like vacation.
How did medical examinations and debriefing take place?
I had the right to first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on it, remember it if need be, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage-takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Niger hostages?
I hear what they say.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things make me nervous, others less.
I'm trying to do the part between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the "World hostages" association that allows me to distance myself, and it seems much more interesting to approach.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a problem with semantics.
It is necessary to qualify the taking of hostages as "political" - most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why don't you say to the hostage-takers, "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, founded, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce the trial of Morsi
Incredible anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
It is not a trial that emphasizes this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Until now, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial, a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, and 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 US states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal government recognized the homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with it," the Minister recalled in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism in New York.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard's facilities," he denounced, calling on them to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access to their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state fiend began with Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on the implantations of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas Act and the Federal Homosexual Marriage Act.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, including 17 000 National Guard, Reserve and Retirees.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken in place on Saturday morning starting at 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the run, at 10 a.m., before the planned final at 3 p.m. and the award at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young Heroic prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
When he was only 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he does not like to go back to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunting Journalists Coming to Ask Him About a Drug Case
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media reports.
A video handed over to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested one, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while recognizing having a pang for cannabis.
On Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28th.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological survey has been undertaken to identify and take care of those who could have contacted this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," says the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement states.
Departments now call on people who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, licked, or licked on a mucous membrane or on skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France has been rabies-free since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," the press release said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "aboriginal" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is declared officially free from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Epizootic Diseases (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," remind departments and is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama Backs Up on Health Reform · Global Voices
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health care system, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their claimants, the Republicans have criticized the President in recent days by accusing him of cheating on the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a current effervescence" about the cancellations, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-suited health care plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
"You will win," he said.
The Administration announced that it would not be surprising if the 5% of the population who self-insurance were forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me direct myself to these Americans: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony to the Washington Energy and Trade Committee.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately".
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to regaining your confidence.
She was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, on whether she should join Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has consistently asked Ms.Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to enter a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel misses a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy chosen, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the automobile brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the runway.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 World Champion, for the free trial of Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Friday, a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the rehearsals.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
One inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches his Parte de la banlieue
Let us not mistake ourselves above all.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not intended only for the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, justifying it.
When I talk about suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal No. 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, is now claimed to be "100% apolitical" even if it has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he will continue.
There are only extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -advisable on the Internet - based on many themes intended to speak to the suburban inhabitants and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the 16-year-old civilian majority, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, this may be just, he recognizes."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that he already has seven heads of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support e-mails I've received since yesterday don't all come from suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry pointed out that the U.S. defensive attitude towards its monitoring programs was softened by admitting, on several occasions, that espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate manner".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, along with Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities came to light.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government, took note of some things in an automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on September 11."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that U.S. espionage had exceeded the limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to people that he was now undertaking a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up, and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have quite well prevented falling planes, buildings from exploiting and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged US spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said the Senate Sub-Committee President on European Affairs Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken before members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration that the National Security Agency is monitoring.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in our mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first mandate, and President of the US Senate's Sub-Committee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some U.S. allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it related to the metadata that the NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations related to Snowden's disclosure that the NSA intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and those from 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified allied espionage by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was planning a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affective firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have been applying for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the grudge generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plummeted by Shell's bad results and the day after an announcement by the continued state of support for the economy, as planned.
Australia appeals for imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgement and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, along with two other men who controlled her, had assaulted him early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the history of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Department of Foreign Affairs to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously experienced a distressing moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that, in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket de Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its damaged image to tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came in otherwise than with the cars of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the Brussels-mids police area, on Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stage," the spokesperson sent.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even guards on sight," Marie Verbeke announced.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Burgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This was why, a year ago, there was consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of living together in French.
Vision diversities have been walking for a year in schools to help students from all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are benchmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are a strain or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So, projects are created so that they can identify with all of this," explains the President of Vision Diversity, Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we live in, within the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azduz of the University of Montreal will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
The research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
