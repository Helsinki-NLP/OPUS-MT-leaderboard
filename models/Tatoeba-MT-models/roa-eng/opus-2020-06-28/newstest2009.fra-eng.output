At the end of the trades, the Prague stock exchange tilts in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange recited its losses.
The transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall of the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the U.S. House vote, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is also visible to us.
Fall of Asia’s Actions
Asian scholarships experience a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the clues were successful during the day to erase some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hongkong stock exchange lost four percent during trade, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hongkong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five per cent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to his index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the rescue action in the USA will influence the financial markets around the world," notes Joseph Yam, the head of the Hongkong Monetary Office.
Although Hongkong was part of China, he established his own monetary policy, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates have the same level in Hong Kong as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the financial system support proposal.
Otherwise, it would be likely that other countries would suffer from this.
The blood bath of American actions
On Monday, the House of American Representatives rejected the financial system support project, which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Kč).
The legislators therefore reiterated the call for support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. actions are experiencing a bloodbath and the biggest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of such a size for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Ceda: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion financial assistance (about 12 trillion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not, however, certain.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Say Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the Speaker of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate a priori.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan should be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in restoring financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "delusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should have," confided to the Bloomberg Agency, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
In her view, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
On Saturday night, representatives of the legislators met with US finance minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should buy from financial companies the insale real estate assets that result in significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson says.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, do not escape Harry Reid, the legislators are making it possible for Congress to reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They wish to calm investors before the beginning of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could affect trade on Monday.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Chambers of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still have many changes.
The total amount intended for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress does not feel that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may put his veto to this decision, Congress, he, has the opportunity to put him in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the acquisition of bad real estate securities, whose value is falling, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed Sunday to the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The president of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of the contributors against losses, the discount agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides for assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly accounts of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help · Global Voices
According to Patria Finance Chief David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are not aware of the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets with problems.
This will be decisive in deciding on the loss sharing between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Marek, that.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it to it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," stressed Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually every mobile can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems to be clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the home a cheap gramophone of the highest quality to put on the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disk, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are in your shelves vinyl discs embedded, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during movements, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for one reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty supporting listeners purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifespan of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music readers are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the first functions, phone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a variable-quality camera and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fryer can grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two reloads.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy gushes.
There are few mobiles that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you get to call it from time to time, get, to be sure, a second charge for the work - this is even valid for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, following a reload, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not everyone can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers can take it without a reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need any software, except (iPod).
Simply fill the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the album title, style, or then the user's judgment.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, in the way Windows Explorer does, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, you are particularly interested in the lifetime of the accumulator, the ability of memory, the quality and type of output of sound and, of course, the ease of order.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you are enough for any mobile reading MP3.
Almost all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is capable of reading.
All are able to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of the devices can also read from the WMA music format.
The AAC (format used by Apple firm and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also enable, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator's web pages (or other provider's) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for obtaining a musical piece of furniture.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and is, in most cases, limited to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether through GSM, the Internet, or even through the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their cell phones on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have on you listeners or a handlesfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which have virtually all mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The cheapest normally costs less than three thousand.
For a prize of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very convenient.
In most cases, however, you will be constrained by the absence of an outlet for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided with an entry for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone can assure the order of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how easy the control is to approach that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobile phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went as far in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on many occasions, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed it.
As a result of the last steps taken by the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, as we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), said several times that in Czechia there was no place for another operator, chorused with operators.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network apparently has no more luck (in fact, now it will only find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable fall in prices, which should subsequently also be reacted to by conventional operators.
Yet, before the entry of the trouble parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those we hear today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we had informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns among others the U:phone in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order for their operation to be effective, they actually need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, free of relatively high building, operating and maintenance costs for the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, in Britain, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, putting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work with us as well.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesperson for Vodafone, doubtless: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As much as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in Czech Republic are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the Czech operators were not in any event in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to make every effort to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not, for a long time, concealed its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of us, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl spokeswoman.
The future is therefore perhaps promising.
According to informal information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared with others very specific.
For the time being, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not registered for now a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator would appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead, Vodafone directs his attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain his own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
The authorities responsible: in line with the operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profit.
So what good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to hear how to lanterns at the fair. Chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also demonstrates it.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTU, at the time of the creation of the U:fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This information is available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Now, today, the U:fon is willing to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "Competition in the mobile market has been further increased recently by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
In view of this problem, the latter adopts its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at this time, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously brought sufficient interest to conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, UOHS's Department of External Relations, in response to our question.
Such a statement would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreigners, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices of mobile telephone services."
However, exerting pressure in the direction of an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not part of the UOHS' interests.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which derives from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a chance, arises naturally.
In the same way, a gasoline price that is strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecommunications regulator," said Chalopa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discord.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which, from the point of view of economic competition, telecommunications constitute a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is why he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators conduct visibly in a similar manner.
However, complaints from many stakeholders (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Resuming responsibility for ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent introduction of the Telecommunications Act, a broadening of ČTU's powers in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, was not successful, although many experts promised that the situation would be improved.
That is why the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own list of prices for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partly public.
In most cases, there are companies involved in multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile phone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally only reach elected members.
The magic tower consists of the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a classic company client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it obtains special price offers (and others).
What is problematic is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you're talking about was going to happen, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to a halt in collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová answered our question.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity would have been achieved even to those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
One operator, however, does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring non-negligible profits, and at the same time, as opposed to genuine virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the way of ordinary mobile operators."
That is precisely what should seem strange to ČTU.
In addition, another question is raised at UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to confine itself to explanations from operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions forbidding it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decline in the price of services.
However, almost in all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were endeavouring, sometimes more or less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulators have intervened in developed countries, not in the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they have eventually achieved the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators address this issue in the form of a hot potato that is disposed of by transmitting it to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not touch it after the cognée.
If the background information says true and a virtual operator will soon appear at home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS can hardly remain impassable in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose Best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a chorus interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek views Czech national chant as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that both singers and the choir have a good word, so that we can understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
For the first time in 1834 Kde domov mðj resounded on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des satetiers), an original Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously made it appropriate.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
Public transport (MHD) pragonics will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragical Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will ride the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day coupon or 90-day coupon (this coupon will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it recorded on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Agency of Transportation), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can permanently forget the counters in metro stations, where they had until now to tread impatience in long tails in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon on the internet and record it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a desk with trained staff at the passenger's disposal, which will help those interested with the internet purchase and, in addition, record the coupon they bought on their card," says the spokesperson for the Martin Optrný project.
Besides libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compose the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety," Opatrný added.
An auto will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
It is in the peri-urban trains and the 300-499 bus lines, which mainly use the inhabitants of the communes of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrova doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zone validity of coupons;" explained the control of the Philip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the transport in pragal public.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated with the driver's box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but also to place the Opencard at the location indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger would need to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than to ask the driver for this information," Dápal completed.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, can rejoin automatic distributors, initially used to record coupons on the map.
This is where, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Southeasts called for a referendum in the USA
In 1945, the Germans of the Southeast called for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter from the collections of Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of South Germans allegedly approached the President of the USA with such a desire.
This is due, among other things, to a letter kept in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov asked in the letter the American President not to allow "šumavská župa" (a region of forests south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be truly sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come to the territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, "People, to whom the fate of Šumava stands."
Since the Czechoslovakia rally is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of the post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least consider that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them were given such an opportunity.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Southeasts.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of Holstein, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him for learning the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You do not think — you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Žebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from driving dangerous behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol on the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the "blooding" slogan of the entire campaign:
You do not think — you pay!
The phrase "Don't Think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a flash of blood, there's the phrase "You'll Pay."
Which must mean that one can pay for life for a moment of carelessness.
Spots will "hunter" spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images are commonly seen with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
It believes that this will lead to a reduction in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whipping strategy against drivers
"What works with the drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by gaining time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Mr. Ehud Olmert, President of the interim Israeli Government, supported the restoration of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without this, peace will not take place," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all he does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, to renounce parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
"He who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to incorporate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said later.
Withdrawal of the heights of the Golan
Olmert also supported Israel's retreat from the heights of the Golan, which he believed was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
That would also require some efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah ( Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support to Hamas terrorism ( Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as to Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Issues that arise after the accident: The stewards in why are they illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel within the coach.
"If the law was to be adhered to in a strict and formal manner, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka's spokesman.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road to the bus.
The girl was at this time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even slow down abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is on the basis of its technical data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we have addressed with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that the passengers could go to the toilet during the journey provided they had their own seat," he unveiled.
The law ignores steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the steward's role - there is no legal requirement for that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirements also prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle recipient; it does not define its rights and duties," adds the spokesman Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the road traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals with the problem sufficiently.
"Everything depends on whether the coach has in its approval the permission to offer standing seats.
Everything is in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing seats and a maximum speed of limited, interurban with standing seats and a higher permitted speed and in long distance buses without standing position with the highest authorized speed and seats equipped with safety-belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (Security of Road Traffic) in Transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
Nor is it certain when a turbulence will occur and the air hostess can form her head."
"Now, in the event that the coach had stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the security of stewards through internal requirements," he said, and he also felt that from the law's point of view, the problem was not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not regard his profession as a risky profession.
"None, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
The concern for safety is the reason why the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who, in comparison with SA, provides a very small number of lines in his vehicles.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposing them since the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has arrived.
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using flashing and it blocked the way to the bus.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he broke it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for the financial compensation, it also relies on the guilty party.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment of the Act, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movement of the stewards aboard the bus.
"Now, it has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, at the maximum speed on the highway and in the use of the laptop by the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes Spokesman Hanzelka, pointing out that the control of the safety of buses is under the power of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be constituted, according to the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB would provide a "competence block" that would be coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be a decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is still under intense pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for Financial Services Surveillance which, only recently, has made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, which knows Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas said in the presentation of the figures of the late-August semester that he saw no sense in the merger of the House of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the savings banks, has instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of the financial market.
The talks, however, have just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial position, comes into play because it is about consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it was believed that the Deta Bank could merge with the Bank of the Rhineland Palatinat and Halbab.
However, nothing has come out of this rotten bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse had ruled against any participation of Hellaba in them.
The other two houses also did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinat was connected instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Lander.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, spoke out against any trade strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could come first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers was to increase, potential partners would gradually escape.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis rather than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe group of savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geostrategic reflections, however, only reflect one facet.
Another question arises as to how the different business models of each of these banks can come together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, by which commercial model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be ensured, had not been resolved so far by the German group of savings and transfers banks.
In the end, a WestLb takeover could take place, a takeover that is obviously not wanted here.
This is also the case in the letter from the Board of Directors in place: in any event, a `global solution' would be included for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing like that, he says.
Behind them, close to a barrel of five liters of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds his dog can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kiss her.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nova station, four buses depart tonight at 11:45 p.m., 'destination Monaco, beer party', arrival scheduled at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already beside their flag, they've already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long coat that is folded with false fur and glasses with large silver mounts.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three spins only this year.
They go at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30.
Overnight would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and a leader of the German speaking group - Marco has taken a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses roll in the night on the Highway towards `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, the travelers sleep.
That is better, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates still take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty o'clock as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First: sew on the small yellow cap.
Desus is written on the left `Beer's Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the brewery open, Marco shouts in the early morning."
`Course!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise you block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, you have to divide them into the room!'
The cup, Marco cry, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the consignee!
Show security officers that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This evening, to be back here ten and a half hours ago!'
And that's where it went to the beer party.
On the way, someone new from yellow hats to trees to find the way, the panels and even an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who are going through the Alps and sinking into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrolean police officers, by Italian rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, who produce statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word `relatively' and that he saw that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This has indeed happened this weekend.
The capital of the Bavarian real estate company Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, received from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from turbulence in the markets.
One person in confidence told Reuters Monday that aid appropriations were issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and banks governed by public law.
In the background, Depfa's son-in-law bears the losses.
The state finance had, according to a newspaper article, refined itself in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since mistrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate had also slightly weakened from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period in the previous year, zeroed, profits from the allocation of fixed claims and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of the costs of downstream accounting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of gains of about 16 percent has proved to be moderated.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state finance had first misappelled on real estate industrial credits, which had then been affiliated to the Aarel bank.
Because conventional state funding was not cost-effective enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diverse.
On the value of the parent company, the Hypo Real Estate must make depreciations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group’s gains and losses, which is still fairly weak.
The fact is that dividends have been amplified.
By 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important investor in state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market as it has no customer deposit.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks has again significantly changed, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the appropriations from the Depfa of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement by the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for funding is covered by the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the running state.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured through funding until the end of 2009.
The chairman of HRE Georg Funke's steering committee, however, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to use medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institution (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Mortgage Real group in the market is now being ensured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have nothing but hoped for it.
However, in the light of the dynamic and the imponsibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable, however, that funding should not be used in all its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the gates of insolvency at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least temporary won't be able to reassure the spirits either.
The share price fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The course of obligations, on the other hand, is particularly good.
While the debt to the first head has barely moved, the course of second-tier loans is declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Bank Hypo Real Estate appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute even which led to the crisis entering the establishment through the acquisition of the bank Depfa.
As long as emission institutes, less-affected governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the setbacks will be over time.
Or what no one dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the likelihood of survival has now become a mere founded hope.
This should primarily reserve long-term creditors a night of insomnia on whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line to make a carry-over of losses over the next few years on the next tax on the return on capital from automatically collected stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is due for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to pamper with laughter: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already on my way to school was scaring me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as with us in Lower Saxony.
The students show up after each other from eight hours, until at nine hours minus twenty, a table tour starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all the kind to like talking to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue upskirts and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I stood before the desk, and tried everything to pronounce correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class all made bass masses, pouffed with laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese ados and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to those who were better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand the Japanese English.
During the break, they all went out their Bento.
My foster mother also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really something other than the wretched Germans in-house.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the confided salty plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to make a little better the knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always replied:
'Cause it's fascinating me, what?
In the end, reading mangas is what I have preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
Does a rat or a cockroach run away from the danger, does that mean he's also suffering from fear?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the "Edge" online magazine, contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have proof of it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains will have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of the feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter hard-to-do terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in front of a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave the same way, which is why some scientists deduct from it a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective life to that of difficult animals.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could be found in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not leave itself to be measured or, because of this particular hardware, analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the contents of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the importance of prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what happens to emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "pure" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) acquipares from the vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially humans.
A subtle degree of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerges, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to imputate them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be indemountable.
Pankseep argues that what is seen as fear in men and rats is likely to also feel that way in both cases: how could one verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach escapes from danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviours are not sufficient to prove identical experiences.
True, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the origin of sensations?
And even if we could prove this to man: how could we demonstrate it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are likely to be completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is moving nervously as we gauge the same thing in rats and men.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
This could be judged as short-term, but I prefer to move on rather than constantly form against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in cooperation with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there's still a lot to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadline.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met on the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We provided in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were convicted, already in the previous season, for manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League even had to be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adulterin Dennis Quaid.
It detracts - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and south of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis was for a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterous woman.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband's qualification fell clearly: it would be "Monstruux," he said at the New York Daily News, 54, that "Meg remixes the story of our relationship and manipulates it again".
It would be more "regrettable", than "the sentence and the upheavals that involve a divorce for each child are once again revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the twin father.
So was his answer to the tap: "In any case, my life continues.
I look forward to having a wonderful family that is doing its best."
Prices of air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Hotel flights and nights would have been beneficial again - this is the result of a study by the financial service provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mainly clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a "desiring travel desire of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be affected by lower prices for hotels than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in the area of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economic-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in the business-class and first-class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be slow economic growth, the firm explains.
The demand would be grounded in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the "Open Sky" Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were only 24 companies in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find an 11 functional.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player was only late in the game and his upshot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive manner.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffle Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the halls of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much going on in the lockers, the half-time was over, and most of them had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, he has a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and that it jumps with this second purpose!
The implementation failed.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "nowed to be more relaxed as well".
This 1:0 (1:0 in half time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit of the head by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121st anniversary on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its latecomers - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen hired from FC Bayern - is certainly slowly forming, but it doesn't shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the rescue plan's failure fell the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange index was 10.579 point with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that American Express date that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No securities could return profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accused a decrease of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the financial company's shares that can be exchanged in a manner consistent with the course's evolution in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
The lessons of action aspired in the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States are not at odds with investors' concerns.
The course of action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the bailout of the government's financial market.
Spectacular decreases in the courses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarian real estate finance has lost three-quarters of its value at the moment despite the federal government's bailout and private banks, the Commerzbank has claimed a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and cost 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the US government's heavy bailout plan of $700 billion could not be sufficient to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809,25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote should follow on October 1st.
The other European scholarships also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index accused a 3.2 percent decrease at the time, CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743.61 points after a 1.26 percent rise.

The multinational trade and tourism has further indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
From dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: from dark matter it influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulyses" has been flying in space.
As a result of cold fuel pipes, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been a cause of disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvring of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical tip, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
This has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpected faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him as the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes it's hard to believe that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what we call the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," he writes.
Researchers in space have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their fans, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed it.
The Sudanese fans had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija television channel and the Italian media reported in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages, when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had shot down six of the rapists in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be given by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the rapists wanted to free the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held up until the rapists found a safe road to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a father-in-law that leads to suicide."
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent facts.
The Truro High Court referred that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, between 5 and 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and ganged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he came back to live in the Cornwalls.
Her daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Miss Randle, an assiduous volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that friends had told that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronts the beautiful father of his daughter who had also written a letter of confession that ended as follows: "I attacked her and banded her regularly."
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done that gesture, her story would certainly never end in court."
He added: "I point out in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Conviction for the loss of official data.
The Cabinet ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the BBC's Office Secrets Act.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading to Waterloo.
Documents were handed over to the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the Departmental Officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work linked to the Assistant Committee on Secret Service.
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies face the B&B invoice.
British building companies may have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that harvest the money of the savers, including 59 companies of the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said that it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The loan of £14 billion will be repaid when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be owed, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each corporation must pay a sum in proportion to the deposits it owns, and that intermediate corporations must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will increase in 2009 to £450 million.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Corporations Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to her.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently during the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, dating back to the first years.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to assess the options to be taken to prevent building companies and their members from paying for this salt bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, the full year's interest, which could double, would have to be paid.
Since building companies are non-shareholders, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny to litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase following an increase of two penny in February, followed by a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide whether they go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been varied for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a motion for bail from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which is likely to be arrested upon his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him bail because of his filing for extortion to a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000) when he was a PM.
This case is one of the many charges that are brought to him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in a few weeks' time, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give it its full freedom first.
Some speakers stressed that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why he could not remain free upon his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will make an appeal against the Supreme Court order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denied the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
However, she stated that she was unable to reach out to children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman stated that this occurred despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses ITV's Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the ruling of the Competition Commission, which would force BSkyB to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence unfairly ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB, shares of ITV sow doubt about the effective independence of ITV, thereby inciting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing her to reduce her shares of ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on counsel's thesis that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The accused Special, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious, potentially unproven, criminal conduct charges have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the resignation of nine US prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed for poor benefits.
But then it came to light that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate charges of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial bodies for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first responsible" of these dismissals, and finally "abdicate" his role as leader," which was remarkably successful not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly makes it go away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was put into trade in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, falling to the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heart beat that has become irregular, after having collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, often forgotten, and Can Be Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents can't give directions to go to Extra Place, because they never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide to 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to restore Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, have said to be charmed by this short cut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house-paste.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that runs the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighborhood owners' committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives drafted a proposal allowing the building builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the committee #3.
"There are only a few spaces left belonging to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to restore the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the builder will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although society wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned driveway, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, noting further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has remained since abandoned.
The post-CBGB entrance, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones album" Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, hails, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution of East Village luxury, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (titled "Le Livre des Contestations: Un Regard Amérément Nostalgique sur Une Ville dans le Processus d'Extinction") relates to the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, dark, dark-day, nightly as well as bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers from the past week that fly along the gusts."
A few exceptions close by, the street always looks the same.
A short rat swinging at the bottom of the alley, near a door that was already leading to the CBGB, which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empty, stands side by side with newspapers that have just been thrown out.
A few passers-bys said they rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said he believed that some of the below considered the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have flown in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as You don't think about it. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a truthful fact.
To combat these differences, Mr.Obama's education program particularly supports among many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those learning English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends education in non-English language classes goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students in this school are largely Hispanic, and low incomes.
More than one third of students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 maths state exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient that Mr. Obama had developed.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr.Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months later, if you went without her class, you would have had no chance of identifying her."
"It works, she observes, "it has worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr.Obama's response.
Although it is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr.Obama has recently considered this question insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the wording of the English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Net Oil Falls Following New Concerns in the World of Economics
Oil prices have dropped sharply on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan for financial marches would be successful in restoring life to the economy.
The future operations of crude oil have fallen by 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel, the New York Stock Exchange, at this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After meeting in July, an increase of $145.29 per barrel, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the rescue agreement, the greatest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be sustainable.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, said the government this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have, in part, nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have said that this weekend's frenetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement," appear to have failed to revive the market."
While the economic situation is deteriorating, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contamination.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus will spread globally and in particular, in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Day of the Second Determining Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was watching the second time when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played heavily under dark clouds.
Then the back quarter Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a forerunner sign of a afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first one when a corner back fell and the second one, 10 seconds from mid-time.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his steps at Coles.
"he's a poor player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense beat the cardinals' back quarters, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball might well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
"The jet coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness," said "the second time or the third time?"
When the two jets were told they passed 21 unquestionable points in the third-time Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second-time more than the third.
"Many points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselasie rested, surpasses her world record.
Haile Gebrselasie, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, after beating his own record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 from a comfortable course on the plate, Gebrselassie beat her record of 2:04:26 for 27 seconds, last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselasie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from the 1600metres of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - it may be exaggerated in the eyes of today - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselasie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track riders like Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decrease of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselasie told the reporters, suffered cramps at the pier two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back there last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
He was especially accused in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia- having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually relying on hares as if they were in a race track, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of the capabilities of Gebrselasie as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselasie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. at my way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasie after the ranks disappeared.
At just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselasie made her final ride to get away from Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improving her best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, surprised everyone with the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing games because of a hypothetical backache, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It ran using a skillful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a good advantage , then exceeding about 18miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrives second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finishes third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Tests of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to integrate, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today."The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival held each year in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that it describes has become touristic thanks to its inclusion in Florida's tourism guide edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
It is also independent, worthy, and private that it was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, do not know what he loses".
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign look.
"We are very cautious about how to tell the story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has always been resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 people with twice the national average of poverty.
This is a central point, but also an example of South-South black rural culture - sometimes dejected, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown all over the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious such a big box in life as in literature, Hurston took readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds including Howard Miller always took care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also made mention of Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passersby.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associate Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, fuckor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a picture everyone liked.
Zora has well described the reality, "said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "some people didn't like it."
One always remembers Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston was usually in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were mocking her.
"people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair of the back yard that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some tomb, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration, nor plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy that she offered to the world "Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", said a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to take a five-way highway to the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main two-way street of the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west angle of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over race mixing led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a group of white youths came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
" a lady has even died. "
They launched a watermelon from their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened young people's confidence.
"Black children used to be kisses - I remember very well - our master was kissing in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Natiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as Chief Director of Community Safety at Eatonville, a group not profiting.
This lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Ms. Natiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a joyful clean trust and lines of conduct such as:"how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston regard her as a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, the count has rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Ms. Natiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole thing saying "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (of course named Hurston) opens in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, restored.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street during a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a low for the living red, are always afraid that their island community will not be understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
In particular, young people tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston as his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned Eatonville's description correctly.
"Most of the people who pass through this area will think, "oh, this city did not compare anything to others."Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluently finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass offices and bee nests above their teapot, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "office day of work" since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to slip on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffins trays for morning meetings.
The Latin still hangs among residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hung to a play arranged on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich at street merchants, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 a.m. in the week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I discovered to my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people doing the tail.
Not in front of the cashier's counters, either to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service's window, where the usual customers controlled their cheques, tourists asked for direction for Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all tailing for the same reason I did.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only work in one state, and that say they treat customers like their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank resorted to the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachova, to the $440 million savings account, desperately looked for a buyer to save her.
The office and store employees who are in front of me, frightened of another potential wreck, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, that is, the one that does the most rescue to Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that broke down, and her skinny CEO Dick Furd, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my economies in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Prosecrated Muslim tombs as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islam" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating striped mosques in red.
The police accuse extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the extreme right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is according to the police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the feelings of extremist hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be somehow related to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community stated that it was "profoundly shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches at its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that reported almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and the burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is forbidden from travelling abroad.
The courts have banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to travel to Spain through France to the authorities under control.
The police in Kent had granted this travel ban last Thursday after proving to the magistrates the guilt of Glitter for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's limited court, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court stated "Judieth 25 September at Ashford Court, the police in Kent requested an application to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be recorded in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police said it would not discuss particular cases or potential displacements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent police will do everything they can to protect our children like those abroad.
"According to us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, having served 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore obliged to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court of limited jurisdiction in Uxbridge, West London, for the registration of the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no sneeze clothes.
The essence of the masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and the stolen glances of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes over the specific iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage of passion, sadness, joy...by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What interests me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of flamenco stars."
With the festival "Chant Popular des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the flamenco perception according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic was the constant of this work presented to the El Fotómata gallery these days.
The flamenco celebrities such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty artists photographed.
The project was transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits de old sportifs" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, know them and be able to enter their lives for a longer or longer moment.
I believe that portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You're in front of people, people that sometimes you don't know or just leave you for a few minutes so you can take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at Galerie El Fotómata, located on the 20th Street of the Mata (a street parallel to the Peupleraia d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "real bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is well determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and who passed through the Amazonia.
The favourite at the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday confessed to the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a true boldness" and that "everything shows that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to, and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw some 100 writers, historians and journalists parade in the city of the aqueduct and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most awaited character of the third edition of this festival and has completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants' votes, made a great show at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The Festival's presenter, Félix Romeo, was confronted with a fascinated audience who did not see the time spent during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great deal of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical manner" through intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no means" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because the writers were asked "not to let go of frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco fair
The party of the banners that concluded the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse bulls verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hung on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
On display, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making movements of arms in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
In the afternoon Alejandro Talvante himself concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered steps applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a clearly better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours less ten in the morning.
Control of the movement of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two take the leak.
Its loading, more than two tons of hachisch, of what to stop them from.
Police officers prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information provided by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1 at the border of the Arminón Municipality.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police started their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further down the coast, where the two occupants went down to escape into a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilos of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons, and then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with the one written on the gray card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and determine the source of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. detainee was held in police custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the following hours.
The actress Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the influence of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol unveiled in People's magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear was "deeply leaning on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she was rolling on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping in the middle of the highway and leaving his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents led her to the drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was removed from the scene, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of having been driven by a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated at around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous depression.
Llamazares requested the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after having been accused of performing treatments for his family members.
"In these cases, I am a very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the conduct of the political party that he will have to adopt in the City Council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "extreme ethical codes for all public servants".
"Mayo's Blood," Garci's bear bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasts more than two and a half hours," Sangre de Mayo" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci ensures that with this filming "a dream of child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "one-stop chance" to reproduce with the appropriate decors and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has deceived itself as leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films" Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "May Blood"-, because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The film director of "Back to Start" has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before starting the shooting and to whom he does not make casting, since this seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the film director is to go to the theatre and cinema to keep him informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times as candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidates who represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven Tables de Billard français" and finally the winner, "Les tournesols blinds", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Serbian dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillean dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillean dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two-wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to interpret the Sevillen dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers," she says.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of these kinds of artists who were considered to be divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and values her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married Poet" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, was part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón come to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Light Knight" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having travelled in the various Andalusian provinces, goes to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
I like America less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was a part of it."
This sentence is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice," and is a good example of the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been around since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a tough shot for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and now I've lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
Nobody was afraid of getting ridiculous or overreacting.
One of the fathers of film and country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the American esteem has fallen far short, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When the times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only the admiration of humans left and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for drug fighting created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had difficulty imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed us the bar high," observed George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to pierce the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to even if the opportunities did not fail him not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Through all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthrop," he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all errors during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the very beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of the backsards, which obliges you to go ahead.
This is not bad, but if they make you move, it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the back (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long waiting row) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second error, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy that small shirts with less tissue and less expensive?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long wait, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebellions and assaults of the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, has not properly marked the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind in particular.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies Conference presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on to the company's campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listening and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also bring them together according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she says she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless apps, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continuously added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to be understood.
He's in the same position as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth but as relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer is turned on only to spin Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than walking windows.
Who serve half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the least?
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less busy, less complex months.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster displays their request to use their own search tool - "Ta recherche. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso leaned on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' by Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the outfit of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we begin to list all of its appearances, we could also quote this mustachu ribud that raised weights in a travelling circus.
It's not just a simple men's body jersey in cotton, wet and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel ' distinguishes himself from others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive logo and by the little Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) that the most known body jerseys have in their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of the underclothes.
Even if it's too bad to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the sisters Cruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but as well as at the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and myself created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards ' and the Opera Dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
Cinema from the '50s and '60s enchants us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I like to wander around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but eventually everything joins and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's to look in my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
The dancers like to dress up very well for classes and tests, to look into the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when you put on your clothes, that's when you actually put yourself in the person's skin.
Then everything's tied up.
You didn't get 30 years ago: was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years rejoice.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and savors life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna become a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and I also want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I will do is to give my son a lot of happiness and to raise him with a lot of love.
Come to the movies, you expect the different movies you shot last year to come out.
It's true, I can't wait for them to come out.
I who is a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the Tomb of Christ' coming out.
See what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for a very long time, to invite me to participate in London in a charity show for her association in support of women and the clothes we display - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a soft heart person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make it stink, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol repeaters in the wheel will have to install the 'alcock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting the drunk vehicle, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project for a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in drunkenness are taking back the car.
Alcoholock would avoid this because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol rate in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than that authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device had reduced up to 65 per cent of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people each year.
This measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but reform by criminal means requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 1740 hours, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias landed in the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF was scheduled to arrive.
The sun was on the eve of bed, but its rays still required the hand of the visor in order to see the royal couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Oh, well, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when to her, has windy hair, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm threatened.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before passing into the room where the official courtroom awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a Rigolo journalist on Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
Surely there is no place more appropriate in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and surely there is no designer living more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango showcase at the 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and she almost cried for emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest shop of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, have made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family, Mango's presidential table, it looked even more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and making a bad fortune good heart, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH trimmings, which cut the breath, and arm on it, arm below with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the night without a veston because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pants and shirt – from her own collection – and who for the dinner, got involved in wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the opera night tour, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and recalling the good old time, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'large fold'.
Ines Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us before on her cell phone pictures of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves by motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked in advance, there were no smells in his room.
Starry stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, number of stress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown the whole, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning wakes up almost attracts us when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think of the restless pace that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and labour-related problems.
But 1001, not one more, not one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to each one's taste and time.
The work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manuel' dementes such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural 100% recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run into your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talk when sleeping
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it can surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration in sleep that is called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
It's certain there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day according to the child does not remember anything anymore.
There are no single causes that determine its appearance
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresies (piping in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or overexcitation.
However, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, weepings, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation of this problem.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration in sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid more or less violent TV shows or shows.
With very nervous children and having difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm themselves internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeping nets appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if it is very distressed several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because by sleeping, he's not conscious so he can organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming of, from the moment you pay attention to the way you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes much anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of dissecting.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who was slipping the lucarne on a far-off shot, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and tower at Fonderflick tower from afar, then with Hirn on top, Romain at the foot of the foot or Diebold came to stifle Dannemarie's defense.
In the face, we were blocking in the middle of the field and just leaving Riahi at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take a repulsed bullet on a first attempt of Diebold (53e').
But the Butter Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the lockers a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illuuseian Eleven who just went a little back to "compact" his defense, apart from the last few seconds of play where, after a big mess, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy meeting angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who have greatly disturbed the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère to meet with their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the flow of diesel prices, which has reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president will "discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they carried out strangled operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures close to 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A filter dam has been launched on Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic and the Channel façade, as well as the Olonne Sands, in Vendée, where the trawlers have remained on the dock, or at the Havre, where about twenty ships have blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total Refinery of Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer people decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday to give the movement and its participation in the interview provided for in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who have not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not wish to move to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they consider that the cost-effectiveness threshold of a ship is reached only with a diesel less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the legend of the film and the actor hired Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aviator sits on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession on the world economy.
The fourth global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the air carrier delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have refocused, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, says the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision was made on these assignments, and the TF continues.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders to a due degree.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, representatives denied the Secretary to the Henry Paulson Treasury the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was on this level," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will not come "too late".
"If the project is indeed dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the conditions of credit," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
More accentuated by the sense of urgency, "each day that passes brings down a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the buyback of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, driving emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Ten-year bond yields declined to 3.632 per cent, compared to 3.827 per cent on Friday evening, and 30-year yields to 4.161 per cent, compared to 4.357 per cent on the day before.
Obama, winner of the first TV duel
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another followed to know who took it from John McCain or Barack Obama.
Without any surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been "bright enough" to allow him to halt his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose published opinion poll on Saturday granted a five-point advance to Obama (49% versus 44% to McCain), found that the Democrat drew his pin from the game.
In the indecisive voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them give McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his Thursday advance with the well-awaited performance of his colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain continued to highlight his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naiveness" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
An attack angle hammered since yesterday in Republican TV ads.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without dismounting, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain hasn't yet understood, while Obama, if he did," retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"Through the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people assembled for an election meeting in North Carolina in a beating rain.
He did not even utter the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial diversion clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the cliff.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's overcrowding, he also pointed out that the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates have avoided questions about the $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young and opposing women demonstrated Sunday evening in the main place of Belarus to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening from the closure of the polling stations in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What good, since they will do what they want of my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made it a good figure for foreign observers in order to return to their language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the depopulation," lamented Jouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is that there is the vote, and in us it is the executive power.
If Members of the opposition enter the parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that participation figures were too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you? question the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five MPs from the opposition to the parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night returns to the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of her foundation yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Héma-Québec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the public gulf, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by J. Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to file his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec started his activities, barely 38% of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile."
Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle from its inception on 28 September 1998.
At that time, many cases of the human form of crazy cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, had been erupted in Europe, telling the one who held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports was that when one does not know and that a serious disease can result from it, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures were introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied has meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that directly detect in donor blood the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then rested.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, says the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This significantly reduced the risk of certain donors being infected without knowledge and not being able to detect them.
These improvements have significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Québec's head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continued before stressing that, in addition to a security supply, Hema-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
"Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average only accounts for 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person, aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria, may, however, give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria persists, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so scary, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of its blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was already considered a biomedical waste grunts with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and are expected to take more than a thousand per year.
It should start to be proposed for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they have no access to it," as Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Half-final Impact
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division's elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total of the goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the fourth round of the finals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfield Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half goalless on both sides, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other strands of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round of the series, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, suburban Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the game back to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still won the half-final 5-4 round in total.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victory Purpose of Kovalev
The Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He's had a good ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year
Soon after the Liberal Party's general council ended, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Removing the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of image-shaped Moulin.
They were spinning in loops, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means, as in electoral periods.
At the press point, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, simply explained why the North was "a jewel in immense potential," but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydro, forest, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territorial twice as big as France", "it's our home, it's Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is ours," he insisted, as well as to show that he called for a national founder myth.
Quebec built a lot in its relationship with the North, he emphasized: the gold rush in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It's our future," he added, having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government," he said.
In other words, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open all year long due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pégist MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place began work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
Northern development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
"As the Liberals who preceded us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to repopulate Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party succeeded in forging the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press point, he invoked another conservative reference, John Diefenbaker's Roads to the North program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest pointed out that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I intend to be there," he told his militants, arousing nourished applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He points out, however, that his schedule is completed, notably by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and that the latter will have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The Beijing leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy of North Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutiny that is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADAQ said it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "honour" for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves our full admiration says as long about the Prime Minister's entourage as Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its resident locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denied its word and allowed a child-soldier to break into inhuman conditions.
The only one who turns to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, plead for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still don't realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper keeps waving and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here is the time when no morals exist anymore: one can mislead, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the desire of a head of government up to this minority (so it will be after October 14...).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the Orwellian logic states that the largest gold company in the world has attempted a defamation prosecution of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Without any surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to the ruin of anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will haunt the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to consider the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in the public opinion that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas and not through the coup d'étrage.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining industry to open its books, records and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have made light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate while scorning the opinions of the same audience?
In the vice president's world, it seems that this word refers only to paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even the detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada is doing it first and foremost because it rejects the brutal way in which it is mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a bail-out (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal complaint with Black Canada authors, intimidating them to cease the use of this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's prosecution is a direct attack on university research freedom and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to citation of credible sources and debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, who can do so, without repeated prosecution?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic environment, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the academic world, as it is to the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place mechanisms that limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollars plan to halt the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elected of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to the leaders of the companies rescued.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"That's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had turned sprint in recent hours because of fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on investor mood.
The deadline was to open the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the U.S. presidential election, later associated with the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their discontent with the fact that they were forced to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed himself to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the provision to allow owners to keep their homes and the provision on the salaries of government-recovered business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no welcome.
But these measures are needed," he commented on the American television waves.
Asked on another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines that I have read [present] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsoldable debts of US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulting in liquidity freezes and bank and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elites who had the first draft of agreement capped last week.
This impasse has been believed to have been removed since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only provided by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round things up for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government were to take up losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its implementation.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to be added to another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for its assistance, Washington will obtain participation in the aided companies that will be worth dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to resell when the torment is passed.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans involved in this plan, as well as to set limits on the pay and severance allowances paid to the leaders of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives as of today, and of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
In fact, voices continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democrat camp.
"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to take advantage of the taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but came to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to tell us: we are asking Congress not to hurry and examine carefully the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had renounced its full-fledged competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) in the crisis of risk-based real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, voting rights are collected in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that time is uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
Yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander announced that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaging icon
Its beauty in the eyes of the blue was long its strong map, of some will say its weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its potency, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source will also have it removed from the power register that feeds the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83, from a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fabled years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he looked like and whose long he was a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also ascribes to the freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of a Jewish German father and of a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last brand of quality.
For in it there was a whole country of self-made man, of the combatants of the Pacific War, wounded in the fight, which in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the driver who ranked second at 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic star-like star also disappear with him, and we will not have completely pierced the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, while his big roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-century of a seventh American art in perpetual motion parade through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr Bridge is mentioned, troubled at his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This nice malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take his character back on the return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
It's him again.
Ages are rushing through its path.
Young people know him mainly through George Roy Hill's celebrated Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several legends of the cinema who left the profession early, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his fascinations and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a challenge living in "underplaying" judging his benefits too much.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first youth than the marginal ones: neuroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown facets of his true pudical sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), along with her wife Joanne Woodward in her main role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes yesterday to Newman, his great friend and former arms mate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood drifts is also working.
We have seen a lot of his fine throne on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of bad taste, though initially gag.
However, the profits from these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will be engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and above.
What could make Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoice factory well?
Next, on 8 October, hearings will begin on ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuchlag and his accomplices.
Politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has resulted in particularly significant damage, and other charges have been held against them, such as for example, forgery and the use of forgery.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipal money, about 65 million HUFs in total, went on one hand to the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, to the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to raise the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, after which no real benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoices from the Józsefváros market, while producing the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to be included in the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the rounds in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuchlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which model they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András
During a "finder circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuchlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice issued on behalf of the Jobb Jövőert Foundation, which will later be named Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert, was grieving with errors of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The invoice issuers to the overflowing imagination also fell into the excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name Jobb Jövőert nor the name of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told the site hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that these were false documents.
"Our company's name and tax number were placed at a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there, also did not collide, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of the zele invoices also did not give information about the travel agencies of Budapest, which were part of their choice, but which organized only trips abroad. Thus, naively, they reported stays in Hungary on bills to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services relating to travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőert was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Moreover, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that "transmitters" have also made errors by referring to the carriage of goods by road as a supply, that the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for forms vices, such as types of inadequate invoices and false cachets, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved to be false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó's sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The Faussaries also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time that (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company denied issuing this invoice.
Bills deliberately drawn up
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestert Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has made an invoice in the order of the foundation Együtt in Harmadik Évesredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuchlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices in the order of the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlas Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefit was actually provided.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were later cancelled, but this was avoided by the organizations from mentioning them in their accounts.
The next category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the director general of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. in Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he invoiced Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, and that he took their countervalue.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He was still using these companies, since, at the request of Maître Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the acts of foundation of the companies, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuchlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth 14.2 million HUF.
The Public Prosecutor's Office thought that 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices and VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetseg Association of Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of manufacturing invoices, as they had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuchlag himself, decided to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of much of the 50 million HUF, Zusa would bear only the hat.
Today, the latter is probably vex, since the applications for his placement in a supervised residence, based on a relief from his conditions of detention, fall continuously into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of superpower: Why do we spend more money?
During auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the merchandise.
Neurology and economic researchers at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be detached in this type of competition, such as an auction sale on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using sales to experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the loto, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (FRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, which is an essential element of a third, the whole being under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving in an intensive way when the part was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overemphasized in the face of a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group about the actual value of the product in question, and so did they.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they won the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auctions, members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed at one on victory, while at the other on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the players' team members "against failure" were willing to put higher stakes than those made by the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them only explained the phenomena found during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred miles of patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles after treatment, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through the blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended that they get vaccinated against A and B viruses. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach ailments and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, every year a million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to reach the virus, because the pathogen sneezes the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected on time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contamination disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experience by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshock, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, to which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment is carried out in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and spreading electroshock is fixed to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a sustained manner, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with hermine painted by Léonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, dealt with its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either religious-themed painting or the one with a more general theme.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", like someone whose "care" they "kept" and who "resolved themselves, and peace invaded them".
In view of religious theme painting, they reported 12% pain less than when they looked at Léonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself has taken part in the experience, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided that one finds the right photo.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one showed believers a Madone painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you're saying about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of the people's pocket in the same way as the sky above their head. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interest centers are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While the sceptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision do not see just the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated at the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their original goal, which was as follows: "Let's collect in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's head interviewed, after ten years of world chamboling work, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives of being able to process all the information.
Did Schmidt reply that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the best job for me?"? However, software will not be able to answer that kind of question, simple at first sight, that the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all netizens that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Customized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and we will submit products and services based on our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is?They ask users, who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly revolt against power that can arouse counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights netizens were able to push a sigh of relief last May, when Google, standing on the bottom with the EFF legal protection agency, proved its right to court in the face of the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google still cannot be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But ultimately, it is not able to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is misled by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American Geek culture and its "sauvageons" bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected incorporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though they both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, in the face of the official giant of the software.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word of recent years, rightly draws behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels made available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even connect them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which automatically appear their most recent photo galleries they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While many examples can be seen, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands the views of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society who fired one of her employees, only for the sincere opinions that she wrote on her blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the privacy term is totally to reconsider today.
The one who lives an online life, consists of what he shows of himself, and that is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not small. Google's services online, through the processing of text to the processing of images, to read information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which have existed so far.
Public opinion expects, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its present value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising fields threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasing speed lead to serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
However, the critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the society has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the company's motherhood and after the society has found it too expensive to restore the multiple daily restoration, taken any time. All this seems derisory alongside the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book scan and archiving project takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be frightfully approached only through Google's data.
Two minors helped eliminate the traces of the double murder of Ózd
"The police called on two minors to question them in the case of the double murder of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
Young people have recognized the facts they are accused of, and yet they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to the information of MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder may result in detention of up to five years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old boy, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt and that's why he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as this 9-year-old little girl.
According to MTI reports, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden in the crime scene is proof of that.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Exchange makes a proposal for the buyback of the Prague Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange stock package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the earlier exclusion of the Czechs from the Warsaw stock exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague stock exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer made so far for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York stock exchange, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that it could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent participations, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, European press leaders are already referring to a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the American President" - the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party a bill, improvised to the va-vite, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as mentioned by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it is the shortcomings of the political leadership there that led the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world will pay the price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress vote, a real danger, the one that Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - notes the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states may still have a bailout to their titubant financial agencies, and through the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse such dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to take little account of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
Only Monday, the weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - he recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in their pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, partly crosses the old continent.
The "sauveurs" should not be branding a hundred billion euros at a time, but it would be wise if they noticed in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Smart automobile mimics bourdon flight
What better method would be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the burgeoning bees gave the strategic idea of departure to the engineers at Nissan to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired auto-robotized, BR23C-type control system, which he has equipped bee qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval-shaped, which actually looks a lot like our safe protection helmet - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The bee's facetted eye plays an important role, since it is able to see in all directions, in a 300 degree angle.
In order to imitate the functions of the facetted eye, the engineers approached the idea of laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into a avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Contrary to any existing system at present, this avoidance exercise is carried out entirely instinctively.
"If this was not the case, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blinking eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot could be used.
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is greater, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should deal with only a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and to react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
You don't need memory of a giga-bytes capacity, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology used for instant avoidance. Nissan's estimates suggest that this system will make its entry into cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion Savings Plan, which aims to buy the suspicious credits of the banks, and to use them several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this is going to be spent.
Reuters announced that during further debates until after midnight, on Saturday, local time on the east coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the disputes that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said that there is nothing left to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still have to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular ascent in the scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill for the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the advances made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the Spokesperson of the White House.
In addition, the programme diverge from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent at one time for the purchase of dubious securities.
From now on, up to half of the 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passed the law, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy suspicious bank receivables, while the use of the $100 billion additional will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent organization, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the terms of the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase doubtful claims, mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent individuals stated that redemptions may take place as part of a auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which companies have paid an equivalent premium for foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large buyback of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid may expect their starting allowances, which are simply called a golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
The salary cap is only mentioned in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its support to the company.
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys from a auction, they will collect a tax surplus on the golden parachute, unless the President of the discredited bank retires.
Directly after the purchase of doubtful debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leadership is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The capping only concerns new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in effect on the endorsements of directors generals - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State provides a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. Thus, the risk of taxpayers decreases, as they can even be won in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall back on their legs.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said California's Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that they were the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to the August 2007 month - the Central Statistical Office of Hungary reports.
Industrial export sales prices increased 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, compared to those of a year earlier, decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of domestic and export price fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices only increased to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry were only slightly up 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the product and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
A deflation resulted in oil processing (1.4 per cent), machinery and electrical equipment (0.9%), as well as a minimal increase in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Paper production, publishing and printing prices have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors, which are a significant weight in domestic industrial exploitation, prices have risen by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing prices were the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacture of metallurgical products, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the price increase has evolved from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In the whole processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and sectoral allocations, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7%) was initiating investment profit sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material sectors for further processing did not experience any change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared with the same month of the previous year, the largest increase in energy and material production was observed for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, inflation of 6.8 per cent was measured, while in the profit-initiating sectors, inflation of 1.4 per cent was measured.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they decreased by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment declined by 1.7% compared to the euro, and 7.1% compared to the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that around 12 January, the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs told Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now, everything depends only on the moment the electronic input and control systems are put into service."
On occasion, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisors of candidates for the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, provided their support for the $700 billion government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, the representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday morning, that they had reached agreement in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the goal of the deceleration of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even more capable of driving the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the highlight of economic issues, Obama again succeeded in getting a little ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a cholistier just after the Republican convention, melted.
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would vote quickly on the 700-billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"Now it is necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
There was no lack of qualification of McCain's economic ideas as outmoded.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, "We'll all have a hard time swallowing it... but nothing can be done."
The Republican Senator stated that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Control Committee and the capping of senior management's severance allowances are mentioned, and that he was personally very attached to these issues.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - that is what the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, refers to.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, CSU erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and thus also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to be completed just ten years ago was over: the undisputed hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU gathered with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of Stoiber's so-called elections.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
This has been reported by sociologists for 40 years, but they have been very mistaken about rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only inside the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that, in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have gone rather far from the CSU, such as the independents, craftsmen, the owners of the bac and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support has decreased below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom ? The party presidents are on the reserve in the face of the coalition's questions", the Conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ would like to discuss it with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids SPÖ to get involved in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss it with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any event, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of opposition or of entry into the coalition is momentarily a very open question, and these points must be debated in the ÖVP.
Mr Haider, the President of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fides European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and thus, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Congressman Fidesz Popular Party's press office, Járóka warned that, alongside the distinctions found in the hiring process, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma people do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of elementary education of poor quality, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in promoting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union's member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in as wide a circle as possible, also between Roma and non-roms.
In fact, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to a quality education, and must be protected from a low quality and sectarian education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's collaboration on an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools, with respect for existing anti-discrimination directives in preparation being of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and joblessness. It is necessary to give the possibilities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe," said Járóka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equality of Chances for All, the objective of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe, organised every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, targeted at European level and at the level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
In October, the decision on the fate of the duo defunct Huber-Beckstein will be taken.
Despite this pitiable electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their seats. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent voice loss, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
In any event, the members of this highly criticized pair felt that they did not have a special seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to calm the angry members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the "Babarois tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU has been Bavaria's "only sovereign" giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong presence in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, has also received a place in this modest reconnaissance group, which initiates tactful discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the values of the right, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange footing of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose taking action against Stroiber served as the possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then treated the very ambitious municipal political woman without moving.
Now, CSU leaders put all their energy into stabilizing, in some way, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far drew the strings in the backstage, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on September 28 as the most loving day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be a chance only if they set up one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment from the fiasco, the CSU's loss of ground will not negatively influence the great coalition in Berlin.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis still lasts.
Since 1946, SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed in the course of voting.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation made up of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very well opposed for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, renewing his term of office as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, would "allow" this time the presence of a few MPs of the opposition to the parliament on the tracks of the Constitution's amendment in 2006.
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as an anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which was increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines across the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior soothing.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday had already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when voting.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for already a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch in our newspaper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, although "the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms with voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put sticks in our wheels for dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of officially-supported retirees does not really regard it as appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," said Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said to the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." Thus, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never before, in the history of the Chigi Palace, there were no rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But as of today, this new measure against the little horns is in force, against which it points and then goes to drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fake novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Rolling doors" says Brunetta, "are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the Minister.
Now a new season of accountability and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" also highlights Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees was recorded, the Secretary General assured: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister says that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand workers in over a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration .
Italy, "including wage dynamics," explains the Minister - in the last 8-10 years they doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of decree Brunetta using Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service today provides data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- writes the association of consumers- the people of the "active workers" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Administration have gathered to declare war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional benefits in the case of infirmity due to service is challenged; the extension of the hours of the hours of residence of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crime prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, causing almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of the institutions, the social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of workplace prevention," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his" sincere appreciation for the ongoing partnership effort to promote workplace prevention, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion"
"naturally undignified, everyone has punched to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of the part of young people entering the labour market.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed how much" this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all the institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
Accidental labour figures seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later.
"we do not wish that this "reduction trend" actually translates into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that, in general, we are not doing enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We believe that Mercandelli- more checks and inspections are necessary, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
He added: "There is still a need to make an effort with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of employers' responsibilities in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "resource of assistance to which the system has been oriented in recent years."
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the destiny of the one who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player pointed to the finger, they risk hearing.
Listening to full volume music over an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report- lisons us in the note- it shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of auditory capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable manner," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data, the EU responsible is pursuing a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What is most important is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the EU executive- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against noise exposure from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but the concern increases as to the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure duration.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, which listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force for the maximum level of noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.E.
Rome, Germano gave the order to start the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it wishes to emphasize Germano - it will have to propose ideas for development of Rome which can be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No overlap of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a major project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June- announcing the Mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Germano replied: "It depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France through the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further forward, towards a deeper prospective working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "it takes a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, in order to enable our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, the Mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on his part, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really cute: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that counts in total, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; of course they are attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the southern U.S., wrote an article: once in the polling station, we know to whom the American patriot will vote.
That's what emerges from an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say whatever you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Choices never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home with a kick at the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the weakness of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge stain to perform.
U.S. economic downturn is felt even by journalists: in the press, it's time for deletions, and many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists have been asked by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work in the assembly of newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, is to be reduced in a significant way.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no harm in seeing where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses are divided into a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murder" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to relying on technology hoping that it "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the greatest accroc in American journalism lies among those who run newsrooms - that is, directors- and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "security of work".
Directors who think they lose their jobs in the space of 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are going to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (nos editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10mile a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "malades" during the year.
That's because of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTAINS THE GROTTAFERATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is surveyed for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl Climbing instruction.
During his trial last week, he had obtained the release of his home transformed into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the city of province to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the pm did not grant) would allow it to influence its society and have access to the evidence that accuses it.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and is still, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its long-standing, moderate East Coast soul, favourable to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washingtons" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, quite rightly, which has made itself felt despotically with the vote that I was speaking to you at the beginning.
What has just been cited, however, is only one example of the changes, of the major changes that the economic earthquake in progress is pre-announced or already leaves to run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomenon that has been under way for some time, to the extent that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the revival, the extraordinary revival, of the double-class sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balances of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or, it has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common policy lines.
And so, it is the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a affection for credits: when we go through a difficult period, there are only those states that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized once and for all that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with things that are relatively unmaterial such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but that are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more maps than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the bad luck to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other side, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow.
And in addition, something still deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have at the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
in short, the demand for leadership, subterranean food, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" improvised elections or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter most recently, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, at the fall of the Labourers in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it could well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accreditations, their format, would say someone, have always more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and thus represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts potentially in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keeping big eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring only 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The U.S. Journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explain Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that provide the animal with a perfect adhesion.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "is easily detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering faculty of the University of Dayton.
MARCHER SUR LES MURS? –" this material could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are the drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE AUTER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also working to find a new membership.
In an article by the American journal American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive consisting of microfibres such as hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are discouraging and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, affect the absorption amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in boxes or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti- staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS A RISQUE- It is the Italian Agency of the drug itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warns doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to pay attention to what is being drunk, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Longue is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Université Publique de Milan, called: "These discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is still necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that you take, and, if something is not clear, do not get impressed, but make a clear contact with the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert at Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A forecast that unleashed many polemics, and that was blamed to the economist for years, but that has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even shocked at the rapidity with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great economist", but also a very aggressive communicator of style, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org.3.0 broadcast, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the less austere revised interface, to more important ones, such as compatibility created for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and in addition to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition to the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the free theme can be a way to spread it to the homes, it is precisely in business that Open Office will try the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not counting the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on the databases; and Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today we count almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the predicted figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, third-qualified, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the site of the daily L'Equipe that brings the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl's samples have been carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If counter-analysis confirms positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus brimming the peas jersey with the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS IF ITALY IS RACISED?
Italy "as an emigrant country has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" received with reluctance.
This would transform the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is all about, which has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where one registers "more integration and more work", but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the most important support for the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislature required by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend underlined by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market does not know about crisis
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families from which they come must support - explains the head of the study office in Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand on the part of the students has so distorted the market that a generalized growth process has begun for the residents themselves.
In most cases, rental offers also contain a series of violations: free, unregistered, rent-free contracts, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from 650 euros minimum (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the nearby areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Values slightly lower (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you go away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city's economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-Community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old Paradise cinema, the cities elicit the historic halls.
Historical cinemas ferment in favor of the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalizing cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multi-halls, and the death of consumption of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that we find inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historic places full of memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of path and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Heaven Cinema, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia in a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the halls of the main cities that have paid for it mainly: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 cinemas single rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is well the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-salle cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should nevertheless guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit for traders: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, EUR 16 million to EUR 18 million per year would be required.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of these in Italy, to defend and promote the single cinemas rooms of the historic centres and on the outskirts.
Among the regulations, there are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and some parking.
"It's an initiative that I like" notes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
It is clear, however, that, in order to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise cinema" that I had thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side so as not to see the black signs by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Town Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges were brought by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of the Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external contest for mafia association.
The cuffs also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little lawyer son, the homonym of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a confrontation with legal and moral norms, and above all good sense" the prosecutors wrote, the two local governments had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - writing the judges - to formally enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee, not only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in its region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the drangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed those of July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
From the end of April last, Gioia Tauro's council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of the alleged constraints between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a coalition of center right after the May 2006 ballet.
He yelled at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, who accused him of handling the whole for a political question, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in demanding the change in the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is released "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a better known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born waves, now the bigs start .
This is a massive deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossals like Chevron have put their eyes on, and now they're trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now ecologists and the new oil increase give a great boost to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity need could be covered by offshore houla operating systems.
That amount would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colossae on the attack.
The first marine energy company was Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a facility in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a real revolutionary step would have been said.
Two years from that, more and more candidates among these companies who have always been dedicated to traditional energy rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said a company spokeswoman associated with the American oil colossal, the economic daily Wall Street Journal, and assessed opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit deliberated by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. New York and New Jersey Ocean Power, which travel the path of energy from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its early stages, on the other hand, the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the mud upwards and downwards, is converted into hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking using six marine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water at tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorities to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A special interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves the potential of tides at this time.
Although this is intermittent, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and expects investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
