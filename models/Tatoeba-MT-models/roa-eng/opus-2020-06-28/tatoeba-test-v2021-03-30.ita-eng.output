I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life proceeded smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They talk very fast.

Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to her about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm old enough.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historic movie?

Everybody go.
Giant panda live only in China.

Swallow the bhakri while the pot is heated.

Stop snooping.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt the pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
Do you want to eat with us?
Doesn't seem too surprised.

I'm very disappointed.

I wish you'd called me.

Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I captured him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to become more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
It broke the smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What are you going to do this summer?
I got irritated.
Can you speak shanghainese?
It's down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.

Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village had died after sundown.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why are you leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.

Here's his picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You must listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all of his drinks.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem of your idea.
You sound like you're the boss.
Do you want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does he look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
They're gonna die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When does your new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?

I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue." "Who'll offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I walk all the time.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be an Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken.
He was supposed to do it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.

We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever.

Tom and I are pretty busy.
She hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.

It was published in 1969.

Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, don't you know what I mean?
Keep out of the way.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to get this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.

It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything that has been learned. It is disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is disease to be also obsessed with defense. It is disease to be also obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Fixing the mind obsessively on anything is considered disease.

Let me be his alibi.
He was walking slowly along the road.
It only takes 15 minutes, doesn't it?
They know who you are.

I went home.
I found him lying on the bed.
I bought some flowers.
We just make uiguro food.
Be careful with them.
She doesn't respect him.
I just told her the truth.
I'm not a teacher anymore.
Tom told us a sad story.

I was in the bathroom.
I'll start working soon.

I'll be here tonight.

Don't hurt anyone.
I'll introduce my father.
I'll give them the message.
The future has many names.

The first step is the most difficult.
Tom, where did he learn French?
Did you give it to him?
Let's do it.
Please, sign my address.
I can't see her.
They feel hungry.
You don't say anything.
I read Tom's diary.
They came to the place that was revealed by God, and he set up an altar in the ancient way, and the wood was arranged just as he wanted it to happen to burn his son after he had killed him.
Bring us something to eat.
You have to go.

You can't be afraid to fail.
Were you really scared?
Relax, it's safe now.

You don't love.
Don't disappoint her.

Didn't you know I had a new car?
What helped you speak French so well?

Do you even have a vegetarian pizza?

Without a doubt, every generation feels as if it were destined to rebuild the world. However, my knowledge that it will not rebuild it. But its role is probably greater; it implies preventing the world from self-destruct.
I can't get in.
Can we come with you?
Did I eat it?
It's not true that you watched TV.
That book's not yours, it's mine.
Why is Tom covered in mud?
I never met Mary.
"Where's my cake?" "Sorry, I ate it all."
Ask me if you don't understand.

I know he's busy.
This is a story written in French.
Who's the president in your country?
Tom doesn't hear anything?
What is a great way to stay open, socialize, but also be safe in these pandemic times? For many people the obvious answer concerns water.
Can we come with you?
Do you have a room?

And hang in there.
The pizza there was expensive.
Give me a sponge.

All the seats had already been taken.
My dad's out in the garden right now.
Pick up the dog.

My older sister won't leave me alone.
Tom cut off my thoughts.
Tom knows more than you think.
Let's all see the same sun.
I wasn't in love with anyone.
This drink tastes like cat!
Get the towel out of the bag.
"I was the first." "Really?"

My cat is really nice.
Whose baseball glove is it?
You're not as brave as you look.
