Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?

I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life proceeded smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They talk very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with smoothies.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
That's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to her about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm old enough.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historic movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant panda live only in China.
I'm on my way.
Don't say such things.
Worse than that!
Jim is Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still missing.
I ate all the apple.
Swallow the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uyghur food.
We're leaving for Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop snooping.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt the pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
Do you want to eat with us?
Doesn't seem too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's broke, isn't he?
Is this cage intended to protect against sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I was playing the trombone when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I captured him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to become more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
It broke the smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What are you going to do this summer?
I got irritated.
Can you speak shanghainese?
It's down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom asked himself what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village had died after sundown.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why are you leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's his picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You must listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all of his drinks.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem of your idea.
You sound like you're the boss.
Do you want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does he look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
They're gonna die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When does your new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
Today it's snowy.
You made the promise to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue." "Who'll offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I walk all the time.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be an Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken.
He was supposed to do it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It'll clear up in the afternoon.
It became blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many continents in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.

I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He sounds the drum.
Must be hot.

Turn the candles on.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before we came to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.

She'll be on the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
You really think Tom's good?
I can't give Mary anything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
She hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of sugar-free tea.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, don't you know what I mean?
Keep out of the way.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to get this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.

He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.

The problem is we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut down the branch with an axe.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.

After dinner walk on the beach.

I thought Tom would be alive.
You've got bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.

Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your plate number?

We're listening to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell sounded.
Take him to the men in room 318.

Take off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.

He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.

They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Take the picture.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did he eat?

Why does Tom hate so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.

My shoes are wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
You're always liked by Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me questions?

He is experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
His table's ready.
Is it gonna be hot again tomorrow?

It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything that has been learned. It is disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is disease to be also obsessed with defense. It is disease to be also obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Fixing the mind obsessively on anything is considered disease.

Let me be his alibi.
He was walking slowly along the road.
It only takes 15 minutes, doesn't it?
They know who you are.

I found him lying on the bed.
I bought some flowers.
We just make uiguro food.
Be careful with them.
She doesn't respect him.
I just told her the truth.
I'm not a teacher anymore.

I'll give them the message.
The future has many names.

Tom, where did he learn French?
Did you give it to him?
Let's do it.
Please, sign my address.
I can't see her.
They feel hungry.
You don't say anything.
I read Tom's diary.
They came to the place that was revealed by God, and he set up an altar in the ancient way, and the wood was arranged just as he wanted it to happen to burn his son after he had killed him.
Bring us something to eat.
You have to go.

Ten million euros have been stolen.
We worked in the same room.
The forest became increasingly small, but the trees chose again and again the axe, because it was wise and could persuade the trees that was one of them thanks to its wooden handle.

Well, it's just a part of it.
We're really good.
Thank you.
There was no one in the hallway.

You can't be afraid to fail.
Were you really scared?
Relax, it's safe now.

You don't love.
Don't disappoint her.
Father doesn't work.
Mix the cards.
I was wondering if it was a case of buying a car.

Didn't you know I had a new car?
What helped you speak French so well?

Take the dog out.

Do you even have a vegetarian pizza?
We're investigating Tom's murder.
Without a doubt, every generation feels as if it were destined to rebuild the world. However, my knowledge that it will not rebuild it. But its role is probably greater; it implies preventing the world from self-destruct.
I can't get in.
Can we come with you?
Did I eat it?
It's not true that you watched TV.
That book's not yours, it's mine.
Why is Tom covered in mud?
I never met Mary.
"Where's my cake?" "Sorry, I ate it all."
Ask me if you don't understand.

You're working alone.
Tom tried to surprise Mary.
Talking is hard.

Welcome to our new home.

Didn't you know I had a new car?
I answered wrong.
Why are so many people xenophobic?

I admired his talent.
I don't want to eat today.
The musician is nowhere to be found.

Tom knows more than he thinks.
Yeah, I'm wearing my sleeping pajamas, aren't they all?
Is that your neighbor?
Don't worry, you're safe now.
It's bad education to eat with a knife.
It wasn't necessary at all.
Come here slowly.

It's okay to ask questions.
I know he's busy.
This is a story written in French.
Who's the president in your country?
Tom doesn't hear anything?
What is a great way to stay open, socialize, but also be safe in these pandemic times? For many people the obvious answer concerns water.
Can we come with you?
Do you have a room?
"Why did you choose to become a doctor, Tom?" "I always wanted to help people."
It's too hot in the summer.

And hang in there.
The pizza there was expensive.
Give me a sponge.
Tom went to Mary's house only to do homework together, but, since he was furious with a storm, his parents decided to let him spend the night there.

He can't be afraid to fail.
All the seats had already been taken.
My dad's out in the garden right now.
Pick up the dog.
Tom's helping me with house affairs.

I'm sure Tom told the truth.
She was dressed.
You're Chinese.
Tom and Mary have the same size.

Why do all your friends hate me?
Tom's fixing my car.
When does the summer break start?
You must be having fun at parties.

I miss the house.
My older sister won't leave me alone.
Tom cut off my thoughts.
Tom knows more than you think.
Let's all see the same sun.
I wasn't in love with anyone.
This drink tastes like cat!
Get the towel out of the bag.
"I was the first." "Really?"

That's right now.

We should wait for them.
It's a miracle she's still alive.
I'm paid every month.
I know exactly what your intention is.
There's someone at the front door who wants to thank you.
We want to help you with that.

Turn off the engine.
Where'd this come from, my girl?
My cat is really nice.
Whose baseball glove is it?
You're not as brave as you look.
Do you live alone in that huge house?
Her parents are really beautiful, but there's nothing special about her.
Why does she hate herself?
Looks like you learned a lot.
They do it first, it's better.
