Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown outbreak of etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, VOCID-19 causes a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to VOCID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the European Union countries/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of the Hubei province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons coming from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2019, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of the different countries and the WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of VOCID-19 within the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of cases of COVID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. with data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Developments in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
The cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases within the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally followed that of the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative impact of VOCID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
The cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable speed in all countries.
In spite of the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation purposes, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that about 10% of patients with IOCD-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of VOCID-19 cases to hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
However, systematic collection is needed to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised VOCID-19 cases associated with a risk of > 90% overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECPCM rapid risk assessment for VOCID-19.
Since the cases were so far grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally receive a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent ECPCM rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 by switching from an approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave sufficient time to decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, unless nothing has been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country can strengthen its monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a few patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, VOCID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will contribute to a better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the duration of the golden week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before expanding to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, VOCID-19 is "public enemy number one", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on VOCID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 showing the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize research progress on this new topic in full growth.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current VOCID-19 is therefore the third coronary virus epidemic of recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig..1, then unknown pneumonia outbreaks were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO described the outbreak as a global health emergency.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all of China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
To the extent that the situation is changing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very little less than 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was developing in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the outskirts.
The average duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large viruses wrapped with a single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to alpha and beta genera.
Spike (S) glycoprotein of the envelope is bound to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptide-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequential samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the sea fruit market from Huanan to Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using electron microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receiver of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is bound to the human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a protein secreted coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of INFβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human ACE2 cryo-ME structure with a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which presented open and closed conformations, was assembled as dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were passed on to Man via the civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two coronavirus types SARS from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., expressed the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would involve a homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-snake mammal feeding ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if considered by genetic homology at 99% performed between a coronavirus discovered in the pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a difference of importance, so it is necessary to wait for conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and for up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well have similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its inherent immune system through molecular motif recognition receptors (MRPs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll receptors (TLRs), NOD receptors (NLRs) and type IRIG-I receptors (RTRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can cause serious lung damage and other organs and, in the worst scenario, multivisceral failure or even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by an appearance in homes, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that it had an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine according to the most specific incubation period possible, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic persons.
Generally, people exposed to or infected with the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and the main symptom of COVID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
With regard to severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as patients with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had fever at 98%, dry cough at 76%, dyspnea at 55% and diarrhoea at 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on one family and one home following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MSR-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with higher lethality of the MERS compared to the COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SRM.
Regarding SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 cases confirmed globally.
Comparatively, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study carried out in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was to control the outbreaks of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered may be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the quarantine duration.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white number of blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimer rate, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or a depolitic glass opacity at lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchanges.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest tests often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 revealed a dequamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and SARS.
The detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological tests is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while attempting a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from re-established patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily addresses the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, to other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive reaction of the immune system has been found to cause cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of T-cell immune response, cytokine blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would result in severe side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting prognosis.
However, the prudent use of short cycles of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe VOCID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in a U.S. patient with VOCID-19.
Remedeivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remedeivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow for a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of re-established patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Restoring patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who healed from VOCID-19 and injected to 10 patients seriously affected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the plasma demand for treatment of severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from re-established patients and to identify genetic codes coding for the relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow for a rapid increase in antibody production.
The MTC has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theories of the TCM.
Most effective components remain little or no known as it is difficult to extract and check them, or know their best associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective VOCID-19 treatment, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate or remission symptoms of severe disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proved effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 have been observed in China provinces that used TCM for 87 per cent of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7 per cent), Ningxia Region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei Province, which used only 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (WMO) only and combination treatment involving MO and TCM.
It appeared that the return time to normal body temperature, the delay in the disappearance of symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through larger-scale controlled testing and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidity have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the VOCID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of the sick with regard to the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with VOCID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support must include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to halt the transmission chain of animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and in models subject to lethal provocation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably because SARS went out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the sick gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a model of prognosis is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this also appears to be the case for VOCID-19.
VOCID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30-65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years according to a study conducted in 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 to 51 years), suggesting age as a predictive factor for patients with VOCID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with VOCID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may result in liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Anomalous laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CRP) rate in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of the disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity and the COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help to establish prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue injury.
They are therefore traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of VOCID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an add-on for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used for severe SARS cases, many survivors have had avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid administration to patients with VOCID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the VOCID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of exceptional stress cases, often patients with long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, as well as the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and restore a normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, VOCID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or cause symptoms in the first stage of infection, like coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, recently infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Considerable efforts are being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declines, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than the SARS, will not be extinguished by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the samples of the middle nasal corneal and restored patients, 2 weeks after their discharge from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial forecasts, the Ebola virus was expected to lead to up to one million cases and one half million deaths.
However, thanks to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally put under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity to eventually turn off or evolve into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in saddles, revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Caution should therefore be exercised in order to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even any person likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (1860) provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions able to penetrate fully; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the sized SARS-CoV, since both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted isolation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus could have penetrated his organism by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health care professionals should also bring transparent visions or protective glasses to the contact of patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with soap that is more often disinfected than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected persons.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre would reassure the population by claiming that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited inter-human communicableity and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take the necessary steps.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the unusual data from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) conduct more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system regularly.
The epidemic of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of drafting this report, it extended to all of China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of VOCID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the VOCID-19 epidemic gives rise to an impression of an already-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people.
SARS has higher mortality than in COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of VOCID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular NRA testing of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for some patients with VOCID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may again be positive for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in research on VOCID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly into respiratory cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long is the epidemic going to last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all of these and many others.
However, regardless of the expenses that this must entail, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients experienced severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first SARS case dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Not counting the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, miscarriage of liver function and high creatinine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in the event of suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tracts, several organs including gastrointestinal tracts, liver and kidneys may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunosuppressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunosuppressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present around the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is globally present, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain continuously in man, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of the MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from SRM also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of SRM in relation to HCV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly human viruses.
Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread throughout the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in samples of saddles.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-term diffusion after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current VOCID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more important the number of people infected is, the more likely the virus is to adapt completely to humans.
If it adapts well, transmission between men will be difficult to stop by some quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal tank.
On the other hand, the SARS-CoV and the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV did not adapt well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCV.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without the animal host reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCV, we will be very useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCV.
An animal serves as an evolving host of an HCoV if it houses a nearby ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogen for its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host houses the HCoV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a host natural reservoir.
In particular, since 80% of Guangzhou animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplified hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
The converting enzyme of human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
That is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromadarians were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as were camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also by faecal route, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than the distance between beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be derived from bat CoV, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hippoderiros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near the HCOV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpaca, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alpha-CoV of the HCOV-229E related bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in the bats, while alpha-CoV of the alpaca caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In reality, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit the HCV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of bats serve as a genetic reservoir of the HCoV-229E, alpaca and dromadaria could serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromadaries and dromadaries to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in dromadarians for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels which have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin's beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via pickling or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the host intermediate amplifiers to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through breeding and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals including domestic animals may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded NRA viruses, estimated mutation rates of VOCs could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the adaptation phase of the VOC to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of the CoVs are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the dromadaires.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against short-term ineffective SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, the CoVs change randomly and frequently model when replicating the RNA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as for CoV observed in animals such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit means that the affinity of this protein S with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10-20-fold greater affinity of this binding compared to that observed between the ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receiver may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, the HCoV-NL63 also binds to the ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and host natural reservoirs of HCV, such as bats, dromadaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the start box
The diversity of bat CoV offers many opportunities for emerging new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCV.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV related bat viruses were isolated, but they codified divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion turns the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in Dromadaria in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in rattle and camel viruses associated with HCV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their host reservoir.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclide, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombining, generating the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that the secret of asymptomatic carrier observation and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
For example, administration of type I interferon in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
While a bat CoV beta sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS CoV-2.
Notably similar to SARS-CoV-2 pangolin beta-CoV have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs returned to the ramp light due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of SRM, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against SRM-CoV in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, with very high zoonotic potential.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches of zoonoses natural reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how do humans come into contact with bats?
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it's bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identic parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold may be contracted, for example, by omitting to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical goal of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterial, virus or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap hand washing.
Pneumonia, one of the leading AKIs, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Handwashing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could result in hand eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent in health workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
Dispersal twice a year, associated with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Single water is not an effective skin cleaner since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are hardly soluble in water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protection agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (Acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.Disinfectants for hands containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of communicable gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soap or detergents.
Allergenic dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic materials on the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for alcohol-free hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have had a long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of slowing them down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Move a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The fruttering action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs from the skin, and to rub more germs for a longer time.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water tank can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
Wet and wet hands are easier to recapitulate.The most frequently forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, gap between fingers and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and square nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a drum or a suspended and pierced gourd and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanger with a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Efficient hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
Following the washing and drying of hands in hot air dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the pulp of the fingers and by 254% on the palms.
Drying in air-jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After drying the hands, the following variations in the bacterial number were observed:
There are many different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands wet and rub.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of handwashing in health structures is to remove the pathogens ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from passing to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term "handwashing" refers to a person's refusal to accept responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
and all chest pains should be treated in this way, especially at your age

Do you still have pain in your chest?
Because it's the flu season
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which most likely follow the pressure exerted during the selection, especially by the host's immune system.
One example is the loss of complete ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in rattle and camel viruses associated with HCV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their host reservoir.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is eliminated by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules in the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclide, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombining, generating the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that the secret of asymptomatic carrier observation and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
For example, administration of type I interferon in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat CoV beta sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the markets have been discovered as carriers of viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Notably similar to SARS-CoV-2 pangolin beta-CoV have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although issues remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs returned to the ramp light due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCV to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
As infection with SARS-CoV stems from contact between humans and cevets on the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of cevets that are found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of numerous beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of SRM, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against SRM-CoV in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, with very high zoonotic potential.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the damage caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to the spread of viruses, the probability for man to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches of zoonoses natural reservoirs.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how do humans come into contact with bats?
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it's bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identic parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will shed light on the evolving trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspecting case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been called acute acute respiratory syndrome severe to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was posted online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a great deal of attention since its publication.
However, please note that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have had seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially changed.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a proposal for a simple assessment based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work should also be updated in accordance with the latest Guidelines for Diagnostic and Treatment of VOCID-19 (Standard Trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspicious case must be associated with one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases cluster (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a VOCID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the whole viral genome with a strong homogeneity with known new coronavirus; (3) positive serum test for the IgM and IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or in blood sampling was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sampling was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal kit for the detection of nucleic acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory pathways including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified individuals with no clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and future studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh Announces Five New Deaths Related to COVID-19, a Daily Record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
In this way, the country records a single-day mortality record due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of contaminated individuals included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Throughout the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for an extension of the 15-day state of national emergency; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the tendency to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an HIV infection could be.
Most of the HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate hosts of some HCOVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also allow a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified as four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genus of the Bêta-CoV contains the majority of the HCVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The remaining five beta-CoV include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The mapping of zoonotic origins of HCV provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of species barrier crossing.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the host(s) reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
The CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Over the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E presented symptoms of classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malignancy and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present throughout the world and appear to be broadcast mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia Reduce Limits of Toilet Paper by Purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chains of stores Woolworths and Coles have reduced their purchase restrictions to two toilet paper and one package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the funds and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently gathered reserves because of the fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to a package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, stated that with the restriction of four existing packages, "many stores are still stock breaking in the hour after delivery," and called the application "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales experienced a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
Costco in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailer Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times make the task difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores restock every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky article, resulting in stocks of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [buried] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce panic," said Russell Zimmerman at ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock breakage.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures the Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper to the first auctioner in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hygiene products for hands and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British Ocado online supermarket limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 reels.
The World Health Organization qualifies COVID-19 as a pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned, not only by alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also by alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unparalleled".
He stated in CNN's February statement that "other than influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added, "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To make the situation short, the situation will get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20 is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confining suspected people to be infected.
The authorities around the world reacted by putting in place restrictions on travel, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk checks and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by the acquisition of panic.
Schools and universities have closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei province) reported an unknown outbreak of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan sea fruit wholesale market and it is therefore believed that the virus would be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person who presented symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious link with the future home of the fresh products market.
In the case of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from the Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a high underestimation of cases, especially among those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among youth, 19-year-olds and up to 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. The UK Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before being able to achieve effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of persons tested at the COVID-19, whose test was confirmed positive according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had for official policies not to test those with only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, until January 23, China estimated 86% of non-detected VOCID-19 infections, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of VOCID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are healing.
For those who do not heal, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent were pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those deceased who have been tested positive to the COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of VOCID-19 could be much higher, as it might not include those who died untested - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy indicate that the figures of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the deaths of the COVID.
A spokesperson for the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is under-estimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the underassessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, as the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary across regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-decease ratio is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the death report estimates decreased by 17.3% (for symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of contaminants (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) that succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall pandemic infection rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on lethality estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and definitive duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Without control, usually infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to return when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant predictions at the moment when it will occur."
China's Chief Medical Advisor Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College, a physical distance and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—is completely disappearing" and that "it could become a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year".
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of VOCID-19 are sometimes rather non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of odour, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, then researchers made recommendations that people who had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) oscillates between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of persons carrying VOCID-19 who lost odorate was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and through fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that unprotected tossing can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through fine droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected when expiring, including by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people located next to them or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus result in airborne spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, especially the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has excluded the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms suggest that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of confirmed asymptomatic cases in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during the contact investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive at the COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, but the British authorities recommend that they wash their hands after affecting animals, such as after having been in contact with areas other than infected people might have affected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the home of cases of acute respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (linen B) associated with two strains of bats.
It is 96% identical to the genome of another batCov RaTG13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequence between pangolin and human viruses.
Comparison of the genome as a whole has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected or scanned secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and the scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first intention test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually this test is carried out on a rhinopharynx sample but it is also possible to use a gorge sample. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on radiographs and tomodensitometry (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral depolia glass opacity and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited precision to detect VOCID-19.
A major study in China compared chest scanner results to PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in imaging both on X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include generally having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief, then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who would have been contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have banned or advised all non-essential displacements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads to communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals are advised to take care of someone who may be infected to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. Contact searching is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile localization data by governments in this regard has raised confidentiality concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limitations on such monitoring.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinse the nose and strove with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against VOCID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having bitten, having coughed, or sneezed.
It is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62%–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or crèche, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by the sick are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbow or a handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and to throw out any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected posts by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended for those who care for a person who is potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended the wearing of masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they deal with a patient with the COVID-19, even if they recognize that the wearing of the mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to manufacture and clean facial masks at home every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned exits in public without masks or other means of covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone can protect himself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered everyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers of trains and long-distance buses on 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, saluting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of the gatherings recommended by the U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of VOCID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and the CDC was invited to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contacts by maintaining social ties, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggests that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sexual intercourse only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed with positive VOCID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals in the most at-risk groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to place themselves in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Epidemic control strategies are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Indigo is established during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Deployment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Elimination requires more extreme measures to inflate the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantines; public social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning; and more drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China as long as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced localized mass screening and quarantine, and has issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and penalized the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and elimination (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and half deaths, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The elimination can be preferred, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise the transmission bounces rapidly when the measurements are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VOCID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without a prescription against cold or drinking as well as resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with VOCID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines to primary hospitals and health care services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to the VOCID-19 tests, by cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive to VOCID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the very first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in the province of the Hubei in China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital in the province of Hubei, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "Koronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January. At the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major rail correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by posting the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364 000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and border controls.
National responses included measures of indigo such as quarantine (also called orders to stay at home, on-site shelter or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, close to 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subjected to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, approximately 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide knew a form of confinement, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of unknown pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "provoking rumors" about the epidemic.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "manifest evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to end the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop the journeys from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting approximately 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat the additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other facilities to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the epidemic of COVID-19, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of spring holidays.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have put in place a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transportation has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been involved in some form or other of travel restriction. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had passed inside the country within five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.

On 22 February, among the 9,336 church faithful, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, then 3 150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
The timetables of the airlines were also reached and thus modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population to the virus, and isolate all infected people as well as to monitor and quarantine the people who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile application, virus screening drives delivering results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's programme is seen as a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and liveliness in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, not advising all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment halls.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and sports halls had to close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' salaries, within £2,500 per month, to avoid unemployment related to the crisis.

Despite this, the United States took time to start testing, which concealed the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were initiated by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government for non-governmental screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (order of a mandatory physician later).

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and management of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that had hindered prevention and indigestion efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that although it was "certainly not a recommendation from WHO", it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of an "unprecedented fact in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO stated that the epidemic was an emergency of international public health (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked in the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to travel restrictions, Tedros said: "There is no reason why measures may interfere with international travel and trade unnecessary" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have the systems necessary to detect the people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to come."
Tedros then said that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest or pay more tomorrow."On 11 February, the WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response."
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which according to WHO will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO was set up in China to dispatch international and WHO experts in China to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" through workshops and meetings with key national institutions and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", stating that although it is too early to talk about pandemics, each country should nevertheless enter "preparation phase".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent an on-site joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global risk assessment of coronavirus had shifted from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a declaration would mean that "we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticism of its inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late reporting of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging the Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts focused on respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The experts emphasized that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations deal with the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on political responses in the various countries of the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of Michael Gove and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) have been relieved of their duties as a result of their management of quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronary virus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronary virus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories claiming that COVID-19 would have its origins from the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration described the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that in China, "censorship has over-charged a virus now a global pandemic," which was then taxed on racism by some opponents and is intended to "return attention from the inability of his administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast sought a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the broad lines of a communication strategy apparently emerging from the National Security Council, the strategy of which is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including during press conferences and television appearances." News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU Head of Foreign Policy Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also stated that "China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
Other conflicts related to masks have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of breathers for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity".
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "not even useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitic and diplomatic" charm offensive.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft to the United States for medical assistance.
The spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutine] assumes that when the American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have gained speed, they will be able to make it so necessary."
The magnitude of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the exercise Defend 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about twenty members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the presidential election of 2020. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after it has announced that any person arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on designated government sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be accused of mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or, on the contrary, commending its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree until further notice, to suspend the parliament and the elections and to punish anyone who would be accused of broadcasting false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the acquisition of panic and the interruption of the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings about drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and vendor interruption.
Several localities have also faced purchases of panic resulting in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This application led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for Dalagous to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food that ensued, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been anticipated in Europe and North America.
As a result of its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not notice a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government opened pork reserves to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to allow food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy were felt in China: a media report of March 16, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 because of the government's measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures put in place in a timely manner by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did during the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against all travel around the world.
Therefore, many airlines cancelled flights due to a decline in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivities, and private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland, independently.
Many events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the banned Beijing City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until 10 February, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has gone to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year's festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in opening hours of stores or temporary closures.

The operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in conditions of extreme poverty in Latin America in relation to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large proportion of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stuck at home in domestic provinces or stuck in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (received a daily wage) to unemployment. Angus Reid's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees switch to a government-funded partial activity facility called Kurzarbeit.
The German compensation scheme for part-time work was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Arts and Culture Organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often financed by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed to a new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online, live or on television, while others propose to practice their worship in "driving-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter's, which was emptied of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medine.
The pandemic has caused the largest disruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were initially due to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "planned beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have found a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been affected, with several bands of music that have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway theatres, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue creating and sharing their work on the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, either online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, the inhabitants of the first European country to undergo a severe epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban the Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has angered on Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and a student in large Indian cities would have been harassed in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bharatiya Bengal-Wester unit Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them."
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which described them as "false."In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were triggered by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "delegated".
Many paid access newspapers removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibodie detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported fatalities, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
By using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal sprain or expectoration sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal spawning is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a crate (expectation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with a reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the authorization of emergency use of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PC-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their RT-PCR real-time diagnostic device for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the former versions of the test kits, one out of three genetic tests obtained non-conclusive results due to faulty reagents, as well as a bottleneck of the Atlanta CDC tests. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and this is only when federal and local laboratories were given permission to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based VOCID-19 tests.
This Diagnostics also distributed national VOCID-19 tests on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sampling and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the VOCID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was granted FDA approval for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, thus allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (U.S.A.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA USA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses the isotherm amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to step up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically related to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can deliver results in 15-20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature study in March 2020 concluded that "Lung X-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of MDT [tomodedensitometry] may be conclusive before symptoms occur".
Typical symptoms visible on MDT include multi-lobular bilateral depole glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the source of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that "the MDR is not used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose VOCID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and in the context of population surveillance.The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CTL) or by testing at the patient's bedside (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For LCT, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and who, therefore, can now distribute their antibody testing tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.By March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country was effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients spit inside, return it and receive the test result later.The UK NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test the suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the VOCID-19 test drive for suspicious cases, a health professional will take a sample taking appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians declared on March 2 that it had the ability to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that at 12/20 a total of 483,295 samples were tested until 12/20 a week and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of the samples of 64 patients at the same time, collecting samples and testing only if the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of emergency detection of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese:
Thanks to its construction within 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the BGI founder, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1 122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-manipulating robot.
In March, insufficient reagent shortages and quantities have become a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory with Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for producing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020.The protocol developed by the United States Centres for Disease Control was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of testing in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private laboratories in the United States, and the stocks of chemical waste and reagents have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "failures".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the kits that have given the wrong results, and will replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased in China 1.2 million test kits that have proved to be faulty.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Turkish Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieve a positive result and the tracing of those who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, has given positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death linked to the COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two series of tests for the entire population of about 3,400 people, about 10 days apart.
Nearly half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened on the scheduled date at the end of the vacation on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the highest number of tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower levels of lethality, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of VOCID-19 send their first five positive samples and 10 first negative samples of VOCID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only persons admitted to the hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap to some "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by an oro-fecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold may be contracted, for example, by omitting to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby's butt or changing her layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after caring for a sick person;
After changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after coughing or coughing/sneezing;
after having affected an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering drugs or providing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical goal of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterial, virus or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improved hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap hand washing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate due to these diseases by nearly 50%.
The introduction of actions to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that achieved by supplying low-income areas with drinking water.
Washing your hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading AKIs, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by nearly half the deaths due to diarrhea and by about a quarter the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could result in hand eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent in health workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (myction, dissection), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or change its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, particularly before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or mowing, after affecting animal waste or handling animals and after having been affected by garbage.
In many countries, the rate of cleaning of soap hands is low.
According to a 2015 hand hygiene study of 54 countries, 38.7% of households on average were hand-washed with soap. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate (97%) in Saudi Arabia was the highest, the United States was in the middle of a table (77%) and China was the lowest (23%). There are now several methods to change behaviours and democratize the use of soap for hand-washing at key times of the day. It is particularly possible in developing countries to offer schoolchildren to wash their hands at specific times of the day so that children can become accustomed to doing so.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a "primary health care program" to promote children's health and education.
Dispersal twice a year, associated with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Single water is not an effective skin cleaner since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are hardly soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nevertheless indicates that "the automatic liquid soap dispensers are preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to individuals concerned with their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protection agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous alcohol-based hand hygiene products (e.g. hydro-alcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (Acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.Disinfectants for hands containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria present in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of communicable gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be bordered for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The tips of the fingers should also be cleaned by rubbing them, paume versus paume.The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soap or detergents.
Allergenic dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand-washing water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic materials on the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for alcohol-free hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have had a long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, and rather use ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of slowing them down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be properly washed to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Move a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The fruttering action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs from the skin, and to rub more germs for a longer time.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water tank can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
Wet and wet hands are easier to recapitulate.The most frequently forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, gap between fingers and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and square nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a drum or a suspended and pierced gourd and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanger with a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Efficient hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the entire paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers, and more modern air-jet day-to-days.
Following the washing and drying of hands in hot air dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the pulp of the fingers and by 254% on the palms.
Drying in air-jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a cross-contamination potential with other toilet users and the toilet environment based on each drying method.
The air-jet hand-dryer, which blows from the air outside the device at speeds announced 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel the microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other users of the toilet as well as the bathroom environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air-dryer allows micro-organisms to be broadcast at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the water-dryer.
Paper napkins revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand-drying methods were evaluated.
After drying the hands, the following variations in the bacterial number were observed:
There are many different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in medical settings has become mandatory well after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) to prevent diseases in hospital.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in lower rates of infection.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands wet and rub.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
As the germs present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid reconnecting hands to contact surfaces.
The goal of handwashing in health structures is to remove the pathogens ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing hands properly and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to gather feedback from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Available devices in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Directions" for Hand Hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (so-called "medical" or "antimicrobial") provides the hand washing agent with action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To "frote" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching the hands, a chlorhexidine- or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from passing to the hands.
Once your hands are washed, you should dry your hands using a sterile cloth and put on a surgical jacket.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
When comparing handwashing with regular soap with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing handwashing with alcohol-based solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first decreases bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and difficult Clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to send them written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap handwashing is considered to be a inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health and even feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash their hands at home, at school and at the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal habits in hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soapy handwashing and sensitizing in this regard can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of this practice and lead to a change in long-term behaviour within the population.
This approach requires monitoring and evaluation activities.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting handwashing in schools, we can cite the example of UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years earned (i.e., DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the HIVIC-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to protect themselves against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term "handwashing" refers to a person's refusal to accept responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It came from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression spread widely in certain English communities.
In Macbeth, from Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she has committed and that she has incited her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering to have committed acts contrary to ethics or considering doing so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand-washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the washing rituals of the hands put forward in many religions, including Bahaïsm and Hinduism, immersion (avilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash their hands after going to the toilet.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls of VOCID-19 at the workplace
The risk controls of VOCID-19 at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risk of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to VOCID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain large-scale retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with VOCID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, to be at very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or to collect or manipulate samples of persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical checks such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
Epidemics of COVID-19 may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means to acquire them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the dispatch of articles from geographically severely affected regions by VOCID-19 may be interrupted. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
Plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community risk factors and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for potential post-epidemic situations.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of an epidemic response include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a comprehensive framework used in occupational health and safety in order to pool risk controls effectively.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical checks, followed by administrative checks and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Technical controls mean that employees are isolated from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPS) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help to prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly worn and systematically inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, low exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures for prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory labeling, including covering their mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, telework preparation or step-by-step working hours, deterring workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain at home until they no longer have fever, fever or any other symptom for at least 24 hours without the use of fertilizers or other symptoms-related medications, and also advise to apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m) of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic toilet windows and the installation of a drift window for the client service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher-risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings in person by virtual communications, the setting up of phased working hours, the interruption of non-essential travel to areas with individual epidemics of COVID-19 active, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum to address workers' concerns, the provision of phased working hours, the interruption of travels to areas with individual or active working conditions, the development of emergency communications plans, including a forum to address workers' concerns, the provision of information workers and the provision of state-of-of-of-the-of-the-day protection measures for the protection of workers, the

Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose using handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall carry disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include the deferral of travel in the event of illness as well as self-insulation and immediate information from the onboard medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop once aboard.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare, CDCs recommend short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has gone to a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate Community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education courses or meals at the canteen, by increasing the space between offices, by staggering the time of arrival and departure, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate infirmary for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission to the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement forces performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by CDCs.
Law enforcement officers who must contact persons with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed must follow the same guidelines as ambulance officers, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt prior to re-use by means of a cleaning cloth or spray, clean and follow the standard procedures for containment and discarding used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or manipulations of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funeral employment includes workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they practice autopsy. The additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including in the conduct of procedures that produce aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some sanitary and funerary environments.
Samples must be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known infection by SARS-CoV-2 and those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filtration respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including medical adaptation, training and examination.
Other types of respiratory masks can ensure superior protection and better comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial screen, blouse and gloves.
In case of a procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
As the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COVID-19 patient to persons directly involved in its care, the use of PPE required for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

PURPOSE: [Covy-19] Reduce burden and prepare for the future
DATE/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in electronic mail, instant calls and conversations are a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to all of you for being among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me of his gratitude to our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the coming days and months.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to back off, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our objective of daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until new order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, do shopping or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should go without saying, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or leave with pay required: simply prevent your superior and help your team to review schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed at COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department to help T&amp;C and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully remunerated.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities for our subcontractors and colleagues as members of the staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't do any harm later.
We do not intend to "work twice again to catch up with the lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to make overtime to meet time delays now unrealistic.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What about APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set up a budget to enable employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines greatly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the VOCID-19 virus.
However, due to excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and lift cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a place in WeWork, which shared with us and all staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration according to the advice of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our regular colleagues from work at a distance are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to give you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are necessary, consider dividing them over several days.
Set the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for snacks.
Join the channel #remoties on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support increased labour distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed subsidy activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or amended.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
For the next, the CRT is working on the creation of a page on Méta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to the COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members residing in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, significant workflows or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the TRC.

None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a question of recognizing that at the present time, our work and our obligations will probably need to be adjusted in an unprecedented manner.
These are the steps that we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there to wait for us next time.
For the time being, it is time to get together and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, that is why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself the moment you come.
Finally, if you like: wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestine cells.
The ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of N-minus peptide and a C-minus renal amino acid transporter.
The ACE2 is a single-passing membrane protein type I, whose enzyme active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ACE2 is evaporated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: the ACE2 is linked to the cellular membrane mainly cells of type II lung alveols, enterocytes of the large intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNAm is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
ACE clives the angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
The ACE2 clive in turn the amino acid phenylamine with an angiotensin II carboxyl termination (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and angiotensin vasodilator (1-7) hydrolysis (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also clench several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensiin, dynorphine A, and ghréline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of some coronavirus, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that originated from SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that originated from COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 protein of spicule of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of the ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by the host serum protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the host protein is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended that standard treatment be continued with the help of ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less likely than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is perceived as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in man is about 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or to diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 under infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the identification of persons ("contacts") that may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the government's official support in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracing the geographical location of users of applications, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed in China an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application to trace exposure to potentially infected people and communicate quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the use of contact tracing was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a georeferencing application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, discussed several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including flaws and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat was removed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a declaration calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have laid down eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating VOCID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
Digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Protections against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in cases of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple is intended to address the problem of the persistence of monitoring by removing the mechanism for tracing the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to raw geolocation data have important privacy concerns.
However, all central server-based systems do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for tracing contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including trace data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made localization information accessible to the public, which was allowed as a result of profound changes to the privacy laws of the information after the outbreak of MERS that affected the country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
The details had not yet been communicated on April 6, 2020.
The tracing of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy solutions, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols encompass Decentralized Privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracting (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all mails are made to the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy technologies when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of the COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would allow privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to allow governments to create official privacy-respected coronavirus tracing applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and deleting it later in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a drug (also referred to as reorientation, reprophylation, reassignment or change in the therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of an approved drug for a disease or medical condition other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research area that is currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for VOCID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these liaison sites offers the realistic development project of an effective antiviral drug against VOCID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, papain protein, dependent RNA polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribose phosphatase are found.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that tests by the New York State on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorisation (U.S.A.).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians have indicated that they use this medication "when there are no other options".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is slim and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the medication in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the medication to university hospitals where the medication would be used to treat patients with VOCID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to breed.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would be related to SARS-CoV-2 protein. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity trial.
Remedeivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remedeivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several phylovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies suggest that remedeiving may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by university hospitals in Cleveland; one involving people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with VOCID-19; two controlled against placedobo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A phase II test of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is being conducted with 200 patients recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of VOCID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with positive VOCID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women who do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as VOCID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against the disease virus SARS-CoV-2, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was declared worldwide in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms led research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets in phase I security studies include:
Nucleic Acid (ADN and RNA) (Developer Phase I and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (presumed under planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against positionabo and performed in several centers while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Among the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in "preclinical").
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
About January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it started working on a vaccine, which is expected to start in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his partner in biotechnology, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedure, it would take about one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported developing a particle similar to coronavirus through the partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is in the course of laboratory research, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong sums of money to receive exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which prompted the German government's protest.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a RNAm vaccine.
The vaccine candidate for NRAm BNT162 is currently in the preclinical phase with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium to seek a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against VOCID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the vaccine sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against VOCID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C to develop a vaccine against VOCID-19 with projects to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, claiming that "the subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro- needles triggered a significant response from specific antigen antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a DNA vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM's supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted computer resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is expected to include 4 170 health professionals.
Vaccines currently developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against a MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines were in progress; all vaccines were viral, two had adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one had MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus that originated the VOCID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While most cases lead to moderate symptoms, some progress towards viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
These droplets are produced at an expiring time, usually falling to the ground or on surfaces rather than representing an infectious risk over long distances.
People may also get infected by affecting a contaminated surface, then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although the infection is possible before the onset of symptoms and during the subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the wearing of masks by the public in general vary, some authorities discontinuing their use, others recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for VOCID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of WHO.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, suffocation.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or chest pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Uncommon, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, several organs failure, and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people without symptoms is currently unknown and studied. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDCs) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections observed today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
The expectoration and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
Talking loudly frees more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that tossing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside patients' chambers have produced positive samples to viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to aerial propagation.
Although there are concerns about seed propagation, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected at the end of a day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on copper at 99%.
This varies, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap based products degrade the lipid layer protecting the virus, which disables it and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the onset of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, whereas in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the home of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) that is the most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "picule" (plomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of those admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T-cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with VOCID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which are likely to detect active infections and an individual's previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed a precision of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test at the nearest of the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral depole glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar lining) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleura, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytary hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia during healing: organization of exsudats in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands at water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
A correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face by means of a tissue in public places, in order to limit the transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacement and cancelling large groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "placing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having bitten, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available.For areas where trade-based disinfectants are not available, the WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an active antiseptic substance for hands".
The glycerol is added as moistening.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support from other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those with moderate symptoms at an early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized individuals for VOCID-19.
Resuscitators and pneumologists in the U.S. collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen at the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, in particular in conditions of care when performing procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people suffering from VOCID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an airborne isolation chamber (IIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and aviation transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (IMP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks) are preferred.
Respiratory masks N95 are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (U.S.A.).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
Where masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protection screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons suffering from respiratory failure related to VOCID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Some evidence indicates that intubation may be avoided by using a high-speed nasal canal or positive pressure from double-level airways.
It is not known whether either of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles to a high-speed nasal canal. Severe cases are more frequent in older adults (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 that are serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during VOCID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control modes and a high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remedeiving seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs in the course of testing are already approved in other indications and the tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary plasma authorization for convalescents as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using monitoring data and therefore to detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-care, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of persons suspected of having the coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate telephone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile telephone operators that "40% of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of severe infection with VOCID-19 based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but data for VOCID-19 are not available. In some cases, VOCID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, VOCID-19 can rapidly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiviscer failure.
Complications associated with VOCID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and heart, kidney and liver lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of cases hospitalized with VOCID-19, with renal failure occurring in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have a high rate of hepatic enzyme (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range between six and 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples have a diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart lesions due to high troponin rates or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region could also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The under-reporting of moderate cases may lead to over-estimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases previously contracted may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of IVOC-19 and present a 2.4 times higher risk of going into intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns also appeared in relation to long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital administration of Hong Kong has seen a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to post-intensive post-healing syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether an earlier infection had effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, on the basis of the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of cured persons of COVID-19 followed by positive tests of coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered aggravation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only carried out by human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary across regions and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory confirmed deaths of infection at SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for case deaths of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/cass ratio is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF), which reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although all infected people do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men 50 years old, the difference between men and women disappearing only at 90 years old.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent among men and 1.7 per cent among women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be included.
Immunological differences according to sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the deceased people of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of infections in VOCID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species, or a group of people, in accordance with international recommendations of nomenclature to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes VOCID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as scrubbers and respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup reconstituted and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against VOCID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these researches focus on spicule S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique of vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of one vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied to the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on recontinuing it in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine candidates and drugs against VOCID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including remedevir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of re-adhesiveness in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remedeivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are under way in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some seek independent analysis of research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of physicians caring for patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with serum transmembrane protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at later stages of severe VOCID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
He is undergoing a non-randomized phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the cause of the death of some affected persons.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the resergating syndrome of steroid-refractory cytokines induced by a different cause, CAR T cell, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of persons who have healed from VOCID-19 to persons who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinational method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mode of action expected by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Serum production of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then hired and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
