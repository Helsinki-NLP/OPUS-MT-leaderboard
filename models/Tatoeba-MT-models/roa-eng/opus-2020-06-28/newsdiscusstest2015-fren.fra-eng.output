The remaining UKIPs who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to do tails behind intolerant chronic hypochondria who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing cunnings, does not exist at all.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel UKIP universe can Carswell appear to be a revolutionary.
A summons from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
Neither do you know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence has been very surprising, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media is talking about what you don't like.
It is so rare to talk about it because, unlike Farage and her crazy Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that humanity's complexities are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation in Ireland as well as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity will have nothing arranged.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''TIGRE DE LA EUROPE'' was boasting us a few years ago.
We met in the suite!
This recommends reading the article.
We are trying to make it believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a new 'ECONOMIC MIRACLE' is occurring.
With the Brussels agreement, impotents on the lowest companies in Europe, a flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients no '' pavoise'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twenty-first century, irritating was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the Portuguese In considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is in view of recent events.
Lower tax rates in Europe?
It's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on impots actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to have been drawn out in 2008 or 2009, it pays less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the return.
Is it supposed to be economic?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an A140 hangover.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once it's refined.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers an extra fee for the additional fear that they had to be provided?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy about it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic tariff have only to take it on their own, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs caused by this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a nice trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and the gang literally from the world.
People don't come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (mostly anyone) or the Review Salon at the White-Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that stores are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With a lot of foreigners who spend .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday is going to create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, filled with world with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would appear admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is clouded by the fact that they purchase in relief.
The tourist areas lose a considerable turnover each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister responsible for the economy nor, of course, the minister responsible for foreign affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
As long as they lock her up.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday.
To Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
I'm sure his estate would want his share of the cake, if you'd give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he held the heads of the other government's aristos who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he had very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect money from the estate expenses, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure projects being by definition unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real evil of France: the mistrust of dialogue
Back to prince values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has done so in exchange for the services he renders or has made available to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who sees income from his property.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return to retirement and those who live on their pensions.
A good to rent or even two for a couple on top, that's vice
The small genius of Finance is simply unimaginable.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way could a new deal be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of the decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage decline so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less acute, then the need for investment is demanding: isolation, refurbishment of the rail network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc.
A tax that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a Galopin.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all those phones and decided on LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them options, functionality and price are higher.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Stop looking for "better platform".
Is there a "best car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and must be encouraged.
This is of interest to all of us.
I am glad that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that it is not an Apple product, even if I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our Umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian fools ) could tell us what author(s) they are fighting ideas about the genre and tell us the books they are about to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in The Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Is their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmur?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultivated.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein, referring to Holoferne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his vibrancy of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you're going back there, this subject doesn't interest me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith to Holoferne, it does.
Who's scared is asking for the World?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first is by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by qualifying Judith Butler as a very symbolic slit of the throat.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimate of them.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read ,Jean ,that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pringing to fight ideas from the only presentation that their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our upfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not, moreover, that the nuance is understood.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic slit of the throat, I was content with the "Twelfth Sex" (it was more than my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated the disappointment of having sometimes the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really fit the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of Australia's rest had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make the Work responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessing, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with the rain of Perseid meteors and for almost all the major astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I begin to think that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observatory, even though things get much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10-20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO watches this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (forcedly) ends up disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions, looking for messages in which people criticize Abbott and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Superb photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going into collision with the Earth!
Nothing on stock speculation and real estate.
There is nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital incomes.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Go to today Tuesday 15 October to see the results of the miracle revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
Yet, it seems to be the examples to follow.
Notaries reform would generate an amount of €8 billion in compensation.
The Department of Economic Affairs tells us that these claims are not well founded.
What if the Ministry of Economic Affairs made a mistake?
Will decision-makers have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL.
@lol No The state is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it helps finance material and intangible investments in future growth and thus future revenue.
Some of the answers.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrate's sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice plot theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the inculcated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money on drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors Do Not Win Money With Liberals Wanting Our Health System To Be Similar to the United States, you should learn how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the mob, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and "research".
Read the few reports about our expenditures on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare world prices of medicines everywhere, as well as differences from one country to another on what is on sale or only on prescription.
This reinforces this is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhaling against oncologic pain, despite the laws that hinder it and the necessary expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who achieve a version of good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on in the backstage for doctors and medicine.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't keep patents on grass...
If social science researchers did research instead of politics and networking, they could be used "work".
One investigator investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
To compare is not to look.
To compare is to do no pedagogy of research.
We can't say "search is done we have to apply it" and then in the same jet "we have to experiment at all costs".
If your research is completed, why experiment?
If your research isn't completed, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they were unable to learn?
The pisa tests are just one indicator, let us do an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the use of building a sign that informs you of what arranges for you, a self-promoting will, a deception?
A single track to train teachers: to distance sophists and ideologies from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
"It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow the system to advance."
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system it is not possible to wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
To give more weight to theorists of education would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally fierce: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like even less to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about it.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member for the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, it will suffice me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright violation = vol.
This is the same because they must quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not at all.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive the artists of their breadwinner.
You can still debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be true anyway.
It is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
Clearly, you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am glad to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource we're rowing, the grunt who says it's all wrong....
If it is a PS MP who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children, and when they are about to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing changed.
France shoots people down and constantly assists them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is the speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had CHANCE to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the bosses I often meet.
At ease in my basketballs I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the awful truth!
@gus, when comparing with the German companies that the French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany the companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium- and small enterprises - What do the French bosses expect to do with it ??
May the state hold their hands?
That state that they're accused of imperialism?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couple from you!
Remind me, what created you as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and undermining while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' expenses, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, marching on eggs, dare to demand a reduction in wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What's ironic about how people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I'm from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves in range rather than transform themselves.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But, well, Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral enterprise and from taking part in calls for bids.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all this so that the decision is finally cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that all workers must help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Maybe it's because the management of the Dutch is on good rails while the management of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", who have died from it, I know the pale ones.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start over, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDE.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have merit in getting out of a disease or that one can demerit from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid moral is likely to make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we'd rather go back to the Lord, that's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real shit, you get skinned to the point of just becoming a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, big guys, and if I "beated" like those psychologists say, it totally escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of holding your teeth, suffering the hell and cashing the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist who became a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what you have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be lawful under the MONDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smoke screen to separate a part of a sovereign state that had then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and had been fairly recognized by the Western States that had then ultimately lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office because he did not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as tyrannous (even if we do not like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thanks to us for sharing the results.
A hope therefore but prudence is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from the Earth in the Cygnus constellation which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland..
Method of follow-up.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat.
Thank you Paster of sciences for rewarding us, often, of these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably due to the perception of other elements whose rate is evolving in the event of earthquakes.
Like I told you, for example.
An a priori odourless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we do not have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has often been observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that focused on the sensitivity of animals to Earth's magnetic fields, and especially on their modification before a earthquake.
So I'm not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me!
Or is it about these researches?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we meet in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish turned bizarrely round.
I don't understand that we can think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not hold one.
It just shows how much the rest of the Conservative party is just a piece of shit, right?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been inculcated by the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners have voted for him and he will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the blinking, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have found it difficult to read a few books (there is, of course, a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "ferraille straits" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who stayed there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the battle of Savo) did not want to go back there.
We are actually passed by the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.

Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us review, and show with pride that Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red hat that showed against taxes is pleased to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as nice as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
It's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or before the 70s and 80s and led numerous teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the guardianship of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team member of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he would become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as much as I know he's not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently, it was the flag of the Great Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not what is called the Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country to neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse, knowing that women, men and children are in the interior without doubt?
How??
What a bit troubles me in this "witness", is that the only fact that I could, if only once, rejoice spontaneously at the horrific death of thousands of people, in my eyes, is a witness of a "line approach" personality, all of which "tests" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Perhaps at the short time of "joy," we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We have just thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had succeeded in doing truly and apocalypticly evil to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It would seem that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims grunted by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We doubted it a little bit.
The Western "Christian/White/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the generic misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: bigot conservatism of powers in place and fascising nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That we've understood before, mustn't push the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everybody gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to blow up in the fall.
Not as much to cut the breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your girdle that's a little cliché!
Not everyone.
I rarely fall ill in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about dying, it's just a stage in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, risks of snowfall and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of child increases , it is the amount cashed by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households who have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Graph 2 .
The elimination of half of the above-mentioned widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is fully assessed: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and assumes that it is painless.
And it's not ready to get better.
Well, we're not on the straw for sure, but thinkers.
For once the PS makes a policy rather left we won't cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear far more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let us continue and you will encourage these 20% less work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Lives the Recycled Trots and OICs in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to hide as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the use of money is exceeded, money is no longer used to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth whose part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or even then lower arms and live social minimums, especially if we have social housing.
The utopias of the head cutters at the red Khmer have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the front desk or face the slightest hurdles.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, line up behind you and leave.
From now on, it'll be my first option when I'm traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need a type of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" It's not true.
You just really missed luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was rapid, almost absurdly rapid.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why is this article citing Teman's complaint that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as for travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used bnb air just to reassure me.
I'm planning to pay a deposit and a month's rent at once, but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang Bu$heria over all the tones...
Inoffensive weapons, then.
I am sure this will please families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the style of the author: "Looking for weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is IT ALL the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But it can't be seen since the National Education doesn't have the means to provide an office to the college/high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of telework forced in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, internet connection or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the board at 5:00 a.m. per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to get bullied clauds whose parents spit on you when you're trying to shake?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurdish population can do better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely done everything through.
My first job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
One year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we weren't even asking for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this respect, don't do it if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do.
If I'd stayed in high school jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business work so much, so I hope to end up spending it either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of benevolent threads such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is what we call the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished production manager.
It has been found that the important one was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but the levels were rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate has lasted for years in engineering studies/artistic genres.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy, and art are benevolent threads?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media study or whatever the abscond sector you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the bases of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better for a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I hardly see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise making 80km go-back every day by bicycle to come to work in Paris.
The intra-mural and small belt inhabitants already have many alternative means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
However, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
As much as they benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for a bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When discussing with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they don't pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it's hyper dangerous with all these trucks, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and fuck the survival of the bikes 2/ one takes full pollution in the head For me the bike tracks are to go, it's necessary to reduce the traffic traffic (urban footing type load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), to enforce the code of the road by verbalizing systematically (even the bikes to the bean as soon as it needs to adapt the code of the road written for the bikes 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the fenced passages, not before the truck and scooters do not genuate.
The cycle tracks are apartheid, but the occupation of urban space needs to be rebalanced.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word on the bike spot in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of velocities is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Besides what OR reports, EELV assistants seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, you'd better find someone who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear a complaint being filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air strikes against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be seen as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the light of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with innocent people's lives to ensure that airlines pay for land flying rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurping government / Western Ukraine ultra-nationalists - and who want to demonstrate in large measure that Putin has shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heaven.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this matter go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far the investigators haven't said anything about it.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such an eco-friendly, it's afflicting!
Calling Polaris is losing the north is rejoicing.
A single Benedictine question: is today's poor man poorer than yesterday's poor man?
I can't help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty's book didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I've taken a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term..
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that lowered the concentration of the capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this floor knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is just, we can debate about it without having read the book of which the main thing is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pave summarized by the press false?
I didn't read it and I won't read it.
So I am relying on the summary of his central thesis and that is what seems to me to be pure fumigisteria.
The concept of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Didn't humanity globally enrich itself?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people just start finding their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighbourhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom, but said that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna times" on this site.
You, yourself, are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are schooled and he favours equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
He is, however, an unusual person in Pakistan, since he thinks women are the same as men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14 years of age, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't mention it sufficiently eloquently for you.
It may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her soy character from Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horrors, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The achievement is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronistic Life on Mars de Bowie is simply overturning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last one for me, without the good bof Lange).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all at once to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is that, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mostly the risks of stage shootings and montages that set me up.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the aseptization of today's productions.
I don't think it's easy to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things yet.
No it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series apart from technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I think that the series is in writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
The season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end up like 24 hours of time.
But everyone does what they want!
That's why I say "I will no longer look" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here we go, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - let's cut rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know in spending failed.
Discuss relatively low expenditure positions such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call out of their wishes and throughout this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditures.
"Debt" is an asset held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking one-third of my income (before I even talked about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to make good use of it.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, wind subsidies that are almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem look ridiculous about the most luxurious residences.
Your first $10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking charges and car cartoons, and this is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car cartoons.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are spent.
How can an unemployed person looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not look for it, it means that 80% are looking for it and they cannot find it.
Being myself unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 VCs, it increases my chances.
Actually, I haven't had any news from Pôle Emploi in months, which means the agents are more busy in control operations than actually getting job ads back?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Jobs doesn't provide enough jobs, then you have to move from Pole Jobs.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, and in this case it is ensured that the unemployed fulfil their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title to users of a means of transport, a head of service or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, reduced by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Checks and controls take over now, while Pôle Emploi is in fact close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern employees, they pay the costs.
Non-wage French policies and policies grant rights they have not in fact!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance is involved in the development of wage-earning work.
More than waiting for tweets assassins in Arabic...
In reality, we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then look like the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca from the Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travels.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the smallpox at Mecca during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just common sense but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
Nobody gets out.
Only health workers can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not drastic measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all the necessary precautions."
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us prohibit them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That the message of the first individual and of the second (including religious) group could be passed on and it would have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he will be able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given bonus of humanity, while religion, derived from the brain, has been leading our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the interest of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet in the Church anyway, only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the notion of sin, too "anxiogen"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will make it possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it existed in Christ.
Hillel a century before said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want us to do to you, it's there all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "progressing justice, peace, brotherhood" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset the moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted from force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game comes out soon.
It's not inventing itself.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If this is the PC version you are interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a good 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The rabat-joie of the computer department block all friendly sites.
Hello, is this £30, then 20% discount, or do the £30 include 20% discount?
Beware though: PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's no good.
It's time to buy a new video card *do the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'd erase it from your library if they decided to take it against the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.

So, was France from 1940 a "putrid land"?
Say, this Nobel Prize seems to me like a poisoned gift.
Is it necessary to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in literature, one wonders if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the terrible.
Since I've taken one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing's been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrific computer?
Hello Dantra, still your clothes?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days to rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was burdelic.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorite.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather to play with the girl card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of a beginner I was able to leave with several decent stakes.
I hope that if I get to 95 I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, no offense, I think you're moving a little away from the subject.
This famous all, it forbids the search for jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She's promptly reporting on arms trafficking.
Either you have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or you have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you access to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sensus: all representative authorities, organizations or associations, Muslims or not, having formally condemned the ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who says "constant"?
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubting the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the delisting of French society.
If there is no doubt, so to speak.
Who says the word, but agrees to what?
It consents to closeness with IE or to IE conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to clean the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, "venge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives totally fuck Scotland because they don't have any seats.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the " PROMISE" thinking that he saved his party but did not realize that he signed the death sentence of his Scottish deputies.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking their leader for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Citing the 8% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish Members will no longer be able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it did her well.
Yet he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in general, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least one sterilising effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's as good as the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of the DRMs is not implemented, I remain reading the pirated files, books of the public domain or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without mochard.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am proud of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are likely to be unreasonable.
For example, James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
Harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that do not allow readers to be identified, nor the authors.
But Kobo has all this information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a kindergarten class full of acid schizophrenic children.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it's actually a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or whether it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today's Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to be strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read bearing in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings coming from Iran at the suggestion of Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the horrific lay Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics pushes the world toward the abyss and I would suggest those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
There would be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should I "be"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the slightest chance of still being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like, 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a shattered place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
Oh, that's so crazy.
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but other than that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
How unargued clichés.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a mother carrier.
Lesbian couples may simply be a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero-sterile couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame it is to designate them as future psychologically unbalanced.
One day, they will have the age of defending themselves, saying that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
That is still the case, we have done so...
The important thing about this is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also marketing bodies? !
Anakronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in distant countries grow via internet and Pay Pal than to bend its responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
There is no less that the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands, I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like this and you listen to music - this music today always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has well grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vanquished by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can have an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass vinyls of soul, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at the Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a short article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and get to Wallgate.
By dripping on pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 min walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisoning.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy the colony (in fact, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative rose angry and voiced: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian Representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard ...
That this displeases the Israeli anti-Israeli is an obvious, this is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translated: the global geopolitical relationship ...
And it's always like this since the policy is globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it remains!
You do not answer for the creation of Israel.
What force has the creation of Israel allowed?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyist billevesses written by no other.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter likes her well, which would mean it's a question of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths to which we prefer not to think.
Grow up, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he has posted, he says that to vote once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit democratic commitment to it is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) essentially rule in favor of particular interests, multinational businesses and the rich, At no time he says he simply ignores politics completely because these parties do not govern in our name: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, manifestations, petitions, and try to influence politics from that.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being active politically by presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are gypsy who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is a matter of reason to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were discussing what it actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left out.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The inutility of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years deeply annoys me that my vote does not really count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not yours (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the genre of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "silvesée pseudo-chomskyists".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head seals added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
He draws from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this "fronde" shows that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the history of the RDV where trade historians have become minorities and where exchanges of specialists have been impoverished for the benefit of a loan-to-think condensed type of Sciences Po for press records.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take a guilty man, an scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats that are the key to their thinking.
I think instead that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty party.
This comes from a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the report to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or/or libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for eradication of the state, the first knowing to go to seek the relief of the state for its markets ) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand up.
Who says guilty, said elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
No support from elsewhere.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his god of then, Stalin, the small father of the peoples.
Oulala, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet poses a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, the difficulty of the mechanism of accession in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this horse orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left that do not support the passing of allegiance to their mantras is quite risky.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebelles", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellow" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese guy for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think like white people!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them talking violently anti-White.
My dad's not happy his old daughter's getting out with a white guy.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I was told, the Russians have mainly prejudiced unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very lucky to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' views on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two in my life (one of them abroad), haven't kept bad memories of them, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London have been very kind that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
If you don't remember who you're meeting, everybody's worth it, how do you remember who you were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak Chinese as some sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called Blanc.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the courtrooms are frankly branded right.
When in the Judicial Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders two obstacles to be removed.
The observer's political vision as the judge's factual interpretation.
Then there remains the legally required tool to refocus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecution, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
The claim and lack of knowledge is not an objective analysis.
And so if all of this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The one with the corruption of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such an inheritance.
The area under consideration is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed up to the use of scoffs at the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains good year barely 150 million euros while benefiting from coverage* provided by the quasi-impunity judicial* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where it joins the above-mentioned statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to become dispossessed, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria, then, an elaborate form of lies?
Prices are probably totally prohibitive.
Again, equipment to rob the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these three-cycles all-round, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires bundled, could not.
Like we say, tastes and colors...
Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair's EPlC.
I don't think Whill's inventor ever had to clean up a dog's crotch on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the way, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a pendant for the longboard.
Here there are hills that would please them.
Prices actually seem high, but there really are people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The tricycle of any terrain seems particularly useful to me.
Not all persons with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they became disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know very well that we need.
We can't really say the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair does not happen on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this stuff.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
The world's unique situation, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, as this blockade inflicts a "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Oh, that's not a wooden tongue, rather a concrete and armed lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market that is certain, and it is recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The USA has a well-maintained terrain: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Do not forget also that after having lifted it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've given some thought.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit economy.
Many are only looking for one night's ride on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hopefully) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What does she rent on" ?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" in the United States is not used.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to authorize it to engage in a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be moved, stolen and repelled, cast, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it it would always be near where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...
Where are you going to moor him?
No Marine The Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to deplete!
High finance, speculate, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, therefore our health care structures, with our institutions' debts.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All for the benefit of any hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the minister of the economy a former Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, who alone were responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else to compete with?
You call that how: turn his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "denied" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the enemy's exact strength.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British leathersman in the area.
The sea was hollow at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sundown, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle of the Malouines, where, on the pictures showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in the middle of the day.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two curated cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after having ceased firing, and a race-for-all began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he drew near he saw it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, hanging and severely damaged but still on the move.
After pointing out its projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and it opened the fire, finally running the ship.
Without reliable information, von Ssee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped searching at 2215 hours.
Concerned by reports indicating a British leathersman in the surrounding area, he headed north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, in the dark before the radar was invented, didn't know a ship had flown, so they couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a greater leathersmanship of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they wrestle to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them wrong and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes shall be cast at the UMP to request that an elected final convict be included in the law and thus be permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing electors well on.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA, I PROPOSED FOR AN INCRIPTION TO THE MUR DES CONS DES MAGISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Held by politicians (es) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to love those same ones who will benefit from their irremovability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who really try to move things, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is to the measure of their adequacy.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small billboards" of the funds for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized trade unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theories if right-wing unions, or even extreme right-wing unions, targeted the people on its side and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free of charge.
If, at the moment, the right defrays the judicial news, it simply committed facts about it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not had the treatment of favor.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the left-wing judicial union is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
That a minister supports with such commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote is perhaps minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it is not a secret.
One wonders now whether the "mission" of some judges is not more to go out than to instruct.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to impeach and imprison the whole.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Wassel.
I believe that even the most hungry fool of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directorate fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor to all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact a member of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed for Eurovision, as did so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British TV light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't participate in the contests.
Rare are those who, after one tube, manage to make others.
In any case, most singers/groups can expect at best three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical walk of rock, even though in your dreams you think that all the guitar freaks who smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three deals on a poem primary school level will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us with these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual moustache, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations on a daily basis.
Unless you're imprudently interpreting backwards.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is without a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article whatever it is.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures in the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw the nettles out of the interpretations of not all scientists who last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of the disciplines for a little fun?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for the interpretations given by the other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have so powerful technical and scientific means that the interpreting of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
There is a controversy over the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Les shamanes de la prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this instructive article
Heterosexual men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get on with it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the barrel?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedian on that, however, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, I can suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real journalists, brave, for writing on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Rather than have these puerile ass jokes embroidered.
Not very smart.
Then go away.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the thing that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at you?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...???
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have come out safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., dealer) was entering the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that was known to arrive, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the departure time (television law, advertising, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well seen, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very british FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at rest a chance to beat the English that then...
You're leaving my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's no big deal, I have a little time to find out all your c***.
No, just no.
There's been a lot of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts death commissioners at risk for a distant story of the possibility of a pilot's victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
Noun of size.
In the light of the amateur images, the lack of an image allows the AIF to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner acts a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is deemed too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners is clearly agitated a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark lack of awareness of the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag APRES the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of clerks just downstream of the accident (according to the case, it can be at 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) stirs the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism makes it sell out of the pub.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of having no sex life, the pub and the media are good at selling us things meant to improve our sex life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that you don't really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can continue to control them.
"When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derailing", not "everything".
Given the medical reference, "tosser" is much better said in this context than "derail".
I wonder if all the people who struggle with Ebola could get spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this pseudo-journalism abject beautifully and solidly.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media is talking about most things with this optimism on the other hand.
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and distressed (without coming to hysteria) for the government to get us out of the way when it needs it.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we are to have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of ruling out fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being of this world almost 35 years later.
Also in the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Testimonials that are perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we are not asking psychiatric patients questions when there are reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my mother-in-law explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
What are you looking for, then?
What about ghosts?
Do you put the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimony)?
"Resilience": the word canyon softened by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take for great psychologists after having read D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are lots of empty buzzwords in the psy.
Cyrulnik has taken the lead in "resilience."
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have set us up a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company ??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not *not* a good idea to spring up the air sentinels...
And why is that?
It was a great series, and it looks like the ones who made it happen are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the all-powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the humor of the pipi-caca genus, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a series for kids?
UKIP works for Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in SuperMarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although I'm an adult), but I hope this will give the idea to a chain to spread old people.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we've had an hour's episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second order commercial channels and we can still see it at these times.
And in addition the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 'sad' 60-year-old guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the gliders for several decades have found nothing.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Maybe Argentinian?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which was built the esplanade of the mosques.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, sails in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Mahomet climbed to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan at 2 states, and tasted it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God Recognize His People?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
In order to vanquish tourism in Israel, we are often shown to be half-naked, alanguid youth on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a magnificent piece of propaganda!
It is unfortunate that the photographer from Reuters did not take the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to caillase the Jewish faithful in the background, praying to the Wailing Wall.
@Mat, if this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she conveys that it must be condemned.
This system is untenable and will end up in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone wild, large businesses have benefited a great deal from their employees.
They have been able to convince their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time, and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of laughing and groaning when someone else strikes, support them, show some solidarity, and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not unpunished.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that's kept it.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership on Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by shortening national governments through secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat, and tears"?
This is what makes excellent spillovers, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, there were unions in all the regiments in the 18th century.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave it (in the end, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe himself the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, brief: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if it's more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still lack the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what yet.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm a unionist.
You're being warned, it'll be your fault.
The protection professions with trade unions have already suffered enough, creating a break with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk from an employee.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If not, disaster assured.
And with the ready-made carts, the government welcomes them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He'll be like, "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises".
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on a specific article entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".???
Wait, the section was empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (what a mistake: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a win of the least worst baker; no one has made like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow in front of your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm going to have to worry about that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and encourages us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to break, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not give up, however Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several of the challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the given time.
There's also the cancer that's guarding, with solar blows.
It is decided that everything succeeds us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of solar residual wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the ozone in the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest to allow us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogen UVC and lets the UVA and most UVB pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a resident when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was understood in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a habitator of melanoma, UVs only make AGREE its development.
They don't.
For proof: not all tanners don't necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a toubib tells you that you have to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it's better not to listen because UVs are necessary for every human.
The excess, on the other hand, is just like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly induces melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant, and it has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as the frontline communication material.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those who are interested in it have determined that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied to it
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I've decided to count them.
This is the fourth plea in the plea I read in today's comments.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can hardly see how it could go back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................................
It is most likely that this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrials' We put forward super u but all the stores and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650€ (average wage in French)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear it.
For my part, the power is one.
Go without grudge, I kiss you
It is called bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-raison break-up.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffle, joining in this the left-caviar, of which they sometimes come out, for example by condemning the releases of CO2 while spending their vacations in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and truffle, so don't be surprised to often meet criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not that complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well, you're in a position to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the short-term environmental issues.
The Boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the economies because it is the one that infects the media.
There's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front of them.
She's so badly made that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply don't have any legitimacy to make a comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and still seems obsessed by the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic abilities.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're only looking for this, a camera will do the thing.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
(honesty forces France to say that its workforce is decreasing, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more dramatically, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, when we see weaknesses, shortcomings in our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegia is certain.
That all those who have gathered little or no military thing dare come here to say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
If the same potion is applied to the entire public service and public finances, it will be a little better.
And for Josi: really great: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why La Défense can be a little busy!
Well, yeah, the savings that everyone agrees on is that we have to do it, you have to see it somewhere, don't you?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it happens at home, poor dears.
I'd have to do that, but I don't have to do that, because in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
Why close the Val de Grace will weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local communities, history is repeated at each post closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not welcome the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most annoying thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's the depressing thing to turn his Facebook thread around and see that 80% of his friends started their status by the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
It will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus going to work and realizes only where his skirt has come back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely fucked up.
Not really, I think the author takes the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her coming back on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
You don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie really has just shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I don't know.
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really bad.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows positive developments in democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we confiscate the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take care of things.
Together with the commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Translate: Winds and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the con-tributable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity from renewable sources to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity from the wind or PV renewable is already more GHGs on the other steps and especially gas, or worse coal than in Germany, to compensate for the interference.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I didn't say is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and how all the right-wing people tear down the interlocutor I never do.
I would also mention the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a cost-effective and inefficient way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the vapour of greenhouse gas water of less effect than the Co2 it is true to recall the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part in the steam of water and a little in the water of rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most of the Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had described India as a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafias.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletic imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "noise neighbours"...
The low cost pitch is paid cash.
Too bad for such a great project.
For the incident, the possible design failure occurs only with a helium that is too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but implementation...
contrary to arianspace which is a private society, it seems well that soyoz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They might pay for the frigate satellites they know.
This is all the more annoying as many media outlets take over the only titles - and many readers hold only those titles.
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Quite in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is only a launching problem.
