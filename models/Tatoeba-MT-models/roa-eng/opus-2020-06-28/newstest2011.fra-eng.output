What's going to happen? CSSD doesn't know about Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected mayors in the capital will apparently have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
Newspaper.cz "tested" the new members of the CSSD municipal council, whether they know the argot that was born in the city hall in recent years, when it was the partners of the current coalition who headed in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the new elected do not understand very well the known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in the pragmatist politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elite to the culture to the test of the vocabulary of the "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elite Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of a golf course.
"It's the only expression that you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the harpooneer.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year prior to the pre-eectoral congress of the SDO, the drafting has chosen 6 examples, priority being those related to the Mayorship of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "boeuf nerf", "treason of the capital" and "college".
Three of the elected members agreed on the quiz, the four-year-old Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has categorically refused the test.
"I am not taking care of these things at all here and how the representatives of civil democracy are amused: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently working on how we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elus Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of the Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to 'Kaucky' and the only expression he became in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says immediately, "but I know about the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay me a language course," he jokes.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elut for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the pastry."
"I think it's about going to a business," Plachy is willing to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of argot in social democracy.
"I've taken advice with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have something like this."
"We say the names sometimes are sometimes used abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the socio-democratic party, who the members of the party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
Elu Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Little old, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scammers during the party sponsoring, is called "the little game".
The nicknames are also the only ones allowed to use the social democrats within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Pragois president.
"Docteur en droit de matraque" he recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as doctor en droit JUDr at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of the "sisters", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared to be witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and do not have a child.
The one who becomes "sister" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"You don't judge young women in good health either because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit witch hunt.
There's a "hic" in the case.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard warned about the drawback of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and one man and then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
The BBC server sent this information.
Criminals say it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual anointings is inflamed with the contact of the woman.
The oil fell, it seems, when the team wanted to "buke the bad spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "sources" is approved by persons of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunt, the Gambia did not later than last year saw the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have strove by black magic to kill the President as well."
"A close call from Guinea to the rescue, led to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, of men and women randomly chosen in the villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International.
At the farm, imprisoned people were to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure it is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The poets warm up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out by the door of the RPG Byty customer centre of the "coal bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He had a case under his arm with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is trying to serve a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works with solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power of signature.
"But I signed it anyway," he explained to me in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOK.cz apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by rubbing the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 a.m.
Right next door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already beginning to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrive to learn about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to affect people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance and other events.
In the Ostrava area, people from over 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio collect mail with new lease contracts in their letter box since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special shop for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It has been working for almost a week, so it's still on the test" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and former minor apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats made it quite sustained before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a well of board in the toilets, solace the man mentioned in introduction.
However, most of all, according to employees, pensioners come to make sure that they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign as the RPG promised in a special offer.
This is a half of the rent that the other tenants will receive before 15 December that will have signed their new contract.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by the questions.
"As for the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee says at the counter.
And yet RPG places both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on rent, it is an independent court that will take the decision.
'It is not about threats, but only about the unique and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"Here no one goes to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man on the street in front of the client centre gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 retired crowns and I have 5000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the RPG Byty's residential portfolio, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years of 2011 to 2014 this is expected to do 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling in front of the armchairs refurbished from the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments that is more than 90 percent of the apartments of RPG'.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns the m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really low amount 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (cf. the graffiti) is made to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on rent increase have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of offices including architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new seat of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - walls of colors, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural project society Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-school nursery enterprise since the first drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of children, and it was important for women architects and project leaders to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, the kindergarten school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a work taken with care for children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten school and with the support of management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme for human resources and the Czech Republic's State budget.
Thanks to funding (at 2.8 thousand Czech crowns) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the two-year funding allocation, Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating that helped to make the staffing request.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of children throughout the day.Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they have more than three years for the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there is more to replace.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the mini-school programme is comparable to that for pre-school education.
The children do not only play but also a quality education is assured - from the beginning to the preparation of the school benches they teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go to a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname Maison en os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade recalling scales and everywhere present in the curves, here is everything that is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees geometry, rhythm and order thought precisely.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The winding and torsion of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in wave the window frames, the railings, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelets and the blades.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district on the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy contractor, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepts Gaudi's idea of an unusual reconstruction and a better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade have also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work for Casa Battlo's plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises named the house hot just after its finish because of its organic forms "the House in Bones".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with air vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi did not comply with the construction directives at that time and did not allow it to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded changes.
For example, he did not like the members of the municipal council that the building pillars impede on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo demanded (and got satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third there was a private room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by basic elements of reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern concept of space binding.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high company can communicate comfortably or either limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a non-traditional toîture and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the interior courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-coloured game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued to visit because they found that it was a lucrative enterprise and expanded the scope of the visits to common areas and the attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 percent discount.
The sum is however above the price of entry into the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a napkin: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bedding, so the mattress and the top give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course they must complement harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are crucial: weight, size, age, health status and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which we're going to place the mattress and the top is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continually sleeping are not suitable because they "heat" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. The mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hockey players who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their weary shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a sticky layer of lazy foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misused "the information" of the joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in stuffed furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy moss conquered hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy moss.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't go back in the night like after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
It also works as a protection against squars.
For choosing the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or all 180 cm.
For single-seater beds, for example, singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should put your hands in a comfortable way with slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who have been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own top and mattress, so be careful however during the suit of choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise it will only remain to climb the summit to different heights and this is not feasible on all frames of bed.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which the shape and ventilation layer should be at least three centimetres.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress, you must not feel the springs," says Hélena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of sink.
The sofa bed, when the mattress and the sommier are united as sissy sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is usually done today.
And since during the night you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and stuffed) sieve.
For this reason the specialists refuse to make a claim over a life of 25 years for a mattress or a life guarantee.
But all of it to him.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, quit, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to manufacture coatings with sliding closure for the whole, that is to say, after the opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) or handling for large models (and for one person only) becomes when you take them out a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a sleeper?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if any) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of such a bed.
For single-position blade tops with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the blades can also be installed what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special bond of the lamellas that allows to put pressure or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeping "sins" well.
For men who have "swords as wide as the back", this is really an important thing.
This is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a soft area at shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer a softer hip surface.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or platelet tops with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and infers the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and top, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its ends must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the top or the area rampows in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw and grass-based ones.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to bio mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop fragrances of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting it from boulder plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (she has more pores with a more breathable cellular structure than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached its first place.
Saving for the mattress and the sink is not simple.
It is possible from time to time to have two mattresses for the price of only one special stock on the part of manufacturers or producers.
As for example the company Magniflex that offers Duofreez mattresses with memory foam Memory sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second one for free.
The age of hairy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempure material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing huge load factors starting up.
The Tempure springs to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against the bad sleep and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that lift the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to follow people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child brings more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, originally set up to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as exemplifies that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the little Anicka has stirred up a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that this is not a spy but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracers in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear something of this kind, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control.'
"Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
She confesses, however, that such devices can help in an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and individuals, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on a regular basis after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains nevertheless."
'Cheapest devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in an elongated position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, the so-called intelligent mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologiciel.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to those used in the pendant of the size of a box of matches or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used as an autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could turn the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the length of life of the strings is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating strings from the anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the collapse of a huge amount of detonating strings at MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army's pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even the generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should each year have an exercise in explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating strings.
At this distance there are 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army reserves could be there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating strings, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has provided - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their fists and that the shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body laundry we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head off if they buy us so much detonating strings."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to contain," says commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of km of detonating ropes will be held by the army for these "munitions" for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reported only four years of life of the detonating strings and pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can go even up to four years," says a two who does not want his name to be published in view of the army's criticism.
The length of time spent, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other department argument is a discount due to the amount for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says the spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the defence department buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating strings of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always command only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and in order to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and reliable detonating strings.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak strong army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years is the Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of detonating old ropes that it buys today "at a cheap price".
So far, I take advantage of contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the best individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of the best individual entrepreneur competition for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia he lacked a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
His savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a graduate student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building he transforms into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four star Pytloun hotel design.
This year he received another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrava U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other franchise candidates from the Pytloun hotels manifested themselves," the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the licence for the start-up of a large-scale hotel, victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served well," added Pytloun.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain business relations regularly.
In his view, success-related reputation also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has in general been recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was steeply replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the meaning of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the award in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crowns turnover firm.
'I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me and my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight competition,' says the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the story of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's environment for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe after 18 years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers really started to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not passed in Farmet alone in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchase of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped from this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even licensor," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained beneficial results even though they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they remained uncompromisingly investing in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leaves us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is also rising with and the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes foolish regulations.
The year's Absurdity Investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year's survey of the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to provide documents to offices that officials can obtain online.
More than one third of the 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs authorities requested a paper excerpt from the trade register while the grievor can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Authority will no longer request the extract from the Trade Register for the control of payments of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To point out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If 3,000 voters showed up last year, at least 4000 voted this year.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and, more and more.
"We may be a number of documents to fill out for tax returns in the first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship becomes a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place on the conditions for the company, 8th place more than last year.
The competition for the Absurdity of the Year was established for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can report any year on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April to the end of September, the last deadline before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and at www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the greatest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last year's investigation, it's a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees there is, for example, the obligation that the maintenance vehicles of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that the entrepreneurs with twenty employees, recapture two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition site.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on the Place Wenceslas in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public personalities regularly participate.
For example, this year Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts stakes in the legs of the entrepreneurs, and for this my aim is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company', said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd cracks is not a sword stroke in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office for the individual company to the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most plebiscite obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was abolished with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the contest.
The 2009 Absurdity was the downfall for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was abolished.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Firm Responsible.
The adjective of this competition is the support to the reasonable and fair enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and carry out a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the year's rebel.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm competition, organized by Vodaphone, registered companies that did not succeed with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different, their support and forecasting activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists throughout the Czech Republic there is no example of the Pragois Prological Society and Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a responsible firm in the Pardubice region is the Isolite-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for the past 17 years that sponsors children with disabilities.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 percent, has been awarded the title of the Central Bohemian Region Responsible firm, third in the region in the support of Vodaphone's Firm of the Year.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing relaxed and even reduced working hours up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, in proportion, reduced wages.
The jury also awarded the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports ditoyen activity in nearby surroundings, and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow who helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very latest, also for its activities, there is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch building company, winner of the Moravie-Silesia region.
They were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the attached part questionnaire of the document for registration and had sent it to the organizer before August 15.
The replies that were poorly completed or incomplete in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company Responsible but were not disqualified from the "main" competition the firm of the year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and trading in Lubos real estate. G.
It had endeavoured to handle precisely a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition." Pravo said the head of the Plzen Antonie Zelena Prosecutor's Office, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
After 24 hours, police officers released this 46-year-old contractor.
To know how it could affect a public competition, it can only be speculated about such little official information.
In a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace and in the course of the public competition.
"He acted as a client and in no case as an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is put in place when there are several legal beneficiaries.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their restorative rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the purchasers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesman for the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information regarding the persons who had registered on the appeal and, as he himself is, also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed that the field candidates not participate in the competition.
And he probably had the chance to retire.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interrogation.
Lubos G. had extensive contacts above the FdT (Land Fund) standards.
He was in the case of the former Chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the city hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it could put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to pull from their purse from January up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas is almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be closer for households in the apartment to the 100 crowns annually more than currently.
However, all suppliers decreased electricity prices due to the sensitive development of renewable energy production, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
So we can also count an additional hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from city to city.
They are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, families in Liberia will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases its infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the pestilences will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns nearly 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children are savoury with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer trendy and operates smoothly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring to the doctor's hands those who drink, who are not yet fifteen years old.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashion because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle to dad in the closet, it's sometimes about wisky, but it's the fernet and vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus do not feel it," the department chief explains.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It is now alcohol in fashion especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he acted as slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of Pélikan department, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working at Horovice since last year, he was at Motol, where he exercised ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolgirls from the wide environs completely drunk.
"A girl was hospitalized like this four times
"She began her career at 12 years when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was in the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is 48 hours away," said the head of the department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their overall tolerance to the fact that their rejections are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the alcoholic word there is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that are not found in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a socio-family background that is significantly unfavorable," explained the Chief of Department Pelikan.
According to the Spokesman Jurinova, about forty ivre children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic at Motol.
They are integrated into the statistics only with a large intoxication that requires hospitalization.
Children who are drunk who are after emergency care brought home by parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exhibits three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Whether they drink in spite of the bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I lived in the day of witches an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the day after the "wood mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients needed by the body.
"They are better for this because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They're just surprised at where they are," he adds, knowing that from time to time it's spoiling the good mood of patients with at least the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care hospitalisation can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to pay back a single evening," added Pélikan.
However, in his view, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover care-related burdens from parents, do not deal with cases of children who are drunk.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence has switched from Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is based.
This is the first time this type of aircraft has become owned by someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad for exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of L-159.
They are currently stationing at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for exchange have been taken on long-stocked aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence'.
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," Pravo Pejsek said.
He enjoyed that the army would not remain without a biplace since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 monoplaces unused into two biplaces.
The army took over the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train the pilots of NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account to determine how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender and contacted EADS directly.
Defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft at Aero Vodochody and uses only 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
The European Commission has, however, lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice as aircraft should have been selected in a European and in no way by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
A longer index than annular is a sign of a low risk of cancer
Men who have longer index than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer magazine.
This may depend on the level of the hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before 60," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should undergo prostate cancer testing, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time close to three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right-hand index shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those with longer indexes than the annular, however, the risk decreased to 33 per cent, for men over 60 years, the risk decreased to 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone matches a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Pprofessor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
Czechy as most of Europe is covered by snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, most of the time there was compact snow, the blazers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague is the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91th kilometre one truck was injured, at the 93rd two heavy trucks crashed, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on Highway D1 at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit each other.
Drivers should exit right after Brno at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter 182 km to Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometres was formed in this place.
Also on Highway D11, there is an accident and, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created in Prosek, where Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Tramways are delayed, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Paz (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the crisis staff of Prague has yet to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of snow 7 fast links.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. in the night until 5:00 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling, but are resustaining.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road to Brno there are beginning to be by places of snow gusts and on the road to Blansko the chains are required to pass certain communications tracks in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Sarace-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowflies and strawberries.
We can't estimate it right now when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin prudence is rigour in the white Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the aspersion of inert products, there is still a five-centimeter layer of warning snow CTK.
In Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimetres of snow; it fell most in Northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravie-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
The blackout gradually went away in Chechnya.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army has sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, only known as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise gun.
Its projectiles are driven by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly crushing explosive, actually works as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
Nor is it protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can put it out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that it finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a specific target point, according to which it corrects its target site and relies on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've reached 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located at Place Mareinbader's office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next July, the work place of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs that are still scattered in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. Moreover, the open-air offices of Astro Park are better suited to the employees' working mode.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a primordial location with remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a large company within the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of the economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," Mr. Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in dealing with the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa station.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the City Hotel. It raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that once served as part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company of notation and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specialty Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. One year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered to be the third largest provider of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The Branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the building Astro Park.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats to Mr. Assange
Wikileaks are experiencing increasingly difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, apparently stays in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom" said on Wednesday (local time) cyber activists who caused revelations through the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee on Territorial Protection had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper "The Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier with regard to Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and without scruples, thereby endangering our national security and endangering life all over the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson manifestly reacted to statements made in North America.
In America, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisor said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the U.S. President, Mr. Barack Obama, called the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton as "ridiculous and absurd" if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently released, to engage in spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a statement by the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for the fight against leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which all administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted to visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is, in German the slightly demodified ice confectioner, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes of it in the waffle and then begins to sell it.
To find out, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani firm.
The ice cream maker founded the University of Ice in 2003 to ensure that ice creams released from its machines respond everywhere to high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted to visitors from all over the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and spread over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in private ice cream.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk to realize their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose in the future a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and she wants, after a few years, to get some of the singular things out of this work that she's trying for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats all at 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it produces a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately questioned: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against letting himself be misled by the spirit of time.
The one who only speaks of ice "made from natural ingredients", perhaps despite this use of stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is of course possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will buy nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the basic mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"suppliers will all try to rewire dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Be it in fruit sorbet recipes with fresh sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass that, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, is the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavours or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use puree peach with a lot of sugar, you have to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
Ice making no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice available to make it unctuous and brought back to negative temperatures simultaneously.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo shaves of fruit purée from his head to his feet and thus crushes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an " incident like this may occur during each course: this is only a matter of time."
Comptrollers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has taken root in the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Head of Testbiotech, on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the Chairman of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively to develop Efsa's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group in a text-based manner and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in substance, would be controlled by the authorities located in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A senior manager of the Efsa has recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta without a conditional or transitional period. In doing so, she has changed her camp.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which awakened the suspicions of both the German Federal Environmental Agency and Members of the European Parliament.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute.
This body considers itself a neutral forum of experts who belong, among other things, to science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified corn on the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If we don't seek the risks, how can we find them?" Mr. Then asks himself about an accuser.
This is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are barely yet researchers who are not related to societies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck states that "the industry controls safety research."
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell sought out, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube behind her back.
There was a manoeuvring.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and began to tear down a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration resulted in the construction work being stopped.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender paving and coarser poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
A few pieces of it came up.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap, simple and earthly rock."
He claimed that by cutting it in the saw, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of the Stones of Stuttgart lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were defeated or disappeared in the dump," he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reports that he was the subject of insults and threats when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the stone parallelpiped weighing on average 80 kilos, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to make it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loadings from a truck.
About half is still stuck in the forest, with the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These scandalous stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or the limitations of the flocks of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"wasn't this political component."
He enters his car all the way, turns from his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did some law studies that he abandoned, and later began to study biology before he later became interested in computer science and eventually became a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He loved his treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims he is the biggest merchant of ancient stones.
He's talking about it.
Stones of sand carved with art are laid on the snow.
"Sometimes they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, warm yellow, says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that goes through the forest.
It shows a tuss of the finger: Red sand stone, formerly, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Joli travertian."
The parallelpiped was already part of the tribune at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from Saint Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved by simple levers and carts drawn by oxen, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put into play."
He didn't get rich, even less rich.
Today, however, this carrier employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Next thing you know, he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Skills to Conquer High Potentials
The counter has a strong influx.
16 students scramble to buy small loaves of salmon, tomato sauce and whites-eats.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in mechanical design and engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of idea contest, they need to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to the competition to detect better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in amphitheatres before they arrive in the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, they try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to loyalize them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group loves talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards featuring the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group's enclosure.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can meet the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," Selle says.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In goods in the sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by sorting out a kyrielle of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, court the highly skilled workforce.
They are mostly graduates from engineering lines who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecast, the gap in engineering positions will grow further.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting and advisory expertise.
It organizes costly events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally-paper where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to seek high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in contact with all those who took part in similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct softening on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing quite classically by participating in the professional fairs where they are engaged in brain hunting.
"We're trying to reach the graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem of succession.
At present, 35 posts are put to the competition on the company's site.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant posts."
"This costs dear and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with different institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or write his or her end-of-study project at home."
Honorable advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Sometimes, a large group cannot do this," said Stübe, chief of staff.
Money has long been a major factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or promotional opportunities are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual table of honour for German employers.
To this end, he asked the employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image with job seekers.
"I think that candidates rely mainly on external assessments for a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own collaborators," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no further oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, South-Eastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has issued a ban on an equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelling its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, further drilling is now prohibited.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that is the cause of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this incident, which cost 11 employees their lives and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to allow further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, supporters of this solution want to reduce the United States' dependence on foreign countries on oil supplies.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multiple billions of claims for compensation, is at the heart of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling gel decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited following numerous charges of corruption, is currently undergoing far-reaching reforms.
At the same time, Mr.Obama announced that they would be eliminated by the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector now publicly warn against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," as a result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm, prior to Wednesday's ban on drilling.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country Ogoni is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is brown oiled; it smells like that which exists in the petrol station: Because of a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't run out," the environmental activist says to journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man sinking into the muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat trail around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil carpets.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she once collected shrimps from whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters are completely out of control.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil has wailed from an oil pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town near Bodo now have to go back for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the pests jumps into the eye when you walk through the mangrove marshes crossed by streams of water.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat makes a brown water crading. Anyone who puts his hand on it removes all oil cover.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the soil as lizard sticks. Isolated palm trees sadly let their palm trees hang.
We look in vain for bird clouds, as we usually find them in wetlands: As soon as the engine stops off, a fantastic silence falls on this paradise of old which resembles a service station by the smell it defuses.
"What is happening here is war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is done.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battleground besieged for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Again today, the return to Ogoni country is forbidden to this society: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni country are not exploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters rise in the water of steel rattles like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees" are called very affectionately the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them run by corrosion until the landmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this kind breaks down from time to time in pieces, as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that which passed into the sea during the accident of the super-petroleum "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner objected to the Shell group's application to Nigeria of essentially less stringent safety standards than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of driving failures is "still much higher than allures".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: They are completely bare and covered with cambouis up to the neck.
A sparklight under one of the many barrels that sometimes connect to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
We've been heating crude oil in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters into a container by passing through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop and finally the diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre Diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low 40 centimetres of Euro per litre of Diesel: for they acquire their raw materials free of charge.
this is offered by the "protectors" that put the oil pipeline network in perch throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a completely insignificant small part of the temporary storage of the raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and soldiers, are responsible for the lion's share in tanks and are bragging it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether environmental disaster should be attributed or subversive activities to the population or to the mode of laxist production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no illegal robbery and refineries."
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only about the group's withdrawal. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will become better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to get out of the way" announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers may appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even the soldiers mostly from the north of the country intend to enjoy as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"At all points of view, this crazy thing has caused our country to fall down well," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, investigators have discovered a possible lack of construction that can lead to "disaster failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
Early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company had been visibly more fortunate: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 devices presented a serious safety problem and warned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could result in serious consequences: It can cause fatigue crests and leakages in connection with the oil pipeline, indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "disaster failure of reactors".
Rolls-Royce and 20 A380 series aircraft are involved.
The airline Quantas's Airbus, which was due to land on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
Quantas Director Alan Joyce stated that his company would claim damages in respect of the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be conducted on superjumbos that are also equipped with the relevant reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesperson for the ASTB, Mr.Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the Quantas airline had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 for one week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, by a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest line plane in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
All covered in white Germany: In one night, snow fell over almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
In the winter, Germany is grated: Nearly all the republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover is 15 centimetres per place.
The traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service personnel worked on a permanent basis, but they could not come to the end of the snow that continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects these tidal rays to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
The snow masons on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather alert Meteomedia announced the level of violent alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxon-Anhalt land, the police announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On Highway A2, snow and wind have led to an interruption of traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls affected highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees fallen on the railways, catenaries or the destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich must have stopped travelling.
Fire extinguishers and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall has resulted in many cancellations of flights at Germany's main airports.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
Fraport spokeswoman indicated that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
Winter service provides permanent service.
It is true that the passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car toured on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will whirl in the event of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified the group's headquarters: Twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for an acquirer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoted a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we will check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings or sell them ourselves, and put them back in later rental."
This is how Germany's largest financial institution has already relinquished its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the binoculars for an amount of Euro 272 million from the own funds holders, and had then rehabilitated them.
Energy optimization transformations have, according to some indications, engulfed some EUR 200 million.
A sale would, of course, bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the Spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had thought about the juveniles who were reported dead following several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to climb the bodies because the security situation of the disaster well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near Greymouth City.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance of surviving.
So far the bodies couldn't be rebounded.
Today, parents and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 juveniles, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also in their place.
The flags were laid in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the New Zealand commemorative party that New Zealand hoped that minors would come to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he cannot resign himself to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried at the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are displaced, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
To which audience has the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn been able to think well by turning "Walhalla Rising" ?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) who has only one eye is made a prisoner; he gets rid of his trunk and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents from one another. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is of bad mood, he plucks the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be killed.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the jar says nothing about its real name. Even the other characters let, at most, escape to the hindrance of one or two sentences a few cries of horrific agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and you feast on the mountain landscape that is incredibly beautiful in Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film targets several target groups, it is unfortunate that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy concerning the Faro-like drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and in the intestines.
The fans of action films die of trouble, when the ship embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by calm and mischief before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has found no film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of the misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a juicy soundtrack, but especially with an insatiable hatred that wails from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who is loyal to the side of the village, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything else, the bourgeois hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into warrior, may be sending the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rotting.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which has as its aim the attachment, enthusiasm and astonishment.
Traumatic experience.
Mysterious terracotta work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take a position on this subject, even less subject itself to the Agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, towards midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrates; the largest town located nearby is 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in IAEA documents, as it is about the reactor that Syria has built, it appears with the help of North Korea in parallel with stone, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at that time, and even, with time the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little indexes showing this country developed "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more careful about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "pleasible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
Asked how he made sure he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in summer, claiming that the IAEA had "documents enough to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hurriedly removed the debris from the "unused military building" and made a methodical smoothing of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received, thanks to a Member State, satellite images of commercial vendors showing the time it directly followed the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish its authenticity objectively.
Syria has always made sure that it has never completed a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus submits that uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA refuted this argument after the analysis of the particles by calling it impresponsible.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of El-Kibar and refuses access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said, "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation of this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without a result being achieved and "it is becoming increasingly a serious issue of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, and ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear arms prohibition treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
Up to now, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities this is, what their function is or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly beside a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors from all three sites.
In Vienna, it is stated that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is an intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelpipe to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one facility could "serve fuel production".
There would be "no indication of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to the unenriched uranium.
However, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental issues: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium required for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the engravings, which could hide traces of great value, have been stored in all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information on the location of storage of the ties.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had in 1998 examined the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it can be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In recent analysis of photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Photographs taken by satellite, however, show that Syria has engaged in terrasion work in the three suspected sites and displaced huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to dispel suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months preparing a plan for inspections to be carried out, which would enable Syria to maintain possible military secrets. Only time spent shows how much interest the inspectors have in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus also undermined this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States, who has been referring for a few months to what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already mentioned "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority of the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalating.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to: "It would serve, if at the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing is known about this story, but that is enough to provoke illness.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian boar during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some planned shooting sequences in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There were no love stories in concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization has subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissionerate withdraw the quality of a goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
After a few hesitations, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted permission for shooting in Sarajevo, but there is no reason why it did not come in spite of this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she has learned of the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all parties taking the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This is a big difference, however, with the version "a rape victim is in love with his boar".
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie expresses herself, is "unfair and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, it's all going well again with the Irish.
no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overdoes visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy at the background of strong music, they tripping feet.
Cork's Bailey-Pub in ireland from the south vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis bullets at a distance of three meters in beer beers from the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "bière-pong". The winner impoches 500 Euros plus an airplane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world championship of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle game to drink and the computer scientist reserved, these two behaviors don't really go well together.
Yet, despite this, the young 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the question of terror, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I find a strange feeling," he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she has found her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark outlook in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are achieved, it will be an emigration stream comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed a great deal of ease, grief now takes the whole place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects well-trained young Irish people who have experienced only moments of happiness so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under thirty years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times published extensively the letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
The student in Leanne Caulfield law, president of the Irish student union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eyes and offers no future prospects to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have a strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cramped from one practical internship not paid to another.
She states that they are her biggest concern is to emigrate herself within four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the exhibition "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme "work abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a burden, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector.
A fashion house is just out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hanover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can finish paying back the credit he contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live practically no more."
He bursts out of a embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive large-brand cars are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, funded 100 percent by credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything go down because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, he feels hot tea and says, "I don't have children to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"Person must not suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what has ever been experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad, that's not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life simply continued."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is going on elsewhere.
In his palm trees, he already has a few years of work in London. That’s why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns him well these last days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not much emotion," he said by drinking a long handful of beer.
"A farewell, it still seems disturbing."
"Let's call this a good-bye, relaxed evening, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, just like in private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific in South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after having suffered a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents to Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, thus reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way in which democracy in their country worked in practice, the same figure as last year but with a strong 25% increase in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but rising sharply from 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook up support for democracy.
While this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again decreased this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It was only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they themselves or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act over the past year; however, this figure is decreasing compared to 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela's respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28th.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country affected and plunged into fear.
Polling boxes and a new vote, ballots scattered in the gutter, polling stations sacked and intimidation were presented.
The polling stations were opening late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering in the vicinity to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event "a rather good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that they “did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process”.
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their original call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic that rages, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In any case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from voting because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, it's clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rate by more than 50 per cent, and this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term during an election next year might depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, visibly mourning, that she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has subsided in the disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and where others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President with even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage claims of trade unions are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation erodes the momentum for growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the obligors who had denied a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its dues in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be editing towardss an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always stressed that this could not involve supervision by the IMF, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which is similar to a prelude to the consolidation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which kirchnerism is very popular.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her returned.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband's policies.
Half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a sort of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors appeared on November 27, 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for sentiments about the continent, having established innovative business links, including a partial free trade agreement, in the greatest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My test was successful, but just enough.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including taping country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum clothes.
An attempt at mandatory mysterious murder was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, merely through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking that the question of the continental part itself was missing.
Instead, the candidates enjoyed plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from attracting anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to sneeze Taiwan back into the cradle.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocative for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has come under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is working to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai was welcomed as a candidate of the DPP for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr.Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty in choosing from potential candidates.
The KMT needs to introspect itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite a staggering economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson said that his cabinet and his local antennas would be refurbished.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Appointments to Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
At the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handpicked by President Obama to take place at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a large appointment in the category of the "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious but is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before the recording; this "establishes the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skillful hand of pop and funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line in Spalding in relation to the lightning success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Apart from this, the Grammy Awards electors have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the "instrumental album" category, a twist on an invigorating frizz of a record that was one of the first favourites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Postootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by the hoarse voice of New Orleans and frequently invited to HBO's "Treme" was honored in the contemporary jazz category; he is also heavily inclined to a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the great category together; in competition with Billy Children Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards Appointment: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
Classic appointments for the 53rd Grammy Awards each year include a mix of landscaped musicians and composers from all over the world.
At the top of the nominations, we quote Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
Classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classical producer of the year showcases five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "God Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho du Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatto Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt Symphony No. 4 was first performed at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he soon wrote the work for 15 minutes especially for the performer at the Avital mandolin, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the category of orchestral services, for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a Stravinsky record of works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist- soloist appointments; here are: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, Soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project was approved by the planning committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
The criticism of the project claimed that it promoted terrorism as well as traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice takes her."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing for or against the center, at speaking time approximately equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There's no more America," wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also been protesting in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 were carried out in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of the order of 135 co-existed families in Riverside County for years but it wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square feet mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles east of the Chaparral lycée.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"She can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That is why she is very special, even though she is far from being a truly "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online Thursday edition of the Science newspaper.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in researching life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Global and Space Scientific Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is quite different so that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in some ways, rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar said.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that a life-form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said, so researchers assumed that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs of stolen exposure were found in Compton
The other two dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced Thursday.
The four exposed dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, said to Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are good," Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and in what circumstances they were discovered.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a pet shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, had gone missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they expected to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in other competitions scheduled in the days prior to the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said in the Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their bedroom.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They've opened the windows a little bit so the dogs can get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van flying at 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a award was given on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM waits no more than the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start zero again.
A federal judge of New York Bankruptcy officially rented the "prepackaged" plan on Thursday by creditors that approximately $5 billion in debt would be wiped out; opening the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With the decision of Thursday, that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to float under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the directors general of what will be an alleged studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 from the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility to fund new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank itself at $75 million and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was initiated to advise management on how to place its finances, as it did not have the means to pay interest to $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, among whom none of them was willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper are awarded multi-million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a "success premium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "Le Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a big break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic pearls, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button toy's rising, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are teddy toys of the size of an Indian pig who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy more, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locks.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a ride into a session with a self-correction and a van classification.
If you are distrusting when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No versions are compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and is equipped with an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by putting the blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roulette skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last button cell micro-robots.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin was hanging a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, quietly issuing orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - responsible for public order in China, who were afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Keep up!"
"Be thugs!"
Show them, he says, "What do the pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who barely passed their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, were guarding themselves.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly perched at the top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The Guangdong province has exchanged grey-green uniforms against a more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had encircled a uncontrollable snack cart by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur rebuffed his business and part.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their galley and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty attracting attention to this underground underground underground China brigade
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Inspectors of the province of Hubei defeated an observer after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for police inspectors in Beijing, outlawed and posted, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violence-impregnated video game, available online for download, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the assault of street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after a controversial round of tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real full cleaning."
Sceptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, 18 to 22 years old, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five traits of the face in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size, 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
The 26-year-old pension is compulsory.
The officers stated that work was too physically painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; this is the size, weight, features of the face, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The Chengguan women are like flower pots, he said, adding, "In addition to being pots, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the demand for the order of the face traits.
That means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or with disabilities should not apply.
"We can't let a person box or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pommed cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the development of her appearance as sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a sloppy air.
Xu Yang, a colleague of 21-year-old dimples, said, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they fed greater career ambitions than simply hunted down vendors in the alleys where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much as possible of small breads or tofu bowls before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu when a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily leaving his bike-carrette in noodles.
Agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than hard.
"It's about the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposure of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were hit or burned.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two pastes of houses in the Placid place Baoguang, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted at the scandal.
An iron arm of 15 minutes followed before the policemen, in the face of the disaster, broke a elbow-off path towards their vehicle and left at full speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male team coordinator, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, male co-ordinators aged 40 or over play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li Said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the audience begins."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant of a former campaign and his efforts to get lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the honourable senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 presidential office until the scandal around his case made the big national titles last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator may still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Counsel for Mr. Ensign stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to hold any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, stating that there would be significant evidence to suggest that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first communicated in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the honourable senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called ban on the rotating lobbying door.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the minister's judge refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks in its section of public integrity, including last year's decision to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of mistrial.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Ensign, stated in an interview that on Monday he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department did not seek charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the honourable senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I am not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's parents' payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the honourable senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "marteled" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Alligant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After holding a low profile for several months, Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the honourable senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end the investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the courtroom ranks.
They sent out every minute of the horrific testimony reports via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the rape case and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widely-followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that sets out arguments for appeal, which may occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports about the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - have created a "cirque atmosphere", such widespread and instant saturation with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The application may require appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced it during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms undermines the human rights of a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment given last week, claiming that the media were "only controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The appeal courses have for decades recognized that media coverage of known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgement, the United States Supreme Court annulled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere at the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie "Le fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review a half-century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford law school professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue states that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by counsel from Mr. Hayes, who may be discussed for years, which delays execution.
The defence counsel also contends, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors claimed to have been horrified by the victim's photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical before prosecutors, and that he abusedly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to a decision on a weekend.
Jurors weren't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the campaign by candidates for governorship and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to attract the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily bustle of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," wrote lawyers, "didn't look like anything seen here in New Haven before, and maybe even nationally."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the communiqués given more slowly was a ludicrous view that would deplete the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, which had overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring cleavage closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilization erupted in Washington this week.
Is it an advance sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation towards the front or an illusory moment before the early return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not give rise to any breakthroughs on the major issues to be addressed during the "Boying Duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least one polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The public meeting of the Committee on the President's deficit on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but that still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and mutual testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while attempting to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
For this reason, the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or rights, both sides remain miles away.
However, the November election moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of the “Boytish duck”, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is conceivable on the extension of unemployment benefits, whether because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for workers without employment.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism plans on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "Boytock Duck", with the ratification of the New START Pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "call Duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely or inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, which suggests that there should be little or no reason for compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston envisages two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama's budget, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the response of the public.
Anyone who will be judged to be losing will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But it would nevertheless be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more significant election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization presented this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find a common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. publicized documents describe Moscow as a hare of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and has passed to the Kremlin a part of the bribery and protection money it collects, reported the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out enormous rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its part while the money walks up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been removed.
It was written while Jouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he declared the following to a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unheard of that it would be for foreign diplomats to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government worked more as a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means "the roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB shakes the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The Embassy's note conveys reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
In India's view, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are at least classified as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was carried out only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir the discontents within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is resolving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin assumed that WikiLeaks' documents could be manufacturing and reacted angryly to the remarks that US diplomats had made in appellant Batman and in raping Medvedev with Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Red Khmer veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with low quality concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng's secondary school mentioned the man who built it, the last head of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Reds to the northwest of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, taught the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, at 35 years of imprisonment, the former head of the sadly famous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, best known as "Duch".
In the face of this evolution, anxiety has increased with former Khmer fighters from Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Director of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overturned the government of Pol Pot-U.S. in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements visited in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary headed the guerrillas of their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defecate the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held his head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have submerged in the black misery, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have held their positions as a local leader in exchange for having deposited their weapons, they are low-ranking, unqualified farmers.
"These people have received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a business setting that is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court has also raised concerns here.
The court should, early next year, begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to judge senior leaders and main perpetrators of crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded sceptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court begin to impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the weeds and scattered with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone dealer on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day, she planned to go to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to waive its military grade uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov here on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But the US officials said in Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This paved the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the issue by about 500 pounds, according to one official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organized at Obama's initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to offer an invitation to the former Soviet republic after the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 nuclear security summit nuclear security summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton described the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama committed in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Lukashenko said that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept high-enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," Loukachenko said.
"It's our product...We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago, however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A thorough coordination and organization have been implemented to build confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the energy department specializing in the Reduction of the Global Threat.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, in a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tense for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"All while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and indispensable for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has issued no objections to CIA flights
The government has not objected to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing itself of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "succeeded the Government of Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to thefts of intelligence above Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken to the void," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney Vicente González sent the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly among Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a fiery rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses concern about the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if the revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide who passed to confessions complained in network of the "accompaniment" of being a mother
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician Terror"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she uses as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two from Noia, the village of Coruña of which she originated.
The messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
Another new boyfriend was discovered shortly after that.
The elusive was Alberto, a young man from Lausam, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she lived for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied him for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idylle has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was alone in Minorque and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and vexed because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she's talking about a mobile message she just received, "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she talks about her return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to go to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if that person is not my mother," a doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there was another post.
When she hit him, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"César is happy on one side, but he's not happy on the other."
"On one side he is with me and this place likes him a little, but another he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) a few hours in summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to e-mail, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On 30, another one: "The child is well, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm ahead of the money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror to Galician (epigrapher) ".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had happened so that she didn't tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday, from the Menorque Judicial Prisons Centre.
Lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she can't remember how the facts had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecutor sought a psychiatric trial.
The members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the CSP would lose 9 seats in Congress.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these committees normally double the one it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes at the 2008 general elections, while the 2006 autonomics obtained 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a hijacking of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (he has now 10) and PSC would lose no fewer than 9 MPs (he has 25).
These calculations would show that Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a member - it has three now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and the people agree with the fact that the PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the City Hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only recorded a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, of which the mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they found themselves several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians held by officers of the General Information Commissioner for the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to ensure that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda forgery device was "weak" at the international level and therefore "its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, within the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The disbanded cell is the only reason that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why, apart from Thai services, other European police units participated in the investigations, so in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of similar blows to the one recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddic Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, another one was carried out, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who headed the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - whose part was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the integrates of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which resolves to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosophical-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address to half his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the guarantee that having obtained 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders take place in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to make the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated self-government and the elimination of tax on inheritances and donations thinner.
Details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will take care of the PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "lack of action"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Managers La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people who he was responsible for in the meantime.
The principal of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to charge the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility compels us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer in order not to have detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not cease to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and said that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a sign of imprudence on the part of anyone other than the accused".
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him to die by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of staff from the centre to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But lab tests will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 to 17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude through the various versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threats
Investors responded abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The differentials on the peripherals have ended, and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to make a mistake either, and the euro has barely experienced an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB asked us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will continue to be sold at quarterly auctions with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God will help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year trades in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change of market feeling after the words of Trichet.
The figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials, and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland is still in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of action which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with a strong demand and help dispel doubts about our ability to refine.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million cash available, three times more than March, very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "as opposed to being, to appear".
Courage, we can get out of this!
The President of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's Council requested by her sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest it, because he considers it "no law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for the companies does not appear to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from the Board of Directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the Shareholders' Meeting on January 18 this year whose challenge is recorded in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
El Enebro's Judicial Council for the 16th, convened by Magistrate Commercial No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of tuna in the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly fraudulent the Law and abuse of the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on January 18", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for once the assembly takes place, to be challenged, considering that it is "none of the right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage corporation and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requests the use of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the motion for a dispute for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, his history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the uphill trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the ability of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine to drive his car, in the Formula 1 world we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains of factories manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding flaws and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and run "in a few hours, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
Today, the Red Bull team is working 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of changes to the disease.
Siemens leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's disease except engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and autoclave production systems.
As the sole limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has deployed the high-tech plant to create and produce its disease in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two drivers, the Vettel Champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull Formula 1 hero is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety null.
The factory technology director Steve Nevey says five years ago it could be said that R & D progress in racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Vice-President Helena Herrero, Helena Spain, gave as an example the refurbished store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand names in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones opened were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM's personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneering pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP's IT equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'wanting' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it envisages a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be tried to compensate partially with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will have a three-year readability.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to win a market share by the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can leave the bank -, his great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while it exceeds 10% for companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year's Optima Master Plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalizes margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and funds pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity already move at the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We have not tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He claims that capital requirements "are greatly increased" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that ROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After making sure that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings fund mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks' merger process began, there were several entities which assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Executive and Managers of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarieta stated that the concentration process takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied in the way it is carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The transition of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a rather unhappy series of opinions about the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning," because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
Yesterday, the Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarieta, assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world and has awarded people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a "very important" and "go at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had benefited from the stress tests that the ECB had carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has laid down the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have led to a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to separate the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashs with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would abandon the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspension of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
Firstly, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from being introduced in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (a plan for fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that point on, she was the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and the public were against Greece's resurgence.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU Treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and to oblige private lenders at the same time to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the process of reform of the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us to all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that transgress the rules will be severely penalized, they can be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also support a share of costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The stakes are clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are being asked is much harder.
And what he must absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will allow greater tranquility to come to us.
And that we know how to grasp the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard this form and its dual statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, we have opened the way to the thesis that we need to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, one cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone that is too steeped in low-serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The Russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
In principle, the expulsion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23rd of November match against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (that their team was already winning clearly), the two players deliberately lost their time when they committed mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually become the leader of its group, the two players will perform the regulatory sanction during the next Auxerre Dam match and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in this case is due to the fact that this had as its protagonist a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his hymn shows the nobility and honour and who on past occasions condemned to a fine to his players for similar acts) and to the drama orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to his dilated history of his own hysterical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether with these actions a fraud of law is committed; for they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to elucidate its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of injury they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been jeopardized, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to in the correct game is to prevent the team from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate the normal characterization as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in hiding to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the adjudicator.
They were waiting, and they willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional misconduct discussed.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because of course the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated all at once and apart from that, with this action the players perform a sanction match and move to the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the cards occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, to climb the steps, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is nevertheless part of strategic decision-making that favours the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but instead they chose the time at which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without jeopardizing the penalty or running away from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way the director transmits them to provoke them.
The evil caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
This year's Dictatorship of the calendar concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes they also come back from groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting, this year's calendar (like the night of the Holy Sylvestre falls on Friday) focused the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which has been the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restoración in Barcelona, Gaietà Farras.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will be "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he added, and he recalls that customers tend to go down a level with the crisis, so that the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in the demand.
In a survey of various institutions in the centre, there was a collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they detail.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance the holidays.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased somewhat.
On the part of the patronage Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), his vice president, Henry Gomà, confides in the possibility of beginning to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, hope for the festivities has not decreased, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme raises major concerns in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filter confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that Pakistan's nuclear programme causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the Territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason for keeping the guard.
"Pakistan employs staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the area of nuclear proliferation and the elevated level of production of nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
A release from the Embassy in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make clear to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hunting the Wikileaks Chief
Obama will number a senior leader in the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol sends a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, or dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leaking of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, said that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 Interpol countries received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order for arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call to rede notice a free way for the arrest - which the national police force must carry out -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where they think Assange is located.
The movement insulted Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to respond by video-conference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange continues to find herself in an unknown place, but he does not shut himself up.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If one can show that she has been responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they are working at the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation application "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said to CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior leader in the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The trial of President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House as of January, asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further away was Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange should "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use a plane without a crew or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be too kind punishment," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eyelashes to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the umpteenth internal revolt within the ERC, without the north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinguished currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelashes that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to bring a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president to put his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to program the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders regard as a sure fact.
The leader of ERC has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make once and for all the organization be able to wash its linen family room.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the idealist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange of various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, which he highlights two.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., to include new figures coming from the Carod adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the model of assembly, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Conclave Convulse commissioned the management to revise the assembly model in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a 4-case decrease compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut down in the Valley of Mexico.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in organized crime theory.
Among the cases we mention that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of fire and the stroke of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a abandoned vehicle in the street Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning on Thursday, the four, the owners of land exploited in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots of fire in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On 7 November, two 30-year-olds were killed by an impact of fire at the head of the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
At Chalco, with the stroke of grace in the front, a man's corpse was found on a solitary path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a shot of gunfire of calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of Plaza Golondrina.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, the hands tied behind and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to be executed who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza, and two death warnings were discovered at the same time with the victims.
One day later, a box of cardboard containing a human head was found in the colony Valle de los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiap hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man was located in Huixquilucan, which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces were detected with her image.
By the end of the month, a man's corpse was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with their head enrubbed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens with those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with the hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the Center of Justice of the colony San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bottle with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its coal footprint and detailed its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, a representative of China at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that her country had made tremendous efforts to reduce coal footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he explained, in the last four years his country invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he stated that there are various current or completed multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Use Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another one for the change of filament lamps by energy-saving lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, it has detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we think.
For example, it has exposed that the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and plans to do another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The National Leader of NAP has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is legal.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is law.
In the interview before the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, where appropriate, to appeal to the National Council Order Board, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it was an approach for the successful and successful local elections," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that NAP is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we will enjoy it and make it stronger," he said.
He said that the council would probably elect the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, so it would give rise to "the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the revival recorded by the party in the past 4 July elections will be reflected in the next fight, even if "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "a lot of hopes have been made for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that Zedillo y Salinas' governments have been better than Fox y Calderón's governments; that they start defending them; that they go out of the 'armoire'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make such expressions as he did in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no such thing as censor.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for paperless students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," the American president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitté Obama.
His short message kept open a cybernetic link with a broader document asking the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation was imminent.
"I have a vote that we expect soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the government's funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem was resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize paperless students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if it would be most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the competition of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations play an intense lobbying role to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they weren't going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger barriers of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the finger on the beach
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which participants spread the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound?What do you expect of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the title of his question (pending another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the plague "...is embarrassing us", the Argentine writer gently threw the audience, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated table by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa as the first person who seeks to know what the "pleasure" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without obtaining an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my fort, it may be my pleasure".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is opened in reality, the symbolism is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I was only able to know that it is really open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that he called Eloge à l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With a touch of magical realism, he speaks of a famous deafening that touched clouds, had people go back who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later on America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the accounts of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in such a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked the modesty."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, one no longer knows which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Cervantes Tradition'.
"It's because of his legacy that we're what we're told."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauds the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The must on the beach.
The Cuban-portorian has put her own on the great plague of social violence that her country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about drug trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "this must on the plague of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuancer means many times to pose the finger on the plague and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and also bother the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting us to regain the meaning of writing.
Roman to hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he was able to achieve three times the decisive series.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he was able to reach three times the decisive series, even though until now he did not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
The Argentinian ended up consoled with the medal of subchampion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The sanctist strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, Rubén once again suffered a setback, because his team made an equal match of 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump at the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to separate himself from the evil in order to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points in the finals would be.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the umpire blows the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to pull out we were already prepared to run and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the match we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to hold the title in our hands, hands he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer happen in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a champ technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to the Visa Requester Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the procedure for processing visas to the Embassy and consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to apply to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC, according to their English acronyms) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will present certain advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer necessary to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another payment for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a unique payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only come to the nearest CSA where the documents will be presented and their fingerprints will be taken.
Because biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants for the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrophiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she cited the press, NASA assured that she would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an atmosphere that we thought is too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Anyway, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the real scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the Geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence et Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress there appeared an opponent bloc led by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Parliament, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they have reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, on the side of Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the directorship chaired by Paniste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo pointed out that with these reforms in an institutional way, political marginality is constituted by PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from a political will and if they did not, they would be once again served by both parties and that will end the opposing coalition.
"Just here has arrived (the opposing coalition), this is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, for Congress, after having been monopolistic, to be now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they now talk to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"What they don't leave with the 15 cupulary agreements that are probably going to be 25 Members of Parliament, now at the five that we're seeing, separated into different fractions, we decided to join together to find a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they did, that they decided, we're outside and we disagree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Hall pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With the latter, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, the last cheque number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "supply account clearing".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, in accordance with the provisions of the Act when a business is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Northwest had published a revision of the cheques issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the City Hall paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
The tourist sites should be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the foreign tourist accident due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlán has asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby businesses.
"Policians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do it, so it has through preventive interview and not just make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, we must maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They were not given the attention they needed, and this kind of fact underlines something that is known to everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourist Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Heavyly Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a decent and free working legislature of agreement between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and confronts major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislature was established by seven political forces, 19 MPs of PRI, 13 of PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, with a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new components of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that the MPs actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into carnival masks of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor makes to advance.
"We will ensure that they do a decent job and especially engaged with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking economic growth from the state, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Governmental Tourism.
"I realized that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and that it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and that competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources for detonating tourism projects that help to give State security and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are desired by the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, four, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a doll Barbie.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests a one-year-old dress.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we will see, my son', because it was very expensive," recalls Cayetana sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, was wearing the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, was wearing the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, was wearing the size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Cherche Roi Mage, giving a toy or money to the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
Some 10 searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have served the production of drugs.
"Environ 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashich, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were to appear at the courthouse in Sherbrooke within the hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Regie participated in this police operation.
Inland migration can continue without a problem.
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says, should address the problem of vessels dealing with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be beaten while the three opposition parties said Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be held for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill, because he took the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that her party was not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Chow.
"We don't support the Conservatives' bill because it takes on refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians massively tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it rejected it.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would seek a vote so that every member who opposes will then explain himself to his electors.
The new unit does not make unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, contends that this idea was not dated yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as of January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was not necessary any more for the Beijing public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as a "lape out of a hat" and a "worked solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, just say so."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest struggles not to want to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believed that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent scout is not the only project in Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy precipitation that has been on several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slide would have taken place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road's been jammed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
Sectors north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the source of the snow already accumulated in some areas, there is concern about the spillage of several streams.
Warnings of flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Rivers Ouareau and the Achigan in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and in the Oak, in Lotbinière, were being flooded and kept under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy precipitation has led to the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildara and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the flood of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on the alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
For its part, the Quebec Crus Forecast Centre issued warnings on Wednesday for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec's radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his coarse wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr.Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some statements contained "the inaccurate information on social assistance, the unduly negative representations of Haitians and the coarse language that does not fit the broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Joint Front of Social Assistance Persons.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had estimated suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes at issue of "Dupont the noon" addressed a delicate subject in an equitable and appropriate manner."
No blame was therefore retained in his place.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then surrendered to a face-to-face media that had caused a lot of reactions.
CHOI's host stated that he had made no donation to help Haitians because it could not be known with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect was unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the facilitator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond his obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station that, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A king of the kungfu in Montreal
The Montrealers of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing goes up on the tatamis and rings of the world looking for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and committed for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories, he explained."
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the World Cup of San Shu."
"The fighters who ended up among the top four at the world's last championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot strokes, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the sympathetic Gaillard."
"This is a bit the equivalent of the Lumpine Stadium (the biggest stage in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily provided $450 million in contracts for engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies that has obtained the most important, that of the stewardship of the project, for an amount of $295 million without tendering.
This consortium called Energy Gerance was set up in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gerance Consortium reached the lucrative contract without a call for public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and raise prices.
"This is the new way to do collusion and bring down competition."
"That is to say, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now they are doing it in an open way," said Pequis MP Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Natural Resources, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collision for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she fished, arguing that the PQ had been "bad" and had "missed".
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the QP apologizes.
Consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in view of the magnitude of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A rapid overview of the register of companies in Quebec allows for the number of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a special way since the 1970s".
The great boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it stressed that the project's management contract was granted on a voluntary basis.
"If you go on tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," said Laporte.
This contract to the Energy Gerance Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has raised 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without its participation in Energy stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 stewardship contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the QP is also linked to those companies that "finance it," before he said that it was rather his leaders.
Responsible Consumer Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the stakeholders of sustainable development, but also in the fair trade marks and eco-certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, although he bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption roam, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even calls a brake on his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another observation is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be environmentally responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumer information, however, appears to be essential to stimulate this part of the currently driven consumption by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the burners by 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are also distrustful of the alleged performance of green products or services they seek to place in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all changed their brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also favoured purchases from shopkeepers in their neighbourhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Quebec Homo consumer likes to present himself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce his environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transportation or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which just took its first shot.
A State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but with only one loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which hoped for a gift of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy from Daniel Langlois the complex cinematographic eXcentris on the boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full cinéphilic vocation, do not obtain what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least from the opinion of the sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who piloted the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the firm arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the State's donation must really be ruled out.
It should be recalled that the Association des proprietaires de cinéparcs et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the environment called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, has for ten years carried the copyright cinema to its premises after having financed its own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of halls for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalize his clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three halls next February 27th by projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des deux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil over what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but at the same time they betray their sense of superiority towards Canada.
For example, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread in the public square yesterday, offer more disturbing details than substantial content to put under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the midst of the federal election campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gave some explanation for the situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to discuss internal issues of daily life rather than bring this election to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands, at least, the "suffering silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of one candidate, one party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the early February vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will be posting its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan," says Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast at CBC refer from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or abductions for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits warm up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee echoed in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations proposed in Cancún a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction required to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, with electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitter countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should shift global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will have to subtract from this balance sheet 5 Gt to stabilize by 2020 the rise in climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like the ones launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations to fluocompact bulbs as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce waste electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesperson from the head of the United Nations."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday poll.
About forty minutes before the expiration of the deadline, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied Wednesday in the world so that the CIS would finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudous" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of the voters held by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
However, the opponents of Gbagbo feel that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denied any connection with the former rebels, found the delay in the announcement of the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew he had lost it and that he filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the President's office on Sunday was supposed to be the culmination of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ITB) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), showing the corrected data of the seasonal variations (CVS) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More generally, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% by including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 15-24 year olds were unemployed within the meaning of ILO.
The seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 point over three months and over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 years or over, and 6.6% in the case of the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini under review and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53, leader of waste-processing companies and brother of the president PS of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and imprisoned at the arrest house of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, retaliation, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," said AFP's lawyer, Florence Rault, prior to his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS fort in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, to send a memo to the judge before his hearing in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday evening and misappropriated.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the dumps he had to handle.
As to the award of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was examined Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General at the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is pursued for "trafficking influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are examined for "the removal and diversion of public property by a person responsible for a public service mission", the other for "the complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guerini's company, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "the abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who had recently been involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies had served to launder money from great banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
As a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for the award and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysee has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "expionage", held the opinion in haleine in France, put diplomacy in alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the careful eyes of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, up to giving them advice on the treatment of their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to acknowledge the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a cruel light.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Councillor of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richer, accompanied by the Director of the Northern Africa and Middle East Orsay Quai, Patrice Paoli, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcible nationals in Iran.
"Faites of noise," they say, "mate continually" in the media the words "rights of the fundamental man," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more so as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
For, past the attempts of discussion through discreet channels, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will intervene on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (EUR 230 000).
And he says that the Elysee anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
An information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States calls for extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, questions this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of nuclear material, Majid Khakavand's expansion is a bad news.
Has France accepted a bargain?
Iran's liberation from the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richer said that this was not the case.
The Elysee, he said, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back to the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysee's advisor composes a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not cleaning up its efforts, through press releases and "runs", to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears its fruit since several press articles impact the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes the "blitz" media of French officials.
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy is asked in Paris.
"Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then examines the reasons why the Elysée was forced into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immerited".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demont to Syria which praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richer told him, "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the department head in charge of the bill.
The online games will be available again at 6:00 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he has specified.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, added the person responsible.
It will also make it available to people who request it free software that allows them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world's online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates organizing countries
Due to suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying may take a step on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa queen competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides a measure of the economic and political issues of a World Cup.
As a result, backstage treatments may last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh too much for the 22 members of the executive committee at the voting time.
The Sunday Times, which led to the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temerii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football that only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC handed over a layer of it, with a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to discontent Fifa and embarrass English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the JO-2012 organization in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's blason to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spanish-Portugal duo does not lack any assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could give rise to their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, which has become a heavy outcast despite the shortcomings in its record (stadas, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favourites.
First global economic power, headquartered by the main sponsors of Fifa, the country seems to have a lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very good project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two co-organizing countries in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by the Fifa, which would de facto render Asian chances obsolete by 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new boundaries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (because of the time lag) by European countries, the war nerve for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had pretended to be he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant to the Elysee calls another.
So the current Head of State will be running in 2012.
But the evidence does not make good cleaning with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we must act as if the doubt still existed.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing in it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a severe air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he mentions in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a bit of fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The President recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year-olds to two.
He made a statement, not an ad.
This is not the first time he mentioned the Presidential, the tone of humour, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think I'm thinking about the next step."
His remarks yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they raise comments, that's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race on the one hand.
But it's not the high school entry of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because its candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS demand a more early battle order than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrected Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to keep purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the ways out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions, will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is to aggravate a more than tense situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it felt that the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)".
The ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, at his hearing at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, did not appear to be more dissatisfied with his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of state securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will maintain its main unchanged policy rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, almost 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, she would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the anticipation of a continuation of purchases is clear (see page 29).
Economists also don't expect any significant change in leadership.
While lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB is still making unlimited allocations of cash under generous conditions and for periods of between one week and three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's substantially modifying her program."
"If not to take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to animate an atonous market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," testified a major bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, the situation got a little relaxed yesterday, with the reflux of the bond rates at 10 years.
A precarious quiet return.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the 210 basis points record and the price of cover contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown at 263 points, leading to a certain crowd in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand arm, Gianni Letta, was "very concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atoning of the tax returns that go with, making the state run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be put in place after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are fewer than those requested from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held by the end of March.
There would then be a period that would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde was still hammered yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I think it has been shown on Sunday and at night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary zone."
Although all relevant, yesterday's relaxation of the European state bonds rates brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start to normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade the debt rating of Portugal, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, which particularly weighs on banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so as "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and its dangers, the European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anticrisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the colligator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform extreme-oriented investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issue of FSF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told the Reuters agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct IMF commitment.
The countries which are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to more closely related austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both have to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are necessary to restore confidence for a long time.
Finally, European donors are talking about the options available to speed up the process of standardizing sovereign bond markets.
Throughout Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advance in the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about EUR 100 billion would be "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The negative episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, ranging from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower-Normandie regions, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, prevents Metéo France.
In the Armor Coasts, several departments were banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The secondary network traffic in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights to Roissy Paris airport and 10% to Orly due to future snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on transport modernization in Ile-de-France has been full, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Metro Grand Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state has announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical outline, it is this amount that will then allow the GSP to borrow in the markets a share of the funding of its double loop.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Financial Amending Law, which was discussed in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a refurbishment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
That would bring back how much?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris within the scope of the project", can be read in the explanatory statement.
In the GSP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the moment revenue is created (the two taxes, ndlr), one can cover the studies over three years and then tap in the 4 billion afterwards, it is explained."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn up as soon as possible."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, could provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears only as a scandal in the face of hypocrisy which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each file made up of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reported what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi is the owner), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricature profile had long been for cabaret sketch artists.
The rule that secret records should be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every repeated book (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the earlier books.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (he does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to occultism believe only to what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for classified files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of a limited mind) the head of secret services (unless he could be, as I know, editor in Libération), who do not hold as true as what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of states can telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small performance exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place US diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can grasp the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims as much as the "torreals" in crisis.
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
In Orwell's time, all power could be conceived like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely revealed since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power eye.
But when one demonstrates, as it happens now, that even the cracks of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to remove all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too much harm to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put in place any reserved information - it would result in it being published on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it's just as obvious that with the current technologies, it's hopeless to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, bearing only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in closed key drawers: in the background, the Watergate spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving in crabs, that is, behind bars.
A century after the wireless telegrapher revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired (telephone) telegraph.
The videocassettes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the editing, while now the (numerical) CDs only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communications policy and technology should return to horse-cars.
One last comment.
Once, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
It is now the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France screws up its promises of financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of rapidly released financing (such fast-start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French dolls are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has come out of the great game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is significant and valued at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
In 2010 the EU announced €2.2 billion, making it the right way to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that the funding for "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or at the overall level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there are no rules and each chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ lent is equal to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At the most, it should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass tour!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand, the evolution of action over time and on the other, the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she believes that she spends €420 million "new and additional" in consistency with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that Bercy has achieved arbitration) could have a negative double impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely expensive...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the huge UNFCCC machine.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, lessons from this first year of early funding are essential.
First, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Child-ingested pesticide alert
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Future Generations Association (former Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the food generally consumed in four meals and one inlay in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as colds, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The scale of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five substances classified as carcinogenic, some as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is a concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as about twenty residues that may disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, which is intended as an embodiment by the study, has traces of six chemicals, although a fungicide is prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans in Kenya, which are included in the luncheon, on which the study has detected traces of a strong insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and gum chewing were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
