Accumulated incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with VOCID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, that is, an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that the majority is recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had only occurred in Italy.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of COVID-19 cases reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that in the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar VOCID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as at 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of informed COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is in spite of the different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm VOCID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
The data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, it should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk >90 % overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the death of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80 000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, leading to a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to their homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects people older than young people and more men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research issue.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Day of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgivable memory for all Chinese people, who have been urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 countries more from around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, including their virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this rapidly developing new subject.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, unknown pneumonia conglomerates were reported for the first time on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence became known.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of healthcare providers was reported, suggesting that transmission among humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the origin site of an infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries around the world (fig. (fig. 2).
Since the situation evolves quickly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and around them.
On average, there were 5 days (2 to 9) between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (range 3.0 to 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially by 23 January 2020, coinciding with the pre-Spring Day mass mobilization time in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a large and wrapped subfamily of viruses that contain a single-sense chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alfacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
Spiga glycoprotein (S) of the envelope joins its cellular receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidil peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the nucleocapside proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original shoot site: the Huanan seafood market of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. revealed the complete human ACE2 electronic cryomicroscopy structure in resolution 2.9 Å, in conjunction with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate host
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to bats-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and it remains to dilucidate the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the pangolines (long-hoc mammals fed with ants and usually used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99 % genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference propagated by the whole of two genomes remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective for disabling the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the guest through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll receptors (TLRs), NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Co-operating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend the cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and at worst, multi-organic failure and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance in clusters, affects the elderly more likely with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to get infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographic of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected people will be expected to transmit the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever or symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest lethality of the MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with SRM.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2 per cent when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and stood at 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
It is therefore much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
The appearance in clusters usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can re-contract the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and the reactive C protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the dimer-D level, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are detected in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral emeriled glass shadows or opacities in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRD).
When ARDS are produced, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MRS.
The detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer solely based on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol to use the SHERLOCK CRISPR-based technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre) using a graduated rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table (Table 2).
These therapies include currently in use or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops first antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express the ACE2, such as those of the digestive tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory care is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need assistance with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of heart failure or potentially fatal respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokines storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL6 receptor antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are modulation of T-cell-led immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF block; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a suppressor of route 4 of cytokine signalling, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis noticeably.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
The efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed at the time of this analysis.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, has been verified.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other monocatenary RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The extraction of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not novel.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in the blood.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, blood plasma was extracted from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 severely ill patients were injected.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, certain disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly resulting in fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
The MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend to a large extent on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of the MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific VOCID-19 therapy, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly close comparison, since many other impact factors, such as patient quantity and severity, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of western medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only.
Most surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM is still awaiting more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with COVID-19 suspicion or confirmation are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantine people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the outbreak of SARS, a series of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons with suspicion and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission of animal and human reservoirs infected with susceptible guests, and usually complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate powerful, long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity to protect against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical trial is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
On the other hand, there are still sporadic cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be recovered gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on informed clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred more in people aged 30-65 years and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required more likely intensive care had underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably higher than those who did not require them (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor in the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require more intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 cholangyocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictive factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of VOCID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine cinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Thus, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As previously described, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as previously described, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, since in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper airways and causes mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms in the early phase of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or during incubation may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission was not mostly in the early phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downhill phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become an influenza-like cyclical episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Originally it was predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by means of strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infectiveness and eventually extinguishes or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in faeces, suggesting a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by infections in our foster care centers, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 providers of medical care.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transients in contact with infected patients or people.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (series number 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the droplets of liquid of a potentially infected person from transmitting through the air or clinging to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate them completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the sized SARS-CoV and both measure about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must use custom-made isolation coats to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite using an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also use protective masks or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
It is considered that three feet is a proper distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alertness in China for its experience with the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured the citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain the disease.
This message significantly relaxed the public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Party, and the critical moment to contain the disease at the minimum scale in Wuhan was wasted.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, since each word matters to citizens and can change their attitudes or decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical information, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 countries more around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects more people older than young people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive results in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress made in the investigation of COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original guest, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to slow the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurrect at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitted among humans?
Will it become a world pandemic, become extinct as SARS, or will it resurrect periodically as flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many others.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have fuelled the coronavirus and its guests, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as the common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the coronavirus in the center of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
The coronavirus infection of humans is a zoonosis and we would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of the coronavirus of humans.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Guests of intermediate reservorium of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigate the interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also shed important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and on the transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different coronaviruses of humans from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviridae, which includes a group of single-catenary RNA viruses with envelopes, is the coronaviridae family.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, by the crown form they have under an electronic microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicant polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiega (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of accessories proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alfacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-coronavirus.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold or diarrhoea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogens and cause severe infection of the lower airways in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that coronavirus infection of humans is generally harmless.
The outbreak of SARS that took place in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today's history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later called SARS-CoV-2, is the causing agent of the ongoing disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been charged more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91 000 people as at 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and the factors that restrict jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and the intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of the spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenicity of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that parental viruses of human coronaviruses are not normally pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the evolution trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analyzed in this context.
The coronaviruses of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of HCV-229E of nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold was first isolated, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had common cold symptoms, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial pass in lactating mice' brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other pathogens of the respiratory tract, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed throughout the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a human coronavirus well documented in the history of humanity, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from superproparators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and elevated creatinine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to lower respiratory tracts, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four acquired human coronaviruses in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe infection of the lower respiratory tracts in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to communicate efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in laboratory are from the Middle East, there have been cases of occasional imports of close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were registered, with a high lethality of 34.4 %, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid-December 2019, clustering of patients with pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and, in addition, called the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4 %.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogen, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between that of SARS-CoV and the four acquired human coronaviruses in the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in coronavirus infections of acquired humans in the community, which includes the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns that are characteristic of both the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human passes, as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, such as the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after human passes, will have an influence on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four acquired human coronaviruses in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses causing serious human diseases and humans developing serious human coronavirus diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses should be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the limiting factors of the host.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 persists and the more infected the more likely it will be to adapt completely to humans.
If adapted, human transmission would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogen SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human goals, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four acquired human coronaviruses in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogen than the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt completely to humans and will circulate among humans without an animal host of reservorium or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, we will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservorium, intermediate and human coronavirus amplifiers.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reservorium host hosts a long-term and continuous human coronavirus.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are natural guests of human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogen.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of the infection in humans and perform the amp host function by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmits to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Civets of masked palms (Paguma larvata) and a pet on live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were registered after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palms or farms without exposure to live animal markets mostly gave negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of masked palms would only act as an intermediate amp, but not as a natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the chances of several species of small mammals also acting as intermediate guests amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Later searches of the SARS-CoV natural animal host revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called HKU3 Rhinolophus bat coV related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herrat bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It was shown that the WIV1 obtained from a faecal sample of bats uses the ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, the serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptide peptide 4 (DPP4), for entering the virus.
Polymerase RNA sequences dependent on MERS-CoV RNA phylogenetically are closer to its beta-coronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a living MERS-CoV in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its nearest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reserve guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in neutralising antibodies to the MERS-CoV specifically, as have camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudation of dromedaries, which supports even more that camels act as guests of good reservorio bona fide of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels propagate viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of spread of bat viruses.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of SRM do not have a history of camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species hosting SRM-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat coronavirus RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus finis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to assign a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of bats that are virtually identical.
Presumably, the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals at risk, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sub-lines of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of receptor binding (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and the RatG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which are also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than that between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals should still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin, beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the beta-coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter proposal defends a recombination between beta-coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Apalaches Mountain Colonavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat had a close relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge to date of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species until it infected humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of HCoV-229E is not known so precisely.
Alphacoronavirus of bats has been found closely related to HCV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alfacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-coronaviruses related to HCV-229E are diverse and not pathogens in bats, while alpaca alpha-coronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas acquire alpha-coronavirus related to human HCV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit the HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-coronaviruses act as the genetic collection of the HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests who transmit the viruses to humans, in particular in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats into the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, who have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reserve guest.
The MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolines beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogens in pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of the beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, such as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between animal-to-human SARS-CoV-2 species should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the spare host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolines could be one of the guests intermediate amplifiers in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses crossing the barriers of species.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-catenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronavirus could be considered "moderated" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the coronavirus adaptation phase to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclea reading test, whose elimination results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inadmissibility.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about one million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their efficacy quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of coronavirus exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of co-evolution between species, which leads to the emergence of new co-ronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is backed up by the unique copious open reading frames and the functions of the proteins encoded towards the direction 3' of the genome.
Thirdly, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently templates during RNA replication by a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest who acts as a mixing vehicle, chain change occurs frequently during transcription of RNA of coronavirus.
Full length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-guest interaction with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis of isolated strains of human and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, particularly with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the response of antibodies of the host.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318-510 in fragment S1, which binds to the ACE2 human and its receptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize the receptors of ACE2 of several animals, including bats, civet, mouse and mapache dog, which allows transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human viruses and civets in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spigal protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be crucial for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of S protein binding with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study of electronic cryomicroscopy indicates the 10-20 times greater affinity of this union compared to that of the ACE2 human and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other receptor may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptide N in HCV-229E and septic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and guests of natural reservoirs of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses should usurp the factors of dependence on the host and subvert the factors of restriction of the host in order for transmission between species to be successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-guest interaction should still be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome investigation of the dependence and restriction factors of the host for SARS-CoV-2 could be useful using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronaviruses appear: we start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination, also boost the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the additional proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but it has been determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A typical elimination of 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV was found in isolate strains at the start of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, which identified a large number of smaller recombinant regions in the polymer RNA dependent on RNA.
Recombinations locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results from releasing the viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the immune system of the host.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 intact in bat and camel viruses related to HCV-229E was observed, alfacoronavirus alpacas presents a single nucleotide insertion, which causes a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in its reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
The bats appear to be well adapted to anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules of the larger histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (ROS) species generated from elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of coronavirus and affect the reading test of exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in your reservorium guests, such as bats and camels.
They are vigorously replicated without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this, the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans are rooted.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of coronavirus.
The same delinking strategy for immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the occurrence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat coronavirus has been found that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in the markets have been found to contain viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Substantially homologous pangoline beta-coronavirus has been found at SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangoline could act as one of the intermediate guests or that beta-coronavirus of pangoline could bring fragments of genes to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered protagonistism due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in contact between humans and civets in the markets, close the wet markets and kill the civets that were in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should withdraw from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coronavirus lineages of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals, it remains to be diluted in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks could appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating wildly.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, which would result in new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and response should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the zoonotic virus's natural reservoirs.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be diluted how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or their parenting viruses are expected to be almost identical in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspecting cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guideline for advice on the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference to fight this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory guideline that was published online at Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guideline and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support his important work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 (the seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological history with two points of the clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations should be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with respiratory fever or symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases with respiratory fever or symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as house, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total counts of white blood cells showing a count of normal lymphocytes, decreased or reduced in the early stage of onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against the negative-to positive SARS-CoV-2, or increase of the titular ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

In addition, there is increasing evidence to remind us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. must be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will arise and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and complying with the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely way to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
At an online briefing, the Director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
One hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was attending Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport for Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men who returned from Italy and also one of them.
As of 19 March, these three had already recovered.
Over a million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were registered, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Throughout the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only held between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended his order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia Lower Toilet Paper Limits by Transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their hygienic paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 in the event of self-absorbing.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to a parcel on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery," and said that the demand "had no precedents," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesman from Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger parcels from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer on Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult for them to do so.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He emphasized that the toilet paper is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide empty space in the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article in the shelves, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large quantities, panic would probably be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman for ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that they depleted the stocks.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time on the weekend of Labor Day.
The edition of NT News Thursday, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets initially were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of March 3, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of propagation and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has no precedent".
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked since the onset until the continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arises after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
Coronavirus 2019–20 pandemic is an ongoing disease pandemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an emergency of international public health on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and some 97 000 deaths as a result.
About 364 000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the case fatality rate is 4 per cent in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms, usually, is about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping away from others, and controlling and self-absorbing people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic disturbance, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by purchases motivated by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated via the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Owing to reduced travel and closures by the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an unknown group of pneumonia cases, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The majority of cases were related to the wholesale market for Huanan shellfish, therefore, it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat crownviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to develop symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old from Hubei province, could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to the reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under represented 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of persons tested for COVID-19, who obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had tested in more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of VOCID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March considered that the amounts of infections in Italy were significantly higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, most frequently 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, around 80 per cent of deaths corresponded to people over the age of 60, and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official records of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic, usually refer to the deceased who gave positive results in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without the test, for example, in their homes, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimation," a statement corroborated by the anecdotal reports of sub-continence in the United States. This underestimation is frequent in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As at 28 February, more than a dozen deaths occurred outside mainland China in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Generally, several indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The proportion of deaths in cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the rate of mortality from infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified deadline and consider a specific population from infection to resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the total mortality rate for pandemic infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the lethality rate.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease remains without available guests.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
China's main medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London, stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the study of Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical detachment and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, which will reappear every year".
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, production of spout in the respiratory tract (flemma), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blue in the face or lips; in the event of these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended. The greatest advance of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, do not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers advised to carefully control and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic persons range from a few to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more often than not, it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur in coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory drops may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by the air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are close or possibly inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before symptoms and in more advanced stages of the disease are manifested.
People obtained positive results in disease tests up to three days before symptoms occurred, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in the VOCID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that might have touched infected people.
The coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by contacting soap, which dissolves its protective wrap. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with beta-coronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from bat.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangoline viruses and human viruses.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share a maximum of 92% of genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be diagnosed provisionally based on symptoms, although ultimately it is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) polymerase chain reaction of infected secretions or CT images.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing the polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, albeit less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hysopo, although it is also possible to use a hysopo for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these showed that they were sufficiently precise to approve their generalised use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in X-ray images and computed tomography (CT) images of symptomatic individuals include opacities in asymmetrical disillusioned glass and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, diagnosis by images without confirmation by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared chest CT results with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that although imaging diagnosis is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect characteristics of the virus in the images, both with X-rays and with computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community propagation in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that healthcare providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile location data by Governments for this purpose has generated privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a declaration demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the VOCID-19 test. They are circulating erroneous ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal lavage and gourds with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDCs recommend that people wash their hands often with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have visibly dirty hands; before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies by contacting soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands with at least 60% alcohol in volume when no water and soap are available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without first washing them.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a surface of stainless steel), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5 % and iodized povidone at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with flexed elbows or a disposable handkerchief for coughing or sneezing, and discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance of the respiratory drops that disperse when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."The use of masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transportation or be in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend that people make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited going out into public spaces without wearing a mask or without covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam called for all people to wear a mask by being in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, demanded the use of masks by passengers on trains and buses in the suburbs.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go out into the open, while also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes measures to control the infection designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distance themselves from others.
Many Governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social detachment" with "physical detachment" to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social detachment" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation, instead of encouraging them to keep in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations for only having sex with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation was recommended at home for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-restraint, and many Governments have requested or recommended the self-restraint of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter instructions on self-care were issued to those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with generalized transmission are advised to make self-care for 14 days from the moment of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected people, in addition to introducing other measures to control the infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
Where it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the curve of the epidemic.
This decreases the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-care; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events of mass competition; community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity proved evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection and quarantine assessments located, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care in two thirds and half deaths, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The elimination may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), since, on the contrary, the transmission is reactivated quickly when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free-selling medications for the cold, drinking liquids, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes capacity-building and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to outbreaks.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on VOCID-19 testing, cancel optional procedures where possible, separate and isolate positive patients in VOCID-19 and increase intensive care capabilities through staff training and increased number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale market for Huanan shellfish, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed from which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, about spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation centre and an important railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders at the place or confinement) and curfews. On 2 April, around 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, meet some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 13 billion people are confined in India.
As of 26 March, 17 billion people around the world met some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, around one third of the world ' s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jishan observed a group of cases of unknown pneumonia, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While making these notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan to "cast rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission at first stated that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", on 23 January a health cord was announced that prohibited travel inside and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the spring holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. After the start of the global outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities adopted strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was essentially blocked and the outbreak was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the confinement had been imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details of when this policy will be completed.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for the signatures. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that it will begin with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to submit their respect online to comply with the physical distance in order to avoid the resurgence of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms.On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases remained in quarantine after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers gave positive results for the virus.
Airlines' schedules were also affected, and were therefore modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized programme to test the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with results available the following day and increased diagnostic ability to test up to 20,000 people every day.
The South Korea programme is seen as a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon so that they considered the outbreak to be mismanaged by the Government, or to commend its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a shorter day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all newly arrived persons from abroad are to remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing the virus from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of infections by SARS-CoV-2 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has set aside five billion rivers to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans to limit travel between cities were announced, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Nowruz year continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of the allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number in the country since the outbreak.
As at 17 March, at least 12 expolitics or politicians in Iranian exercise had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions against Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the outbreak was confirmed in Italy, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of non-related cases of COVID-19 were detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, "It will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sporting events were fully suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics on the screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy overcame China with the highest number of deaths related to coronavirus in the world after reporting 3405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoverys in Italy, and most of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy from a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social distancing or massive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he did not recommend social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those who were considered strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through fines and the dispersal of meetings.
The closure of most of the companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware, gas stations and workshops.

Despite this, the United States had a slow start in conducting tests, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
Tests were carried out by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of non-governmental test kits (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (after a medical order was required).

On the other hand, China’s aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank initiated emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when accused the Chinese authorities of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic in the face of the Lunar New Year's holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, although "definitely it was not a recommendation made by WHO," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak an international public health emergency (ESPII), the sixth SPII since the first invocation of the measure during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that interfere unnecessarily with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO made use of the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "that have no systems to detect people who contracted the virus, in case they have them."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community "to invest or pay more in the future."On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide "the power of the entire United Nations system to respond."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was set up to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and communicableity of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to carry out visits to the site to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and noted that, although it was very early to call it a pandemic, countries should still be "in preparation phase".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a declaration would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the crown virus outbreak pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned, both about the alarming levels of propagation and severity, and about the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received significant criticisms of what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed respect for the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detained persons, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, with the aim of helping countries learn from each other and facilitating a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom Office, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed due to their management of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was taken to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the onset of coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the USA or Italy.
Donald Trump's administration of the U.S. has referred to coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," and stated that "China censorship overfed a virus that has now become a world pandemic," which, in turn, was identified by some critics as racism and "distracing the failure of its administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing an apparent communications stratagem in the National Security Council, citing the strategy as "All about China."
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Communications such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send help to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent aid to these last two countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries in their own country.
And disputes have been reported regarding masks among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of breathers destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China replied bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" claiming that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching an offensive of "geopolitics and diplomatic" seduction.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical help to the United States.
The spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and equipment cover momentum, they will also be able to match if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives of not only United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, in addition to fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, and said that his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak called for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the presidential election of 2020. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will remain in quarantine for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and punish those who are deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Coronavirus outbreaks were blamed for a number of supply shortages, as a result of the increased use of worldwide systems to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has published warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed purchases driven by panic that left the empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which caused a shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the supply of medical goods.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection teams around the world, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by acute food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the illicit accumulation and trade in essential products have been successful and have prevented an acute shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials freed the stock of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws requiring food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, China's economy was greatly affected in the first two months of 2020 because of the Government's measures to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, viral outbreaks have been considered a significant threat to global economic destabilization.
Agathe Demaris of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the global growth epidemic could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the supply chains of the world that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly became "returned" after a strong drop in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about coronavirus outbreaks, several U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reported their most pronounced drop since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the largest one day down from the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indexes ended the week with drops of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears for coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise companies sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's Day to 10 February, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in attention schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers from North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of between 50 and 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a fall of 33 to 43 % in pedestrian transit to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than had been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the highest point in the Wuhan epidemic, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were dumped into their homes in inner provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government help.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of unemployed Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages). According to Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment. About 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term employment compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The sectors of the performing arts and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of the organizations and the people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Cultural and arts organizations tried to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and support artists when possible.
By March 2020, around the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Lent Christian penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live Internet or television, while others offer places to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the Square of St. Peter empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the global sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "reschedule to a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming sites around the world closed and online poker tournaments were delayed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online gambling sites reported significant increases in their fees for new registrations. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, like Broadway's, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways of continuing to produce and share their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes were spread over coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of eastern Chinese and Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world that expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a just reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside of the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe that experienced a serious outbreak of the COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and ancient.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, suffered harassment in connection with coronavirus outbreaks.
The president of the state unity of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God came from them."
China's consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "mistakeful."In China, xenophobia and racism increased towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign" and intended for "descend."
Many newspapers with pay walls removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists decided to share their results quickly on preprinters such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
The antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms that were too mild to inform or were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported fatality rates, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Through the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hysopados or spurge samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hypos is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract by sucking catheter, or the material that is expelled to the cougher (sputo) can be used.
One of the first tests of polymerase chain reaction was carried out in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, South Korea’s Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Look for the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene in China. BGI Group was one of the first companies to get emergency use approval from the National Administration of Medical Products of China from a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic panel of polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated incomplete results due to faulty reagents, and an attack on the CDC test in Atlanta; on average, less than 100 samples per day were processed during the whole of February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only then was it allowed for the state and local laboratories to start carrying out tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of testing for COVID-19 based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits on the quantity were announced; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for VOCID-19 was developed and produced by the State Center for Research on Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the FDA emergency use authorisation for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
Because this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are around 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production for 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, in the hope that it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid influenza test.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computerized tomography] can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobary opacities in disillustrated glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain is developed, pattern in stone and consolidation.
According to a study in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, albeit less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs recommend polymerase chain reaction as an initial test.
Part of the immune system reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine the immunity and surveillance of the population. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories or through tests at the point of care.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For tests in central laboratories, only one peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For the tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture to the skin.
Unlike the polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step prior to the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of the viral RNA polymerase.
The antibodies, usually, can be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube," the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result within a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient will infect others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In testing in drive-through centers for the suspicious cases COVID-19, a health professional takes the samples with the appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea make some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of State Health Insurance Doctors said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the natural week of 12/20, at least 483,295 samples had been analyzed, including the week of 12/20, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only making more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On February 5, 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI launched an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chino:
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face quarantine had doubled without this ability to carry out tests.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
In March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reagents affected massive tests in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now doing more testing for coronavirus per person in its population than any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining the drive-through capacity and purchasing a mass production laboratory at the level of the Group 42 and BGI population (which was based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that sent low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demands and recommendations of the health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea tests helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over a number of years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programs as the best way to reduce the progress of the VOCID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hisopods and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "deficits"; the government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect collection of the samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that produced the wrong results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China produced the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown to the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
The testing, supplemented by quarantine of those who achieved positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contacted positive patients at SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who had positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With travel restrictions in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but the schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also monitored the pandemic with the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from outside, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent borders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have conducted more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to carry out tests and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the policy for conducting the country's tests.
A country that only tests persons entering hospitals will have a higher number of positives as % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if their hands are not washed before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or manipulating raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose rings, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medication or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in domestic deliveries.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in stature growth of children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced with the introduction of simple changes in behaviour, such as washing your hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes in about one third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children are charged per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath in a well-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce death by diarrhea to almost half and a quarter deaths by acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and causes the skin to become squamous known as eczema of the hands or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially frequent in health workers.
Handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fetal transmission of the diseases: after using the bath (weaning, defecation), after cleaning the tail of a child (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or manipulating raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a proper hand-washing technique should be used to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or manipulating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 per cent; the United States was about half with 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavioural change, to increase the adoption of the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times. Group handwashing of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwashing into children's behavior.
The “Essential Health Care Programme” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a tailored action to promote children’s health and education.
Disperse twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Elimination of skin microorganisms improves by adding soap or detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain acquired bacteria in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, CDCs say that "liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve the use of hands is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been intensively promoted for a health-conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptic agents preserve antibiotics resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent that protects the skin, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditioners for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to eliminate bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water to eliminate natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on the reduction of microbial load in the hands.
A hand or antiseptic disinfectant for hands is an agent without water for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, agents for the hygiene of hands without water and alcohol to rub (also known as a solution for hands based on alcohol to rub, antiseptic solution for hands to rub or disinfectants for hands) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickener agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants eliminate bacteria, bacteria resistant to various medicines (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based disinfectants that contain 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and from 99.99 % to 99.99 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient solution for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands should be used to rub, such as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants for rubbing, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid activity of removal of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for proper hand washing unless there is no water or soap available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may dry the skin, unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The dryness effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dryness of the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in the solution for alcohol-based hands to rub are very rare.
The least tendency to cause contact irritating dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not eliminate the organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand disinfectants largely depends on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulae using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or land can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if the land or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
WHO recommended that ash or sand be used as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water can be contaminated, while water temperature apparently makes no difference.
Flee your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Constrain for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and tighten for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Dry well with running water.
To rinse in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The parts that are most frequently forgotten are thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under nails
Artificial nails and enameling of peeled nails can house microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying up; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when no running water or soap is available, such as pouring water from a hanging cane or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home land" and other economic options.
A homemade tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jug of a rope and a lever driven with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, Westminster University, London, carried out a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42% in fingertips and 15% in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased on average 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also tested whether there was any possibility of cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, as stated, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes were observed in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with hand disinfectant wipes is an alternative during travel, when you have no water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectant should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The washing of the hands of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members that they wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Washing the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be folded together between the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a pork brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from recontaminating on those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate and prevent the transmission of pathogens.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related infections of the bloodstream by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a fact sheet demonstrating handwashing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's manual for hand hygiene can also be found on your website so that the public can make comments.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Times" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
after caring for patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap ( "medicinal" or "antibacterial" soaps) gives the handwashing agent the possibility of elimination.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which antibiotic resistant organisms are very frequent. To wash their hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a bit of chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry their hands after washing, a sterilized brush to scrub and another sterilized tool to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, the water in the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical coat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control the infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Common soap wash results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to antibacterial soap wash. When comparing hand wash with an alcohol-based solution with hand wash with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the alcohol rubbing reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spores difficult in hands than alcohol-based disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered to be an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few taps to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of entrenched habits and not the lack of soap or water.
Promotion of soap-washing can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to a long-term change in behaviour in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hands-washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF pushed the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting the washing of hands with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, in particular for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant scents called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the HIVIC-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right techniques to wash their hands" next to the toilets of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "to wash your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much wider phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and that she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more the elements for hand washing.
In addition, those people who have allowed their hands to be washed after such reflection, are less likely to be involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahahiism, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the wash-house in Christianity and Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to be washed after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhaism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to be washed before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace at the COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace before VOCID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal employment contact with the public and co-workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at medium exposure risk includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19 but who may be infected by current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of people and some large retail sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case a person with COVID-19 is present.
OSHA considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19, have a high exposure risk, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may lack work for getting sick, for having to look after others or for fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded and in terms of the means of acquisition of such goods (such as buying in non-peakable hours, by means of home delivery services or by car sales).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting those at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational health and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection teams are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard for the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g., respirators), used in an appropriate and systematic manner, reviewed frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and eliminated, cleaned and stored or disposed of in a proper manner so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal employment contact with the public and co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards that include covering coughing and sneezing, provision of paper and containers for waste, preparation for teleworking or step-by-step shifts if necessary, deter workers from using tools and equipment and maintain a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptom for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with generalized COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail retail retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and the higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective cover cover covers and the placement of a care service window for the customer to ask from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include recommending to sick workers who stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting shift shifts, suspend travel which is not essential to the existing COVIDID-19 outbreak sites, developing emergency communication plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, offering training and up-to-date training to workers on risk factors and prevention behaviours in relation to the COIDID-19, empowering workers with existing outbreaks of COVID-19, developing emergency communication plans that include a forum for this group and higher risk groups to address workers' concerns, offering up-to-to-to-to-home and up-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-job work skills and work teams, working environment, working teams, working methods, working methods of workplace, working methods such as ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '' means' means' means' means' means, ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means, ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means, ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means' means, ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' means' means', ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on an aeroplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew must use disposable surgical gloves to assist a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a dangerous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by illness, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal thing is that the medical check is done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and child care centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or chorus education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, staggering entrance and exit schedules, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate place for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the cancellation of classes may be considered. For police personnel who carry out daily routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are recommended to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of VOCID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning wipes before using them again and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the high-risk work of exposure are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected VOCID-19.
These become very high exposure risk jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected VOCID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some procedures for aerosol generation include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of corpses of people who had COVID-19 or were suspected of having it at the time of death; they are now at a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected of COVID-19, even when they are performed with aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure can be adequate in some health care and morgue environments.
Samples should be handled using Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter separate into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or are suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved or superior filtration masks should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program including adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, provide care or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, coats and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the permit to enter the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while several patients with the same diagnosis are provided, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic persons.

QUESTION: [Covid-19] To lighten the burden and prepare us for the future
DATE/EXPENDING TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we meet in singular circumstances.
The VOCID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities that we have with each other.
The challenges it presents have no precedent, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community construction that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern that we have seen among all of our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people with whom we are lucky to work are.
I could not be more grateful and proud that you are all my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to visit Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our partners receive their payment or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timelines
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our focus and timeline for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is a unpredictable place today, and whether you have to look after your loved ones, shop or go to your doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although you shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team to review the schedules and schedules to make sure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure that management is aware of your situation.)
The people who work for an hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff members who work hourly.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is their personal care.
What we ask you to do is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The Site Trust Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, are critical work that could require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and change our approach to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We do not plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our timeline greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to the delegates and the teams as soon as we have confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exposure and clean-up of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the VOCID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators going to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may take place.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely since now know that this mode requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of not more than one or two hours.
If longer meetings are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Set the meeting clearly with a list of items and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of video by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the well-being reimbursement for refrigerators.
Join the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
RR. HH.'s Operations Team is analyzing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase of the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as publishers, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to comply with their part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both that of Wikimedia and others.
Later, CRT will be working to set up a page in Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with the issues of COVID-19
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., coordinated universal time/07:00 a.m., Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are being heavily affected at the present time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you may need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, send an e-mail to Bryan Jutan, Director of Global International Operations, HR.H.
None of these changes should be considered a departure from our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and give the world the service in which it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of and care of your families so that they can find themselves in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
The ACE2 counters the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ACE2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptide M2 and a C-terminal domain renal transporter of amino acids of collectrin.
ECA2 is a unipasal membrane protein of type I, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ACE2 is split from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately is excreted by the urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is primarily attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to small bowel enterocytes, to venous arterial and endothelial cells and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The expression of ACE2marN is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striated body, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counteract ACE.
The ACE produces the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, the ACE2 produces carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Argo-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
The ACE2 may also split several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic in membranes of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main point of entry for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the union of the S1-pige protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes found inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host's TMPRSS2 protein, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that the reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help to combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ACE and standard ABR inhibitory therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so strong for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the lechons with lipopolysaccharides-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The average life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the 24-hour effect.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for people with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is high. rhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The applications of COVID-19 are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official backing of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimeter application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of massive surveillance through the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué to limit this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights established to respond to such abuse;
The significant participation of all relevant "stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) from Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used, rather than applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, networking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert about possible contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to the far-reaching changes to the privacy laws of the information after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As at 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research going back at least to 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leave the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location data or route intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Out-of-control applications: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the MPC Enigma SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect in achieving broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government implementation.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that, as they claimed, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance problems by distributing, first, the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for VOCID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
The analysis of these union sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against VOCID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed polymerase, helica, S protein and ribophosphate ADP.
Hussein A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests of the state of New York with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by an urgent authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorised as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but who cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Faculdade de Medicina de Langone is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipyravir, while the other half were administered umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing tests supporting the drug are scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
Drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there have been criticisms about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple phylovirus, pneumovirus, paramisovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with a more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are under way for people hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (ciclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
One form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, one phase II trial is under way and 200 serious patients will be enrolled in hospital in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is inscribing 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who breastfeed or do not have an affective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Heparin of low molecular weight is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs that developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM virus, SARG and Western Nile.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Humifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of VOCID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering significant investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the targets of the main platforms for phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (stage I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be planning or developing).
A phase I or II trial carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually at random, is placebo-controlled and performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet under human assessment (followed in the "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular subjection that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects testing in humans to begin in 2021.
Projects were announced for the development of vaccines at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology used in the treatment of neoantigenic vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that they had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a phase I clinical trial and trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it progresses rapidly, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and testing in humans is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19', at which the German Government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a RNAm-based vaccine.
The possible vaccine based on BNT162 RNAm is currently under preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists began testing animals for six possible vaccines.
Researchers from the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding for CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter VOCID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another shoot of coronavirus occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Faculty of Medicine at Pittsburgh University announced the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the vaccines of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from antigen specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy College announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacterium and produce virus-like harmless particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with animal models specific to VOCID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for live virus manipulation and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against ARAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against RAGS that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat ARAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is no confirmed vaccine against the SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that the existing research on the SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against the infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three more were underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various publications on social media refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the coronavirus of the ARAG.
b'The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress in viral pneumonia and multi-organic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before the symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of the polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hersome.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they are not used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal dripping and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organic insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of VOCID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected individuals present symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people without symptoms is not known at the moment and is being studied. Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1st. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both the sputum and saliva can have great viral loads.
Speak aloud releases more drops than when spoken with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth with a cougher can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside the people's dormitory gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through stools, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear the ease with which it spreads, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. soap products degrade the lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucinate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in an average of two days after the onset of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronavirus of related nature.
Outside of the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it revives its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme, which abounds more in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "scule" (pepomer) to connect with the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to receptor ACE2 in the heart.
The receiving ECA2 have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with VOCID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In the autopsy of people who died from VOCID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism due to epithelial cells expressing ACE2 from the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF secretor lymphocytes pathogens are correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretor monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of the respiratory tracts obtained by a nasopharyngeal herbate; however, samples of nasal or spout herbates may also be used.
Results are usually available between a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with the tests has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the University of Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular emeriled glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, disordered stone pattern (lobullary septal enlargement with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of VOCID-19 are available.
The main pathological results of the autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleurisitis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying in the house, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDCs recommend covering their mouth and nose with a handkerchief at coughing or sneezing and, if they do not have handkerchiefs, using the inside of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of fabric lids in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling crowd public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flating the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand-based disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsis of hands."
Glycerol is added as moistening.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other affected vital organs.
CDCs recommend that those suspected of having the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
The U.S. intensives and neurologists compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paremetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are carried out.
CDCs recommend that health care professionals take care of people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to prevent air transmission. CDCs highlight guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, the respirators are preferred (instead of the masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an urgent use permit (U.S.A.).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but effectiveness is not guaranteed against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
Where no masks are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, house masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipress in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some physicians prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (those over 60 years of age and, in particular, those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators are needed to have different modes of pressure control and PPTE to maximize oxygen supply while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
The oldest respirators may not count on high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remorse seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may be delayed until 2021, several medicines that are already being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in studies on the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary permission to plasma to convalescent as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also alerts local health officials. Analysis of the information macro-data of cell phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track the data of mobile phones of persons suspected of coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data of the location of telephones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile telephone operators have informed him that "anyhow, 40% of people continue to move."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel distress over quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease can follow a slight evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of getting a serious infection with the VOCID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARG virus and the SROM, but data from VOCID-19 are insufficient. In some people, VOCID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to the water respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory insufficiency, septic shock and multi-organic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired coagulation, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Coagulation alteration, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal function alteration is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to ICU, an average seven-day time between hospitalization and death occurred.
In a study of incipient cases, the mean time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8 per cent and among women it was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes were observed.
The image of the lungs resembled the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to United States March data, 89% of hospitalized persons had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Long-term sequelae of this disease are of concern.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ involvement.
This can also cause the syndrome after recovery after intensive care.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity appears to be possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that were subsequently positive in coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to transmission among humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was December 8, 2019.
In general, a number of measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate is 6.9 % (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The figure varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the mortality rate in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) dying from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, so there was relatively low mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004% of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those who are in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is narrowing only to 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are unknown, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were male and 72 per cent of the people killed by COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track sex information in VOCID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARA, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to viruses, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations, the name rises to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCov as temporary names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 indication that they do not use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hysopos and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves required during the night.
After the initial outbreak of VOCID-19, conspiracy theories, false information, and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease quickly spread over the Internet emerged.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY Trial to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds on efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, either inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the virus of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus to get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a four-volunteer vaccine in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an harmless copy of the genetic code of the virus causing the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of the Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and should be reported by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and possible drugs against VOCID-19 was under way. Several antiviral drugs are evaluated for the treatment of VOCID-19, including: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of an attempt on the effectiveness of remodeling.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and may be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorization for use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial barley of the S protein that performs type 2 transmembrane serum-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receiving ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 and has no known function in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. China's National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment schedules after a small study was completed.
It is in a national non-randomized phase II test in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify the releases of cytokine, these effects are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled unrandomized evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from VOCID-19 is being investigated as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with non-conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mechanism of expected action by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died by COVID-19 after generating awareness about the spread of the virus.
