The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of ČEZ’s shares reached about half their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of the commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended about 6%.
The downfall this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilization plan, is also expressed here.
Fall of actions in Asia
The actions of the Asian Scholarships lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, although throughout the day the index finally attenuated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index over its financial day marked almost four percent, but later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the Chinese stock movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Sidney's stock market lost more than five percent, but in the end, losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary dropped to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said Hong Kong Currency Office Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without the dependence of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system assistance plan to which $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of actions picked up the biggest fall in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar drop in volume was recorded for the last time in 1987.
The index went down already before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
The Congress is Retired: The U.S. Government Can Inject 700 billion Dollars into the Bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a comprehensive pact for financial assistance to the American finance system.
The vote will take place early next week.
American legislators led to a gap in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune certain details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told Reuters Agency, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Services Committee and the Assembly Bank.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disenchantment" will be reached thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We resolved our discrepant views on the way the market stabilization package should take place," Democratic Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg agency.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial enterprises to severe losses and threaten system-wide stability.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has an impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to get Congress to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first hour and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when they will vote for the two chambers of the American Congress and, not even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote for the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
The president of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the program's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a closure that alleviates the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the programme, and set up a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This one should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly liabilities of the debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the head economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for sharing the losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give them their good approval as soon as they can.
This important and psychological agreement that such approval should be reached is, at the moment, the most important one," Marek insisted.
Armed Hand Fight: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile player plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to just buy the phone.
There are still sufficient grounds for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the way in which it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult to acquire the most modern record player to listen to him on the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP discs no longer come out, and with regard to their quality there is no single objective reason to continue to understand them.
If vinyl discs with rock, jazz or blues music are stuck in their shelves, I'm probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on its way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a breeder, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly prove the merchant helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, of which there is enough space for each.
The election is wide.
Also decides on the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and even can navigate.
And when we take into consideration Smartphone and PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle as no fridge can make a barbecue and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile the screen indicator will be illuminated before you ask to be recharged.
And the playback of music is one of the biggest energy strokes.
Few are the mobiles who can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, consider that cheap phones will not reproduce more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they constantly call themselves still, for safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst endures at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only one part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some non-reduction drive readers can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobile phones.
For players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to use, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a concrete equipment interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you're going to listen to it every day just a little while, like on the tram, then it's enough for any mobile player to play.
What practically gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and with the exception of it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also enable, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or an album.
This service could alone be an argument of weight to acquire a music mobile.
Regrettably, the supply of operators is miserable and the majority are limited only to the subjects of fleeting success of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that this very way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always carry your headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile phone even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest costs usually less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be constrained by the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them any person.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current caskets or also to the record players is evident.
It does not pose a threat to the fact that we mistakenly connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, huge data loss counts.
For which device to decide
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g., the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach the two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
The basic models are usually only equipped with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding lovers of music hand in hand with the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles on the Walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the above mentioned brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long to get there.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed it by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that a paradoxical situation will be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, also said that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a remarkable drop in prices to which classical operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the UK market, similar voices were heard here and there.
It has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be successful.
In other words, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we inform you about the debut of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Just after half a year, this operator got more than 100,000 customers and became the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, following Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more target groups.
In addition, in order for them to work effectively, it is enough for many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators usually profile with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, are often countered with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half the cheap with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a no trivial goal group.
This operator is addressed specifically to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator he likes and who he can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works on this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether it seems like a concept like that of Poland could hook up in our country.
He doubts Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be a virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem too hopeful.
Rather it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," said mobile phone conversation, Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group Penta.
Indirectly, he assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not leaning on this idea.
Rather, they try to do their best to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to make progress in the meetings," said the group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Then, maybe they'll spark better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At present we believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with O2's opinion, adds: "Until today we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
He adds: "In the network of T-Mobile it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some specific contract that could be studied on such short horizons."
Vodafone is more concerned with meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
Precisely we consider it as the greatest contribution from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is found in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with the operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thus a decline in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon came up.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by T-Mobile society.
It attests to the accessible public information on the ČTU website.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, it was not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Litigations (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders was more than interesting enough for classical operators," he added to our question Kristián Chalupa, from the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For offices that should represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that, they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators work normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the lower prices of mobile phone services"
Of course, the pressure on market media to function properly and lower prices do not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
The dramatic shock in all of this lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore have a corresponding rise in their market share of responsibility.
The tools needed to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, lack, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú whereby telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial bidding a single market.
In this type of market, of course none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must be necessarily dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are soaringly ascending.
Current complaints from stakeholders (indicted by GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which ÚOHS washes hands in all this matter.
We have already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act for the extension of ČTÚ's competition in the field of commercial tenders was tabled recently, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one watches.
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists on Czech mobile networks is unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile services which, however, only part of them are public.
They are usually companies that engage in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally, only a few of those elected get the list of prices for these companies.
The magic is in that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same by loading a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions in all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit such a resale.
"If cases such as those quoted above were discovered, there could be talk of breach of contract conditions that could result in the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová answered the question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned can come to be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they obtain a not negligible profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a disparaging so much as a percentage of customers.
These, moreover, must accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of operators."
Precisely this is what it should look like to ČTÚ minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile phone operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this history and that its trading conditions do not permit it.
When we stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves more or less from this failure.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the more advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened, and in none of the cases they have defended the operators but their customers.
Either with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to get the first virtual operator to appear and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Organ of Regulation all of this happens as if it were a burning nail.
By our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the powers in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this information between backstage is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators allow any virtual mobile phone operator to enter, it will be difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the Anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are available four versions - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and another with female voice, another with Choir and another instrumental.
The singing is done by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir that were set in the dictionary so that the text could be well understood, so that it could be consonant," he commented.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in the year 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made her own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date when the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at the moment by almost 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card in the info centers and posts of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can be bought from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket sales positions at subway stations, where until now they have to regularly queue to get a regular ticket out.
The bonus is purchased on the internet, and the Opencard card is recharged to you in one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with the purchase on the internet and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said the project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard on the vending machines found in some subway vestibules.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, remind us of a banknote pickup machine and travelers will probably have already set themselves at the stations of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start to work tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter into it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only into it.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the circular trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of central Bohemian towns.
"On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization that establishes the timetables of the collective transport of Prague.
Circulation buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's locker.
Upon entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Fund.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on buses and do not remember when the validity of the bonus is finished can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be presented with the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
In 1945, the German Southeasts called for Smoking to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the South Bohemia Scientific Library collection.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
This desire was presumably directed by certain groups of Germans from the Southeast to the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the cards that are stored in a particular file and that are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American President not to allow the return of the " Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want its word that American units are reaching German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
In view of the fact that Czechoslovakia's union with the south-east Germans presumably implies - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American President who assumes today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President presumably doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with our current knowledge of post-war history, can sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists aptly paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of that time.
Although the Czech Germans should have minimally guessed that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Southeast some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When the British seized him at the end of the war and placed him in the camp of prisoners of Holstein tens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would do them good," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, were told that on the basis of the Goods Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday.
The minister's office, Aleš Žebíček promises to deter drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and in leaflets.
I'd have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind you that before you start, the belts are tied.
He wants to reach the awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in ads?
Essentially human stories that embrace emotions.
And to this end, the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign testify to us:
You don't think - pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with great letters on the license plate.
And in a puddle of blood is the word "papas".
This should symbolize that man at a time of dispensation can get to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whipping for drivers
"For drivers the system of sugar and whipping is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the transportation psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publicity, concretes the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in return for peace
The president of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, pronounced on the restitution of practically all lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all (occupied) lands if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll be left with a little bit of this land, but we Palestinians will have to give them a similar percent (of Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over their legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where there were several dead and tens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple hill, a sacred and historical place" found inside the old city.
"He who wishes to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highs, which from its point of view is an inherent condition for the closure of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they'll have to get out of there to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hizbullah (Chitha movement), they must disengage from the continuing support that causes Hamas terrorism (Chitha movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are Zaffets on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long bus
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, we are asked whether the paddies and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted strictly and formally to comply with the law, the activity of the saffate is opposed to the road traffic law," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which last week the two-year-old saffron died, evidently was caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having two other sites booked.
However, the bus may have an accident or slow down suddenly, and at the exact time the saffate distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the paper is if the bus is equipped, according to technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to go standing, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us.
Azaphata does not know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the zaffate - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term "Revisor of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less often, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law addresses this problem sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have places on foot.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided among urbans, where there are places to stand and at maximum speed, interurbans with places to stand with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with a seat belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s Transport Safety Expert, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with regard to the movement of the saffron on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much danger threat, the situation can be compared with service on planes.
Not even here is there a certainty that the turbulence will arrive and that the saffron can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly slows down the physical laws are obviously valid.
Same thing as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the saffron must solve it the internal regulation of the carrier", he says and he also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier who offers the services of zaffodiacs.
It employs 200 people in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers this work risky.
"However, when you have the impression that the saffron post is risky, then I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, on the way in.
It would save even expenses," she says.
In the interest of safety is the reason that Asiana lacks zaffets in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have saffrons, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has happened
In the accident at the line joining Naples died a young woman from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the bus. without using the intermitters.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he clashed with the right-hand front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the saffron were sold.
"These sites can't be booked for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the girl's family but waits for the financial expenses also for the guilty party.
Reforming the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring a greater precision on the movement of the zaffodiac on the bus in which thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
The buses are not too busy, but rather the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the zaffodiacs to be an important threat to the safety of passengers", ending the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety in buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Board of Directors for its employees, there is no shortage of words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group can be formed, as the writing says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the `competition block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter this business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the federal institute for monitoring financial services, which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a while now, also from Frankfurt, there has been a lot of talk about the connection of such a type between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
Indeed, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presented the data after a half year at the end of August, let him know that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to begin negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation seemed so at a time that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and with the Helaba bank.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank began dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of this, it seems more clear that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliamentary elections are to be held, the BayernLB's union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack partners to accomplish that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has been much better than the financial crisis that the properties of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, there is only the North LB left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the whole bank
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with DEKA, that will show time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth.
But this time, he sees Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre Kaiser brand beer barrel is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that bass sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the car park next to Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 there are three buses, ` direction Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly intended for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking next to their flag are singing South Americans, they had already begun to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and silver-colored spectacles, is owned by these buses.
For five years they have come to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the return.
To spend the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need the forces.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the 8 motorway just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group is expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the car park next to Teresa's Prado, there are already about 50 other buses all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowing how to travel.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means marching!", Mark screams in the morning.
"Go!" march and occupy the back places in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the places in front, because we're going to block, and all of you with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, spread all over space!"
One liter of beer, Marco roar, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of your way, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" You understand?
And now everyone goes to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, to the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
It is wanted to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 attendances) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the real estate mortgage
The German banking system is relatively stable, only last week the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück stressed.
Well, the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that German banking will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich real estate finance, which is listed in the DAX index, receives a loan of 1 billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: the credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
The share of the capital that the real estate mortgage will use has to cast interest.
The money comes as from private banks also from public law.
The cause of this is the depfa branch's losses.
According to one report, state financials with the money that was provided for long-term projects financed them only a short period - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the bank's capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income from financial investment and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some securities also from the dissolution of provisions of credit business tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and large revenues of the reimbursements of the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and to the businesses organized for the consortium companies, could the negative balance accuse a deficit with about 16 per cent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state finance at first was lost in speculations with industrial loans for buildings, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aarel bank.
As much money could not be made through the financing of State projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as States (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the real estate mortgage has to perform amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of group losses and profits, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By the year 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Real Estate Hypo became an important state and financial finance in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits was essentially down because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the real estate mortgage needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa credit portfolio of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the report of the real estate mortgage, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group's funding for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially not fit to function"
Other sources say that through this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Board of Directors of the real estate mortgage, explained that the real estate mortgage group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal financial services monitoring institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamic and imponderability of the crisis there is no constancy.
It is even imaginable that funding should not be needed in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be ruled out.
It was voiced that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation can not reassure at least concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts do not nearly change, loan courses according to the position in the property registry clearly tend to decline.
Affected are mainly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth in the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the real estate mortgage, the present value of its loans that were formerly an investment for speculation must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can be derived from the amortisation of pensions within the time frame.
Or something is going to happen, which does not risk imagining anyone - the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-referencing news about partial statization, now the security that is already on its edge became a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because the creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors are still able to put the end point and use the new account transport of the losses for future income tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls began to laugh: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows Mangas' word - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"First day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go on a 40-minute train to Tachibana Highschool.
I only had to find the way, fortunately I didn't miss it.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as strictly as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks very willingly in the public, especially in the face of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of the mother of my host family and besides a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have knifed, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, pretty"
Then I quickly slid off to my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation they all pulled out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that boring pieces of German bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and something like mass tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I'm like here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, candies are not just a luncheon.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a benet made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to her in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read about in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here, too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year at school.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to understand comics and culture better, one day I started to study a little bit of Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a weakness by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the neurology scientist is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, acting in the way similar to us, feel the same?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" the contributions of famous scientists have been published for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown domain because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as other animals: it is made dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, and some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that lead behavior).
This wide part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, among them knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even when consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as necessary, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of the consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated regardless of their contents, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential goes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what happens to sensations like that?
I owe it to the fact that the emotional system activates a part of the brain that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From a linguistic point of view, they follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and brain stem, the same thing Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons, I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels like this in two cases too: But how can you control whether rats and men acting similarly feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, why is he afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of behavior does not yet prove the likeness of experience.
That is true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the trunk of the brain responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to prove it to men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats that emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and to language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as it is measured by rats and men.
Because I don't investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my nostrils, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's championship along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is a lot to do."
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is astounded.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to do work with great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the administration of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platinum that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many first division clubs were convicted due to handling downhill to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, she was talking in an interview about private life, and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband an adulter.
He gets angry and he goes back.
The late two rose war on Meg Ryan's ex-paraja and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new movie "The Women" - tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version," said 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News."
Among other things, it is very "sorry" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is newly married and recently is a twin dad.
And so he ends up with his statements highlighting: "Whether my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Air and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008 plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and overnight stays in hotels were made cheap again - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it has found a big change in the second half.
After for many years the prices on the hotel market continued to rise, overnight stays in many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 percent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of American tourists in travelling decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels increased to 26.3 percent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to increased kerosene prices, travellers of the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even made more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of air tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Business Class and the First Class were small.
In Germany, price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half of the year they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights to Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on one side the rise in the loose economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty that liberalizes the traffic of aircraft between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussia’s Luhukay doesn’t go out to make the top goal yet.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national Marko Martin selection.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
Everything he meant to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance to Hamburg Stadium.
I did not pass anything special in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were again on their sites.
Rieger was almost for three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys a great reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's principal coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcell Jansen added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have him "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said summarizing.
This Monday, the SV of Hamburg will be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to play it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the sail of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The chip with its late obligated players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goler Petric as well as Jansen who was taken from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the chip cannot shine with its successes.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bank rescue package dropped a certain period down to 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points during a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
About 20:30 one of the world's most important bag barometers rated a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stood at 1548 points.
At the moment the biggest loser on the Dow Jones was American Express who lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan provides for the provision of resources to buy so-called "lost" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid by blow but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the option receipts of shares for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cash.
Action courses in Europe and in the USA continue to decline
The aid of one billion for banks in Europe and the USA does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate lows and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative actions of the real estate mortgage and the commercial bank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and the private banks, the action of Munich’s property finance a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street in New York began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it remained at 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the draft salvation, the vote in the Senate may be the first of October.

In addition, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that participations in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the researchers to be puzzled: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
The experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The Ulysses space probe spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to maneuvering, provokes the disconcerting among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver in the trajectory of space probes during which they gain acceleration using the gravitational field energy of a planet, e.g. from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave for 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they experience speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it abnormality during gravitational assist in maneuvering.
Experts fear that even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space, may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and try to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be Dark Matter which can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudan's kidnappers had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back on the point of attention of the kidnappers.
Welt ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently released.
On this the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija TV station and the Italian media.
After the news of the release on the Italian radio station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your state of health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the guard said.
It was just to "receive the hostages" when suddenly came "this surprise".
On Sunday, six kidnappers have been killed by Sudanese soldiers and two have been arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather "bringed to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight indecent assault charges.
The Truro Royal Court, through an inquiring study, knew that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her house in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to life in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, Attorney Ramsey Quaife told the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about her, that after she had been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "done to life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been an amazing experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends up with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she had not done so, probably the matter would not have ended in the courts."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a job trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
Documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to delinquency.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police on account of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his house to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the rescue/save of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government provided 14 trillion pounds sterling to protect deposits of 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interests that become in the interim are assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to GBP 450,000 in 2009.
This implies that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association Comercial de las Sociedads de Construcción, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members in front of what could be a relevant price," said Mr. Cole.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutual-building companies and not having shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
The people on the Jersey side will have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence the litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and then the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The most recent increase in the price of milk by February was 2002.
Denial of bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail, accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the several charges of corruption against you.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, supported militarily, first grant him full freedom.
The correspondents say that as long as he is given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of his release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she could not obtain bail because she was already being treated abroad under parole," said counsel Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, as reported by an Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - the UN says - have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that it happened despite the pledges made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision forcing the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9% on ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation had doubts about ITV's independence, and it encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have handed over its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of management officials.
The report criticized officials of the White House, legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Several allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine US lawyers were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was known that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that layoffs would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of Republicans, high profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, resigned his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and stresses that he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epic of Much Honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special prize next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group is running the nominations for this year's prizes and making the ranking of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal skills such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained in the rankings for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation due to her cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced her to cancel some concerts.
Subsequently it appeared that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the Primary Calle – before I found the Second Calle – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This narrow street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty street more than an active road.
There's no sign.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings in the Calle Town Hall
that wants to refurbish Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old date neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the past block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee on Land Use, which took place this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community said.
"The city is the owner today of very few spaces and we would like it to continue to possess Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, she didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sales proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire for the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop ownership rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more color surroundings, Bowery's, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when the large property owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment coming out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"He was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, billboards, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the bourgeoisie of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, almost unchanged, a strip of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made part of a talk in the history of the city about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and unreachable alley, also dark for the day and marked by rusty and counter-ventana iron warehouse doors, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed about the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door which was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said that they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that you could give it a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humid, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
Barack Obama's educational proposals are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for students-English.
However, the open question for Mr.Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers teaching in classrooms in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
more than a third of the students, many of whom are newly arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant competency assessment and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr.Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to English instruction to students is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this last one who has arrived from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of their party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "You must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The shares of crude oil decreased by 7% to $99.80 a barrel in the morning negotiation in the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back again because of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety seized the investors, once again on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the greatest in history.
The news was shattered by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachova Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, on the frenetic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem to have been unable to reactivate the market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rate will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this infection.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as oil consumption down due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw how things unfolded in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a match without notation into a game of disinflation.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played slothfully under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles achieving a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect presage for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of them when one cornerback fell and another one arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people might think."
While Favre and Coles were in the prison, the defense of the Cardinals mistreated the quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, Bowens' faults might have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a definitive 34-0.
These are the biggest points the Jets never made in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second room much more than the third.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselasie rested head his world record
Once again, Ethiopian Haile Gebrselasie has shown that many consider her the greatest runner in history, overcoming her own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the accommodating flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselasie destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established world record number 26 in an impressive race length so it has established a world championship or world record for any distance, from the counter clock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate her problems with asthma.
Instead, he aimed for running in Berlin.
Under practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselasie won this Sunday, employing on average a cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since the track runners like Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselasie told the journalists that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks before and that he had lost a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselasie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the object of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the competition sense.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebrselasie as a runner.
On Sunday, at the four Kenyans march, Gebrselasie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselasie after their pacemaker decreased.
But just before three miles from the finish, Gebrselasie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She didn't take part in the Beijing Games either, so she was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes at the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a Kenyan and Ethiopian runner quartet head-on and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Eatonville fair to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what is going to be lost."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said 59-year-old Jones Hortense, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a double level of poverty of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes disdained, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It is not surprising, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left," he wrote, "there's the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and everything goes with transitory rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without notice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," followed Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer printed.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The officials of Orange County wanted to put a five lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two lane street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, inter alia, had put an end to it relatively idyllic community isolation.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl once, too.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
A Residents say today that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the trust of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the night," N.Y. Natiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization said.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because she was white - there's a cultural gap there," Natiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with boycott, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was back under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The risen idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Natiri.
Ms. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a refurbished and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
The outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's story, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A An early permit is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - like the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as she saw her entire race: beauty, and all problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It's a sincere civic sense that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey who is planning to return to Eatonville after university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nest offices that are above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Guys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal baskets for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue dragging between buildings of charged apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 embezzled eccentric shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to carry from morning, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait for their bagel queued to the sellers' carts, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me like there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm in my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers all their life order their checkbook, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's department store and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personally trusted banker," and were in line for the same reason as I.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from where they had been commuted, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little like a building company), credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and who say they treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed for their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachow, with $440 billion of savings deposits, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank which is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become finance experts in the last few weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her afflicted executive director, Dick Furd, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lynn, fifty-one and some concierge in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shop-in-house.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The commutation is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Desecrated Muslim tombs at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the tombs, but researchers think this may have happened because of the attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which reached Muslim religious when the month of Ramadan was over.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headbands and the burkas, and also expressed his opposition to food considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter ' s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as they did to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad under the registration of sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to notify the police of the planned seven days in advance of departure.
The Kent police said it would not discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
A police spokesman from Kent said: "The Kent police will do their utmost to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A police spokesman from Kent said: "The Kent police will do their utmost to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court in west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and delighted to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master outside the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No tacones, no flying clothes, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great flamenco masters, stripped of the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they are not going to go out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the flamenco photography month programming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, as he sees the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting in a scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began a long journey in 1.997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical base of the image, conferring on it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essentials, with the duel that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portart project".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-People", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, know them and be able to enter an instant into their lives, whether a long or short instant.
I think inside the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself or you face people, characters, you sometimes don't know, or they leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Galeria El Photomata, located on the 20th street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda of Hercules, where it can be visited until the 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set up in places that still do not know and see unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were wise, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to end it once," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he's seen passing through the city of Acueducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the shelter of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him an audience handed over to him who was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great amounts of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "please to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manera" to supple his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and remaking much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more unconforming", so he asked the writers "not to abandon frivolity" and "to assume with responsibility" his vocation.
Climatology lessens the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of areas
The holiday of areas that closed the farm's subscription to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the advertised rejuners that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Meteorological inclemencies have been ceded with this fair, as two of its three festivities have not finally been celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
The poster consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco.
So, only Friday was a celebration.
In him, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went to his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talvante sailed his two stables with greetings and an ear, which gave more tendons than his toe.
That's right, even worse was El Juli, who went through Los Llanos's body without grief or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief work, a large part of the audience was beaten.
You skip a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hash
Five minus ten in the morning.
Control of traffic of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Arminón, Álava.
The officers give up the two occupants of a van and they take the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not as if to stop.
The officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., as reported in a statement by the Basque Government's Interior Department.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control in the N-1, at its passage through the municipal term of Arminón.
They were ready to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, speeded up abruptly and the control was over.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the archen, at which time their two occupants hurried to flee the race through a forested area.
The ertzaines finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of shawl they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with beams of hashish, so they moved to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the truck's documentation, so the arrested person had also been charged with a criminal offence of forgery of a public document.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the provenance of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., aged 28, was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant proceedings and will be available for trial within the next few hours.
Stop the actress Heather Locklear by driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers trying to get out of her car park in Montecito, according to a spokesman for California's highway patrol, People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deep the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the car park forward and backward, and on going back passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had apparently not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"It looked disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was shown cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a driving suspect under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison over 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian UI federation to assume its competences in the Silva case
The IU general coordinator and Izquierda Unida deputy, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was charged with dealing favorably with family members.
"I for these things am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares on the performance that the party will have to adopt with which until now a councilor in the Seville Consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always argued that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency."
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Sangre in May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the front of a wide list of interpreters.
Sangre de Mayo, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, opens this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of the 2nd of May Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Madrid Community has provided for Garci as a whole constitutes a "one-time opportunity" to set up the portrait of "an all-rounded Spain which was wrong to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not have funding such as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice as much as that of Sangre in May- so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Return to Start, has affected in which is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with which he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and to those who do not casting, for he seems "humiliating" and considers that "part of the director's job lies in attending the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre of May repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
As an Oscar candidate on four occasions - of which he won one-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, the Sangre himself of May, seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to come to know", he said.
With this film, Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're content with making one more movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillen dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillen dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when he was three years old he moved to London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free women's movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of interwar, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we intend not to tell her life but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterflies' dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake's dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in that of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the greatest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The montage also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song by Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas throughout their extension, and who are always in love with them".
In the work there is also somehow the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she habitually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less value their work," says Bayón.
The show will open today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencado" in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Assembly of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Acopo de Luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No malice," and gives the idea of the defeat of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
Look what it took to give her an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
It's still been a deck for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
No one was afraid to make it ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of film and country had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without virtue of men and very few beings to admire you, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
Incarnate for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and champion of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of his firstborn killed by overdose to his brand of home and organic food.
A whole gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood barry admiration without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig, found that not a man but an era has died.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no less than the summit of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us the bar very high to all," noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the requirement of probity and to have a serious and distant private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He got divorced once, but then he was married 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he was surely left with the chances of not being married.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?", he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he interpreted, none was as proud as that of a devout husband, father lover, father-in-law and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there will be Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my opinion it's been the worst race I've ever been in.
A pile of misappropriations that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I would examine, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The misappropriations begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if they already make you go give it everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Not at all.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first down, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the T-shirt (second down, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a little bit compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain softened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which joined with contos of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think that about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the ranking, because of the chip that they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect career, this one wouldn't get into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about an Olympic city well-prepared.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move around the company campus) responding to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells him she'll be with you shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked a lot above a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is thanks.
Microsphoto is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is the necessary layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is only booted to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time navigating than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications coming in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post I took her in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
In the refresher machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66 per cent of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, was also confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but in the end, rather by dropping to 2010.
Microsoft will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is increasingly computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio read one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', the same as Al Pacino in 'The Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the Musculated Gay Parish.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that pointed moustache fork raising weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's just the typical men's underwear in cotton, ash and no sleeves.
The 'tank', which is called the English speakers, but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles points out about all the others.
First of all, by its rimombante name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it receives its name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'The Marcel' stands out over others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (recognizable only) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babysitting, mini shorts...
Handcuffs designed for underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cross sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango is making at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house esponsoriza.
Warm and timid, win in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have created my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new season autumn-winter, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection based on for Mango this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything unites and has a lot of common ties.
As a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to sneak into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of myself.
You know that we dancers really like to do our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you really find the character.
So everything is united, that's yes, with much respect for designers and professionalism.
You didn't make it by 30, did you get a crisis?
It's okay.
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a little girl and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me and I also want to be a young mom; this I don't want to miss.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're pending several openings you shot last year.
That's right, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, all I want for now and of course, cannot be.
I look forward to the opening of 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the Tomb of Christ'.
See how they look...
A few days ago you started on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up to a gateway to model.
Simply, I was called Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite myself to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender Naomi heart.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part where she gets involved.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to do the pin, so too.
For benefiting women in the third world, whatever it takes.
Alcoholic reoccurring drivers must install 'alcock'
Inside wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting the drunk vehicle, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney-General's Office, which states that it is a one-year pilot project.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so it will also receive a course of road re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General's Office of Segurida Vial, the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists reported more than once for driving drunks again catch the car.
The alcoholic would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected it is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and it would run on behalf of the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce the infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implantation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people each year.
The measure relates to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal procedure requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been piloted in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The Congress of Deputies will be voting tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40, at the United Kingdom time, the scheduled time of the program was to land at the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez airport in Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use your hand in a visor mode to see the real couple come down from the plane.
On foot by stairwell, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
He had asked the taxi driver about the street earlier if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, swollen to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF she threatened storm.
They give a smile and a clear stop to the photographers before they move into the room where the official party awaits.
On the doorstep of the hotel where they stay, one of the four large in the city, awaits a Mexican television reporter.
The best prize endowed with fashion
There may not be a place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there will not be a more exquisite live designer and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is equipped with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in Mango's shop in Boulevard Haussmann's 54th in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, ended up at a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the close proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, was still more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken with sorrow and making heart guts, for his brother's recent death, put on a suit of the House and some ELAH's dressings, which cut his breath, and his son Luis's arm - a canyon of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, beside the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because they were both lent to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the shop with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for dinner she turned into a sexy black dress, got excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a 'big plie' mask.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk for the palace's dependencies, but before he taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously ordered, that there would be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number of stress
There is not 1000 but 1000 more a way to forget chaotic and frantic daily life.
And in case it was little, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine itself wrapped in the agitated pace that modern life imposes.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number goes up to, nothing but 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a menu of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores in the hand of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' disclaims such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very cleverly telling us something that has happened the day before, but to children who speak sleeping.
The first time it happens to the best time you get scared, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called drowsiness.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one have been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadic (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once weekly, once in monthsS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (make sleep pee) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be like that.
As mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's an understudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a tone of quiet voice, loose words, a murmur or otherwise (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense it would be useful to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to see if there is any question that is generating much anxiety and gives him leave in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it does not have treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or shows that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children and having a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will encourage the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the dreams come out try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the usual thing), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to sound him information.
You won't get anything, because being asleep is not conscious of how to organize your thinking.
Besides you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which you are very careful how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many occasions of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to brush the squad with a long shot, Illhaeusern nearly took the "power" and by turn founderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we wouldn't let the camp center pass and we'd just leave Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second period was crucial, first with two occasions of Riahi and Temporal goal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the rejected ball in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the goler Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousiens who went back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last few seconds of play during which, after an important butterfly, the ball passed very close to the cross-country.
Sarkozy finds the furious fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a roundabout for Britain.
In front of the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find its representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures to increase the prices of diesel oil, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseus spokesman David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
Fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to slow circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused almost 10 km of traffic.
Quiberon's marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-isle have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed on Monday their determination burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the oxs stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total Refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the National Committee for Fisheries, which did not hold up their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris " , announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel fuel at a price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and One Destiny " has died from cancer at 83 years of age at home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at 83 years old.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession in the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivery apparatuses, reconfirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been taken out of trouble by the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this journal needs.
AIG's board met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its airline leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan which the Federal Reserve at risk from seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, thus diluting it with the proper proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historical fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen in the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index dropped from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, i.e. the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, a technological dominant index, went back to 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded index(extended) Standard & Poor's 500 to 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the definitive figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied the Secretary of the US Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would be "too late."
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the relief (the American central bank, the N. de la Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten the conditions of credit," said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance of Global Insight.
And further stressing the sense of urgency, " every passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, stressed Mrs. Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachow's banking activities by his rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, resulting in emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market went up drastically.
The 10-year yield of the treasury bond decreased by 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond to 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the eve.
Obama, winner during the first TV duel
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, another happened to know who won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No surprise, the Republican and Democratic Campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "too "bright" to allow him to slow down in the polls five weeks after the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives five points of advantage to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), believes it is the Democrat who came out well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them grant McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It has good instincts," I nevertheless warn Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining his adversary's "ingenuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
Senator Obama did not seem to understand that he accused him several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disconcerting himself, he was concise and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, has already done so," he said this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans.
" During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had met for an election meeting in North Carolina in a rainy rain.
He did not utter the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most able character to save the economy that is on the brink of precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode," yesterday I estimated the influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton ' s during the financial crisis in 1998.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would come in spite of all to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45-station nuclear power plant by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates avoided issues related to the $700 billion plan of financial relief (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: " the dictator, he must resign " .
Some recognize not having voted: "for what, since they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made foreign observers good in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been put next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Question the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to the parliament, those who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating his 10th anniversary yesterday of his foundation, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has been once again one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that had seriously been vacillated by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and the discontent of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gelineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec started his activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, he recalls Decary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence, " he says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in the successive Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary recalls, however, that "confidence is something extremely fragile."
Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle since its inception on 28 September 1998.
At that time, we were in Europe at the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports by Krever and Gelineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied had no meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests allowing the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not antibodies against the virus, which were based on the tests used so far.
Nucleid acid tests allowed for shortening the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, more than 24 years will pass before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I think you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without any worries," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Island of the Meeting, which, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant ", Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec should also provide for sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Because more aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet injection.
Ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which regroups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria, however, may give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people proposing their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood, "it afflicts Francine Decary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench of our thousandth blood sample from the umbilical cord and it is expected to draw more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this cordon blood-taking program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this ", since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - Impact on semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a win by 3-1 (4-3 in fine summary) at the coast of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Campgroundist Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, the midfielder David Texto and Rocco Plancentino created many opportunities for a goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who tore Matt Jordan apart from the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first match of the match series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle's suburb.
The impact will be measured at the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the match back to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps still agreed in the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced at Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – The Victory Goal of Kovalev
The number three Canadian is willing to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn facilitated the 3-2 Canadian win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor quarter in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the fullest in the first time, wrote Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the launch of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the boundaries of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the electoral period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, a partnership between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the parallel 49th - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel in immense potential " , but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydropower, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "territorial twice large as France", "is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he requested a national founding myth.
Quebec was built very much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the golden river in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, " with climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North " , he stated about the passage from the north-west, which will open every year due to the melting of the ices.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec Party of Ungava), have already started consultations close to about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concluded, orderly and environmentally friendly " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new occasions of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-name Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another conservative reference, John Diefenbaker's Roads to the North program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," he told his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a Federation Council mission in China and a Quebec-New York York Summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems with being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that was made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Lyrics - A dishonorable country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in Cabinet Harper, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "happiness" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who carried an unceasing fight for justice and who deserves our full admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminating him occurred.
The only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who fights with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter to you that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of stress.
We still do not realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has already come when no morals exist more: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world attempted a defamation process of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the mine's almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will dampen the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to re-examine the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was enough, therefore, for the mining company to open its books, files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate by despising his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it mainly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not on what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (following the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada intimidating them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on university freedom and freedom of truth, essential for all democratic societies.
He denied the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on the facts and interpretations, which represented the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not feel like making a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollars plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control on the part of the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new arrangements to contain the number of stalled houses the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over wages paid to the leaders of the aided companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions about the daily lives of Americans will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who were late in the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, but did not forget to express their discontent with being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been given certain arrangements to reach the agreement, particularly that would allow owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of the leaders of state-owned companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it."
"The important points that I have read [show] is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable."
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with the taxpayers' money the doubtful debts, the riskable and unsoldable assets of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to cause a freezing of liquidity and a ban on banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have emerged from the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of cutting the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take up losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to be added 100 other billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In return for its aid, Washington will obtain shares in the aided companies which will be worth dividends in case of profits and which will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures relating to housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all its efforts, it is not yet sure that its plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber finance commission, told his constituents that " with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand ".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not that which consists in profiting from the taxpayers."
The Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging a small group in Congress, presents the problems in another way, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: we asked Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was refusing to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost €2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) during the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that the savers and families will now appreciate that the times are uncertain. "
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and over 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their modesty, their sensibility and a talent that was evident will also have removed them from the register of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, as a Jewish German father and mother of Hungarian origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, last quality mark.
Because in it there was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatants of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot who was ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honorable man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the film-makers this weekend, while his great roles are intertwined into the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual movement parades through it.
Many memories return to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we call upon your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not meet all your promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of cinema.
This Rocky Graziano boxer, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice manor in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Ages change during his career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on unorthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as godfather of the Irish Mafia on Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was curled.
Contrary to several legends of the cinema that soon abandoned the race, Newman stayed a lot in the world of the cinema, denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge living in " underplaying " and judging his over-supported performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he interpreted less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As director, Newman revealed sideways his true public sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former mate Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: " my life and my country were better because of their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against the excesses of Hollywood is also hiding.
We will have seen a great deal of his face reign over the pots of vinegar sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although he began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters with a letter that contained these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuchlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the funds obtained from public competitions were used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in their entirety some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private people.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public competitions with false invoices after which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the accusation, most invoices were false.
For this they obtained the heelmen in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice should be carried out was decided among others on that tour by the Balathon Superior Region where János Zuchlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices he presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Council.
Most of these invoices were signed by István Lados and his accomplice András - who, according to our information, wrote the reports needed to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuchlag and its accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the centre manager - so many people do not fit both in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet on the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the big fancied invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed out to the Pigal Kft food centre, because in the holding of books of the same one - according to the information given to the prosecution - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he knew that they were false documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill there were a hundred people, since they have only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, meals were also included in the invoice, while the restaurant has long since not worked.
In addition, the enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they signaled as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - VAT was also included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 per cent VAT, in addition the employees of the hotel only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
Moreover, the "consignors" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Equally by formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it is known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
The counterfeiters also paid no attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyiregyháza was in liquidation, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
Bills have been sent out consciously
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are made up of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, issued an invoice amounting to some four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - convinced him one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuchlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices for approximately five million HUFs to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, Atlas Egyesület association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to record in their documents to this entity.
The following group of fake invoice manufacturers include those who have any connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL manager with a fictitious seat in Budapest, who was involved in the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of software.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation which he shipped on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlas, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the defendant, they did not receive work.
But it profited from these companies, since, at the request of his accomplice, counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuchlag: for the Atlas and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even took advantage of society in Szi-Beri comandita to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500,000 HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
In order not to be discovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the defendants will probably report in the trial - as they did in the prosecution - the course of the falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the own main defendant János Zuchlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and yet repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what interest do you have in doing so?For perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists have come to an agreement with him so that Zusa takes all responsibility.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could be offended, since in order to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied to him.
While the many perpetrators of far superior economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least wait for the sentence in their own home, he has no chance of doing so.
Overlay psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and, in the meantime, was examined through the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (FMRI) the active areas of the brain of the individuals participating in the experiment.
In both games they could earn money the participants , but during auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto prize" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members gambled.
In addition to this, another group was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the auction phenomena only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world, some 5 billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
An estimated 100,000 people are infected in this country, but only 7,000 are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are propagated by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body humors (sperm, vaginal mood, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be protected by A and B vaccine, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, manifests by a general ill state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Every year a million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent slowly destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor by experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the body, thus it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic infections of the liver caused by viruses and to the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
The Oxford University scientists conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - the British Telegraph newspaper reported.
Within the framework of this singular experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same amount of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was found that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first of the research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows: they fixed a glassy instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrat of the 17th century; and the Lady of the Armor of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers were hoping that the Virgin Mary's spectacle would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing religious painting or the other.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their hearts peace reigned."
As they observed the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases of truth change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have for the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown by Madonna de Leonardo or by another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find it both in the people's pocket, and in the sky above your head; you know where your vacations have been, what doctors you visit and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times newspaper that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary in order to be able to meet the original objectives of Google's founders: "Let's gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that it turned to the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to handle all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered this way: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best suit me?" - however, the software won't be able to answer questions apparently as simple as long as there are enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their web browsing, the search keywords, IP addresses, and pages that passed on after the search was completed are precisely stored.
Thanks for example to Customized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened, and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you use my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that not only do they retain, but in justifiable cases they also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google handed to the Brazilian government the information on its website, Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights, in May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, an organisation for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain on the pretext of strengthening the Child Protection Act approved years ago, close to 50,000 Web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life are being damaged when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde incorporation", not so to their rival, Microsoft, catalogued by their Windows as conqueror of the World, as much as they both struggle for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available channels of communication, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which can also have a blog, in which automatically appear the most recent photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases from which it turns out that for example the bride, when seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, she learns with whom she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because she writes her sincere opinion in her blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
A person's "on-line" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of the youth of today.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least tries to dodge Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but doesn't leave any marks).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to avoid being able to find them, but Google's on-line applications can be replaced, from text-editing software to news-reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while services that are increasingly rapidly causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked any information that violated the good morale and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is already ready to work, what if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolutionize the World: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archive books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own comprehensive health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, the popular novel of Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the footprints of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of Ózd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, allegedly grounded, helped erase the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Public Order Commissioner for the province of Borsod.
The young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and are now accused of criminal misconduct.
The two minors - according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - can defend themselves in freedom.
By complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He was charged with the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of an Ózd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was prepared long earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police examine with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which in a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech daily E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by interested parties by the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
The experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments of Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly profound international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - opina La República de Roma - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", the billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it's more correct to talk about a "second September 11th".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the error of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the US monetary system is growing, and this will then have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the vote on the Congress there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
You can't ignore this threat - notes Geneva's Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still pull lifeline belts from the drumming financial institutions, thus being able to save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if more banks are demolished as I do, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to leave aside their nationalist selfishness and to centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming more real.
The EU has so far not been seriously involved in the crisis that goes on as a world leader in the Old Continent .
"Savers" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what case is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart car imitates bee flight
What would be the best method for developing technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of obstacles existing in nature?
For example, that of the beekeepers.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the beekeepers provided the starting point for the Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic car management system BR23C imitator of nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the beekeepers, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each bee creates its own private oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety guard capsule - explained in the exposure Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The eyes composed of the bees play an important role, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle mimicking the movements of the bees, modifies the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any existing system at present, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety guard capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process must be carried out in an opening and closing of the eyes.
However, unlike beekeepers, the movement cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of turning wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for beekeepers to dodge other beekeepers, here they only used rotational motion and acceleration as a possibility for the auto robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and its energy density is greater, which means they have longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is instinctive and intelligent reaction and not data processing capacity, no less storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No memory of gigabytes, no megabytes.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan's calculations, will be able to be incorporated into the standard manufactured models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding existing obstacles on his way.
He's already got a name for this dearest boy.
The written version of the $700 billion bailout law has been prepared, which will be implemented in several phases in order to purchase bad bank credits.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the schedule of the east coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement around the financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the North American Congress, saying that it is only missing to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: this program will work and it will be efficient but further measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of saving Wall Street, but of turning him back into the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8:00 p.m., according to Washington schedule (i.e. before 2:00 p.m. on Monday, according to Central Europe timetable), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the bill called emergency law for economic stabilization in 2008, Monday will first vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this amount, the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, bad rating securities and the destination of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new decision by Congress.
Under the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined approach: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities credit fund values, and other "venomous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or in direct form - competent persons of the ministry were informed.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, to be the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks in trouble and waiting for State aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot calls simply parachutes of gold.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys under a auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the failed bank head jubilates.
By buying the bad credits directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the revenue of directors generals - said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will eventually even be able to obtain profits from the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank recovers.
According to the bill in the next five years, the President will have to make a proposal to Congress on how to return taxpayers to financial sector losses.
Of course, on both sides, there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens, that is, they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars, said the California Republican Congressman, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him to be the same as they are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 prices - the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent compared with those of July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared with those of the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent over the previous month and by 3.2 per cent over the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimum extent, with 0.1 percent.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors increased minimally, with 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The highest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sector (2.8 per cent), primarily due to the monthly increase of 4.6 per cent in bags and belts and a 2.5 per cent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9%), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper manufacturing, publishing and printing.
In the rest of the processing industry, prices increased between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within internal trade, a 0.3 per cent increase was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison - in domestic sales of the processing industry - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2 per cent increase was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry, with a determining weight, there was an 11 per cent increase.
Price decrease was recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6% and 9.1%.

The prices of electricity, gas, heat and water exceeded the prices of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) was recorded in the sectors of investment goods.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, with no change in energy and intermediate sector prices compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, with respect to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods producing branches, a decrease of 6.8 per cent was recorded and in the investment goods 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industry calculated at HUF increased by 1.1 percent over the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The contribution of our national currency in one month was reduced by 1.7 per cent with respect to the euro and by 7.1 per cent with respect to the dollar, compared to August 2007 strengthened by 7.5 per cent with respect to the euro and 15.9 per cent with respect to the dollar.
Will next year no longer need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the entry into force of the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement on 12 January - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, in front of the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion "mostly everything depends on the timely construction on the other side of the Atlantic of the electronic system of access and control."
At the same time, he warned that the entrance premise will disappear in the new system, but tourists must register before leaving the country of origin.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Media Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks' financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major US parties secured on Sunday their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and Administration, following several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced early Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by focusing on economic issues, Obama again gained some advantage and the advantage of McCain that he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice-presidentship disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will rapidly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly (...) you are at risk of employment, saving you, and entire industries and stability of the whole economy," he said to a crowd of 35,000.
He did not take the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that "we're all going to get this thing to a hard time... but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a supervisory commission to the finance minister and the limitation of the executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted daily with the minister.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press magazine of the German speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group they became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
Social Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on him.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that had been anticipated for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the electors of the CSU.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group they became the more conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks, the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have left most of the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have baccalaureate and the graduates.
This reduced support for the CSU to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confused situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, everything now revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let them see some of their fights.
Werner Faymann, the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left behind the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, at the post of vice-cancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offerings.
He said that cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, and France is the host of the European Union, who is also President of the European Union this year.
Mr Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fides, in his message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz Group of Deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies are left out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Gypsies have not finished middle school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can obtain university diplomas."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a crucial role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in teaching Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member of the European Parliament, these issues need to be made widely aware both of the Roma and of non-Gypsies.
For the sooner the school begins a Gypsy student, the more possibilities you will have to become an active member of the labour market; through taxes on income and consumption they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, have to be guaranteed the right to quality education and to ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Livia Járóka.
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the processes of school segregation immediately, which is why it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be offered the possibility that democratic space guarantees so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," said Járóka.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually since the Berlin meeting last year, held in the sign of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failure of Mr Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, the debate on personal issues has not yet been cut off at the summits of the Bavarian CSU.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-called duo gave a glimpse: they did not hold so close to their posts.
They intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who one day after the "Babaro tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, they will undoubtedly have to form a coalition with someone in the future.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group that opens negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Free Right Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition Stoiber will also receive an active role that has so far been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former president of the CSU called on September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 election of the Bundestag, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor unless they are able to enhance together the CSU that played a key role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could hardly hide his disappointment at the failure, CSU's losses will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition Members in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, made up of 100 and 10 deputies, has not been opposed to more than a decade ago, before the election of yesterday's united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some members of the opposition into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Beltransgaz Russia, owner of the pipeline passing by the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give permission to entry to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered anti-democratic.
It was a sign of deterrence when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE Monday's primary report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - declared to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow even one opponent to enter that parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests when it sees the results, but rather tries to send voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that more and more those who support change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increased trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security "is similar to the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing other than the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they set up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But since today it starts with this measure against who gets it and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister says.
"There is now a new season of accountability and transparency.
This is Reformism", stresses again Brunetta.
Palacio Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, the secretary general says: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of part of them".
In short, no more breakfast on working hours; no more coffee and mediums.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 in the morning is a holy hand."

in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences of public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, means 60,000 more people at work in one year."
And it adds that it is necessary to make the public administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double regarding the private sector and well above the rate of inflation".
For now millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of decree Brunetta by adhering to the request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work due to the causes of illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the 'passenger workers' are constantly increasing.
In Italy, millions are actually the right and productive employees of the public administration who have joined to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar replied to the exclusion of aggregated economic treatment due to illness due to service; the extension of the time zones in which visits are made to medical control of the sick employee, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Cerial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
By 2007, data Inail effectively confirmed that white deaths had been approximately 1,200.
Figures testifying to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news from these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalidated by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the continued associative commitment to workplace prevention, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness."
"It has been manifested, a 'bad', sincerely shared, in front of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant are the numerous initiatives promoted at school for a more direct awareness of the young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention of the phenomenon alive, not to halt the alarm on social gravity, to implement and improve legislation.
For his part the president of the House Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to urgently put an end to".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive progress, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli's president.
"We do not really want this "decrease tendency" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - in so far as it concerns the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary care provided for the victims of work" and the "care derivative to which the system is directed in recent years".
"The goal is to return the worker the insurance guarantee - he has added - because the fate of the one who gets injured does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator every time."
MP3 Readers Under Accused, Risk Hearing · Global Voices
Listening to loud music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, in a statement published in Brussels, the opinion of the Scientific Commission for Emerging and Recently Identifyed Health Risk (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day having the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable music devices and high-level mobile phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – follow EU responsibility – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is raising awareness among consumers and making this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion so that they are broadly effective and have the passage with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and interested parties that measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the auditory damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure time.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical devices listen to loud (but 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the limit currently in force on the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the futute of the capital of Rome", which was set up this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the gates were closed in March, the council and the municipal council assessed analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its manager Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to stress German – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council can then move.
There is no strong position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June – the steward announces – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome."
He accuses the Commission of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, German answers: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are manifested around.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and over the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously towards the development of Rome and its future."
The Roman Signor also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and it will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute necessity, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, the steward of Rome needs" was not limited only to the current municipal boundaries but that he looked beyond "not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician interested in passing independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relationships (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
has written a lady from Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he had won the highest position in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and they don't answer the voters' question: will you be a good president? And besides, there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who talks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, in the bowels of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know who the American patriot will vote for.
It goes out on one side of the American mindset covered up to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think of where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if they win Obama, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
1500 people have been asked: what have been Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent have replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Who will assume George W's post will have a huge duty to develop.
Usa, economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is cut-off time. Many blame the Internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
But today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work for the newspaper are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not wanted as understood by the majority of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "murder" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in hope "to do something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with the "security of work".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it's 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third one to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for his admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA IS ESTABLISHED
The president of the second penal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the field of research on the counter pact on the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of his arrest process last week, he obtained his home release, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence he is accused of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the Washington people" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become powerless with the vow of the one who spoke at first.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate are solidifying and coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the refurbishment, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual status-sovereignty category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance those who have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state are compromised much more.
He who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern him: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or lack much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which divides as always between different interests and the different state strategies fails to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of every state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that possesses economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the ever more sophisticated technology network of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with unmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look at you, can certainly be carried from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself sovereign, he certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that, but it presaged a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of disbelief for the existing leaderships, of an outstanding economic species inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to make more and more progress, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far at a height, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the term, having made their own time and being more strange to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement delegitimating the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an "return" election or in sudden changes of collective humours of these past times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say anything, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what they are now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and stirs potentially in dismediation.
Faced with all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walking on walls like Spider Man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a 100-pound body onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American Science magazine has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the legs of the gecos, covered with microscopic hair that can assure the animal a perfect adhesion.
The tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "it easily takes off from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING BY THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Caps to walk through walls exactly like spider man? Caps yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat drivers and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
Another INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also working on the search for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibres like hair that self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mostly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken contemporaryly with some drugs it is altered their absorption amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of apple juice, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The apple juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
FARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being assumed.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by the apple and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drugs that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the drugs that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly» stressed the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Economy novel for Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of Bush administration's decisions on economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack on 11 September 2001, Enron broke you, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A foresight that triggers much controversy and that for several years was blamed for the economy, but it has now proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset about how the scandal of Enron’s and Worldcom’s collapse has quickly disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "great economist", but also a divulger with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the launch of the OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public service professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, whose backs are guarded by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less thick magazine interface, others are added more consistent, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to multi-function with Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic editing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front can be created "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the drafting of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to take some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English in the mirror since Friday.
As well as for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for Linux operating system.
On request can also be sent the installation cd at home or at work.
And if the issue of free can be a hook for home diffusion, it is in business that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already being able to have several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened up.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the written video the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, come in the case of the known Access is the program that consents to work on the data base; and last Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the best score of the climber.
The news is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood champions has been among those carried out in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, supporting the award of the best climber.
INMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy from an emigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants "accommodated with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking for in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also quoted episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation sought by the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the clandestine people is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked that the State and the church work together to combat racism".
Student victims of rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the tenants' union, renting an individual room I could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has totally distorted the market to such a point of triggering a widespread growth process even for residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases rent offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, tax-free contracts, tied rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary which, through the revision of the tax, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fair area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros per bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros per single room.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) they ask you for approximately 600 euros for one single room and 450 for one bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per individual room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It only saves if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 for an individual room in the Prenestina area, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples, you can use a bed of 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, you can use 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for an individual.
in the most girls cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where rents to students and non-EUs are more frequent, there is a subsequent anomaly: an increase of 25/30% in the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city cancels the historic halls
Historical cinematographic halls close favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effective what is happening in the big Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory,"is as if a friend died, a acquaintance who shared a piece of space and so much excitement," notes the director of the new cinema Paradise, the film that twenty years ago I win the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that may have been lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of the merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most of them are the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these three Italian regions are themselves that have recorded the largest number of new meticos cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is ethically and morally embarrassing that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year."
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala be in the historical center that in the periphery.
The rules provided for include a means of tax facilitation for managers and advantages to the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic zone and have special parking charges.
"It's an initiative that I like" notes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by putting other measures in place.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realize the "New cinema Paradise", which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or Quirinale of already closed National Way, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side”.
Link between politics and 'drangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli Cosca."
The judges of the Anti-Mafia Authority of Calabria are heavy indictees who give to the mayor and vice-maintainer of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the trustee of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by a mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his granddaughter, the homonymous lawyer of the boss, already condemned by criminal association mafia and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Depreciating any legal and moral, and good sense norms," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"The Mafia family – the judges write – would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of the control and command of the public administration."
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero calabré regional council does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who remain clean'.
This morning's arrests are added to those of the past July after the police announced the headcut of the Mafia Piromalli family.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had dissolved, as early as 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the steward of the Udc at the time of dissolution, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition after the whaling in May 2006.
I am exploiting a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the deputy interior minister who was Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representing a group very close to the Piromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration on the interests of the Mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the big world energy companies.
Olas, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of raising the energy of sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was turned away, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil give impetus to the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of the world's electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be the currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil colossal ha to the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create great problems to the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good drives between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good upwards and downwards, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure spins a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines at the East River in New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, spins the turbine paddles, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, said at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, deserves the potential of tides at this time.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the shores, have invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
