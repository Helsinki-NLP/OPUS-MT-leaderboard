The former head of the Brazilian presidential office is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential office for alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme concerning the state oil company Petrobras.
The federal prosecutor's office said that Jose Dirceu will be sued for charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Another fourteen people will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of the company services of Petrobras.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers' Party in custody for the connections to this scheme.
Dirceu served as the chief of staff of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested in early August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting purchase scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
Prosecutors said that Dirceu developed Petrobras' bribery scheme, accepted bribery while in office and continued to receive business payments after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the votes purchased.
According to prosecutors, Petrobras' scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribes for Petrobras directors in exchange for inflated contracts.
"Miraculous" Recovery of a Survivor Student of the Peshawar Massacre
A teenager paralyzed after being shot four times in Pakistan's most horrific terrorist attack succeeded in a "miracular" recovery after undergoing treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, was told by the doctors in Pakistan that he will never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the army's public school in Peshawar last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be released later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, an ordinary Tuesday morning, Mohamed was sitting at the first aid hour and listening carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men in guard uniforms entered the army's public school.
They wore explosive belts and had to perform a simple mission: to kill all men, women and children who were in the way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists came in and started killing.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was going on.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, calling him out.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held his hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that right after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the cheese down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his feet again.
They campaigned and called for help from Pakistani TV, attracting the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
Finally, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the UK and offer treatment at the London Harley Street private clinic.
Neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "scattered" when he arrived at the hospital.
“He had spent the last few months lying in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other,” says Malik.
He was weak, put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in very good shape.
A vertebrae from Mohamed's spine had been destroyed.
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during an operation that lasted six hours, Malik and his team were able to relegate the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised at what happened next.
Just one week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and going.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks after surgery, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and begin the long process of recovery.
Mohamed defied the fate and started to go again
He wants to become strong and to continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I have another chance at life," he says, showing the images of guns drawn by him next to school manuals and pens.
Physically, Mohamed becomes more powerful every day, but psychological trauma through which he passes and is now unimaginable.
"My anger has not fallen," he confesses.
In my school were murdered little children.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, comforts him on the rise and says, "I see my son walking again."
He'll be able to continue his life.
Three "Super Voice" 4G Service delivers better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a larger area
Three mobile phone provider has launched a service in the UK that says it will improve reception inside buildings and in wireless rural areas.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "VoLTE's Voice Over Long-Term Evolution".
It currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: "By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and they will be able to use their phones in more places than ever before."
The sees are preparing for the stage of the pantomime
The Pantomime Traineeship is very important for theatres throughout the UK, many of them now preparing for this year's traineeship.
Now, some of the biggest names in the showbusiness are participating in the Christmas theater.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella -- first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and second in the role of fairy.
They reveal their pantomime secrets at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I don’t do anything, I feel guilty”
Steven Wilson was recently nominated as the Grand Winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been named the most working musician in the progressive rock world.
The talented musician won three prizes at the Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a work of intelligent, expressive and captivating art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several musical projects, most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson only launches a double LP in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love for vinyls and about his busy program and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right in the end period of the vinyl era, and I remember that at that time I was just waiting for the CD, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a record, you were going with him home, he had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic music, they are better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there's nothing you can really value anymore.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're left absorbed in lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have to be like this if some kids too young to remember vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl to which you especially care?
I admit I got rid of all the winery in the '90s.
All the vinyls we've got are bought again.
I started from the idea of remaking the collection that I was 15 years old, but I went beyond that limit.
The first record I convinced my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it is somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on the vinyl?
It was originally conceived as an idea for record stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My record house suggested to gather some of my short and more accessible songs.
I got to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I really kept the project only on wine.
Who buys vinyl also receives a downloaded variant to high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its real light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music pieces, there's one thing I've always valued above anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the test of time because they always put their accent on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the performances at Albert Hall?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
In the first, there will be a version of the show Hand. It was. which I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will rather be an incursion into my history, being more oriented to fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And I and the others on the tournament team are big fans of [Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we give all the time quoted from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, too, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
Seems to me I'm extremely lucky to have him in the opening.
You remixed albums of some bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that influence your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by that, but inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they stay in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Rejected to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I had worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the most busy progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly powerful work ethic.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remix work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy, I don't think I'd survive.
Transience will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will play at Royal Albert Hall on September 28 and 29, as part of his 2015-2016 European tournament.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans hired part of the airline staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the redecorated company in northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members have regained their job.
Skytrans, the company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that formed much of the airline's business.
The bankruptcy caused several communities to face potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, the federal national-liberal parliamentary for Queensland of the North, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, rebooted the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, CEO of Skytrans, said the airline's QCG contract has already created jobs.
"We managed to re-engage 18 Skytrans staff members on full-time, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we have increased 100% of our workforce, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract seeks to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and the Torres Strait, and also includes a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for QGC staff and Brisbane entrepreneurs to Chinchilla and Taroom locations in its 36-seat Dash-8 aircraft starting Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, CEO of the QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tendering procedure.
"We are delighted that this contract will help expand a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal MP and Mommy Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice of making a bigger reserve of milk to avoid voting in the Chamber
It seems that more women will be part of the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be surveyed on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a larger reserve of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding from intervening in her parliamentary duties.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who subsequently consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a nursing parliamentary, in accordance with the existing ordinances.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter Olivia.
According to the existing orders - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - mothers who breastfeed get a voting power in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before consulting the opposition disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things have precipitated on two occasions, when O'Dwyer couldn't attend a division meeting and couldn't fulfil his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the MP was thinking of making a bigger milk supply instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Queensland Parliamentary, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
They both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but sources separated from Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the Higgins division's representative was furious when he was told to make a bigger reserve of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working to make up his new cabinet.
Buchholz, Queensland's Liberal National Parliamentary, was promoted as a disciple-in-chief by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott as part of the negative effect of the February of this year's censor motion test.
O'Dwyer, in image with Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a censor motion in which he wanted his removal from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, the Tasmanian liberal, was also promoted and appointed to be responsible for adjunct discipline.
Nickolic had recently kept the front page of the newspapers after finding that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to quit challenging Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter Olivia was born in May.
It's one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The Labour Party spokesman Catherine King said on Wednesday that the voting power for breast-feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"She's [seven] now," she wrote on Twitter.
The disciplinary officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in ministry, throughout the country," the Prime Minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in his first cabinet and, after sustained pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the December remand.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets react?
Mal Maiden, a publisher at BusinessDay, examines the impact that Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to show more enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country as Prime Minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply he had arrived in a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of the interest groups spoke to unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to meet public interest, reach political agreement and do things right.
So what exactly are the country's largest companies and their representatives waiting for our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising.
Turnbull itself set free trade agreement with China as the beginning objective.
In his first speech in which he announced on the media that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) was the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized "the revolting outbreaks of economic chauvinism" by the Labour Party on that issue and expressed concern about the racist temptation of criticism.
"In the context of ChAFTA, winners are, numerically, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, supported among others by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wishes to conclude this agreement and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising and negotiate with the entire Senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could still lead to some divergences in the business environment.
The impact assessment applies to large mergers and other contracts in order to decide whether consumers will suffer due to lack of competition.
It is called "impact assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions, but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this evaluation is drawn up is extremely important for the result.
Harper's analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to ban smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the Australian Business Council and the great retailers.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped to burn to say that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of Harper's analysis, consumers will have to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that has advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for the processes in the cabinet, which Turnbull seems to do by leaving Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Enterprises (which is on the side of Harper's recommendations) to support his arguments before his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women between sixty and eighty years of age.
Those who eat mainly olive, fish and oil have reduced the likelihood of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the board of multiplication under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard thinks I've completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in Empire told Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one time is equal to one.
"How is it equal to one?" he said.
If one times one do one, it means two has no value, because one times he himself has no effect.
One time I do two, because the square root of his four is two - so what is the square root of his two?
There should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors disagreed with his theory, so he quit the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"So you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the term "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassemblying scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "once once" and other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
Editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "cartiums with infinite shapes more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, bound between them with copper wire or magnetically trapped".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for applications improved by construction bricks").
Also, the actor in "After an idol" also says that Pythagoras Einstein and Tesla would "take her crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three-four years old why a bubble takes round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
"This will be the last century our children will learn that one time they do one," he said.
They will no longer have to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that one times one do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll be checking in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande an imitated Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang a little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" played with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
Also, the two performed, on a number of occasions, versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" by The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name has always appeared in the press.
On the same day it had also been at "Good Morning America", where it opened the show with the incident of the Gogoasa lynx.
Taco Bell hopes that the restaurants "Cantina" in which it will be served will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in Chicago's Wicker Park area, offering a snack tapas menu, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants in the chain, which are addressed to young people, who are increasingly concentrated in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average 7 USD Taco Bell payment note, the company used drive-through service and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address the new generation that "looks for more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow yourself," said U.S. TODAY Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell franchise that will operate the Chicago location.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional offers Taco Bell, in an open kitchen, where "you will be able to see your own food" before being prepared, said to the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will also be served at the new location, following the recent example of many of Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "evening" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of the around 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that other location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an inside yard and a window for sales.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other customers outside those who are looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he inaugurated more expensive Cantina and burritos menus, to compete with Chipole, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If successful, the Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland said for AP, "some hundred" of them will be of the "Cantina" type.
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John's courting Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on Monday night, only a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet Russian politician to discuss Russia’s ancient legislation together.
The British songwriter, said, tried unsuccessfully to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, a year after he challenged the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, during a hectic period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "homosexual propaganda" in the children's turn.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made in front of fans the following statement: "Although I'm gay, I always felt like I was well received here in Russia".
If I wasn't honest about what I am, I wouldn't be able to compose those songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They are the way I express life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there's no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos sang all over the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a barbaric conviction, chanting still in front of the judges and detailing how he shared the millions of euros to the former members of the ANRP Commission.
Hearing yesterday at the High Court of House and Justice in the file in which he is tried with the son or Alin Cocos, by the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and by the former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Payments within ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by lightning sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges in the morning how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of ANRP damages, instead asking to be judged faster and to keep in mind his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he agreed with him for more real estate business.
He mentioned that Sergiu Diacomatu met in 2010, and he told him he was working at ANRP.
Then I found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) was vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at the ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money I told him I'd give him in more trances.
I also promised him political support, so he could stay in office.
"Diacomatu told me then that he was helping me, but that he needed support," Dorin Cocos showed in the courtroom.
He also said that later, by a knowledge, he came into contact with the Dumetrien Crinuta, who was then head of the Central Compensation Commission, who promised him €800,000.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave him five million euros.
The Dumitrean Crimean a million euros, the Dragos Bogdan I gave 800,000 euros.
I specify that all this money was in the trance to make sure that the file was solved.
"That's all I told them: to fix the file, to pay off," Cocos showed.
Asked why he got to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of the second file of Gheorghe Stelian.
I got, for the second folder, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I was left with only 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," Cocos showed.
He also showed that "it was remarkable that all the NRP members understood each other before the meeting."
I wasn't nervous they wouldn't vote positive.
All functions were political in ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu politically.
"I told him I was only helping him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
The bridge brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file "Turceni - Ruvinari".
Victor Ponta ran DNA with a European Court of Justice document
Convinced that the prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the sidelines of the file where he is researched for fakes in private signatures, complicit in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, though the documents that could have been sent through counsel.
It wasn't like that, as the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left for the recording several documents.
I wanted to file the decision of the European Court of Justice on 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we did the work, the prosecutor says we didn't do the European Court of Justice told us to see each other's business, because as long as the fees were paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, sure, for all the countries of the European Union, we don't have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on his way out of DNA.
The bridge also stated that, from the point of view or from the point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it back to the hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the disjunction of the file.
Iohannis savors his mandate without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV tax once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that Romania's president's position is also connected to everyday realities.
President Iohannis is immersed in a total silence every day in his office or in Cotroceni.
Only that, to the astonishment of even his closest men at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after he doesn't look on TV - at any program, not even at the German RTL or Pro Sieben posts - the president doesn't listen to the radio stations either and does not read the newspapers either.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Instead, Iohannis was happy to receive only the report of the news that put him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-isolation, in which the only gap is the access of the facebook, much worse is the blockade to which, through its passiveness, the head of state impels the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so bitter since its installation in function, Iohannis hasn't yet signed out for more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration's loyalty statements.
What becomes an increasingly serious problem, both from a human point of view and a legal point of view.
Peace and tranquillity
Those in the presidential entourage are already clear that no one and nothing can spoil the "feng shui" of the state chief's office.
Where is quiet and peace.
What is right, just after the new hour without a minute (no more, no less!), morning, when the former building of Sibiu demands the presence of the officials.
A custom that probably hasn't gotten loose since the time he was leading the city's main town on Cibin.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in the office have already been born countless legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to tilt to the variant that the president would try to avoid its monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have any radios.
Only that, at this rate, they follow to meditate as soon as possible in the dark, because lighting devices can also hide the audio-video recording technique.
Only good.
Also, another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "pzoitious monitoring" of the President's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of state will get her continuum.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" under the conditions that, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a follow-up to the night broadcasts on the TV where he was criticized, but demanded every morning, with priority, the negative news.
That doesn't mean museums like he helped him, but that's what the gesture matters!
And at least he can't ever have an excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Neither out nor confirmed.
Now, eventually you're gonna lick it and the mystery why you don't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
Until then, more importantly, the contractual situation of the hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration would be resolved, no matter what formula.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in charge and who must bear his signature as well.
Only, from December to now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation even half of these statements, although it had to happen within 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be released.
Only that they all received no negative opinion!
So at one point, I can come anytime the Court of Auditors inspectors, who will find that over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That's until the president decides whether to release him or confirm him on his post, which is strictly his decision.
Authorities said that a teenager was planning an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed Tuesday a source of police for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in Philadelphia in August, when law enforcement authorities dismissed the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the President of Homeland Security, during an interview on Sunday, said a source for Fox News.
"We are monitoring the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week".
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a newsletter.
the joint information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, in which it is claimed that the adolescent planned to use several attackers, firearms and explosives, having as target "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The bulletin mentions that the minor has radicalized through social networks.
The adolescent may suffer from a mental illness, a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News said, but without giving accurate details about the young man's illness.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "lonely wolf" across the nation and noted that it was informed by the Secret Service about a "secret secret assignment" for the Pope's visit.
And with that comes a great security risk... but as the time comes, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The schelet dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, the experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of an old 215-year-old tree.
Collooney's face, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish Service of National Monuments brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering a fascinating story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Archaeological Services Sligo-Leitrim, for FoxNews.com.
At the upper part of the chest, there are knife wounds. He has such a mark in his left hand, which suggests he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton belongs to a young man between 17 and 20 years old.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't know if he was killed in battle or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents attesting that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but there are no visible traces of them today.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the young man's height.
"Avea 1 metre 77", says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means pretty much.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent almost $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, called “The way babies and young children perceive food” is carried out by the University of Chicago and, so far, has determined that young people are not prepared to eat food that is easy for others or that they have sneezed on others.
According to the project's funding, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets".
There is evidence to suggest that the first dietary patterns of babies and young children have lasting consequences for the health of the entire life.
The premise for this study is that there is no research on how babies view food.
"Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying the way babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food," said the financier.
The current proposal applies cognitive development methods to test social influences on choices and consumption of food to young children and babies.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited food knowledge".
Children aged between three and six years "know more about food than babies and young children", but they are "extremely mofturous consumers".
An actress who played in "Star Trek: Voyager" is charged with indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the television series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in eastern Tennessee, accusing herself of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that the 41-year-old actress Jennifer Ann Lien, who played Kes' role in the television show, is accused of two indecent exposure offences, involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the chief's office in Roane County brought the warrant of arrest on September 3rd, at the home of Lien in Harriman, where they say they found her naked under a blanket on the couch.
The officers said that Lien refused their requests to dress.
Police chief in Harriman, Randy Heidle, says that Lien has been brought with him several counts, including the aggravated bodily injury, after the April incident in which he says that he entered a police car with his personal car.
She still doesn't know if she has a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose body in decomposition was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On September 9, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in north-east London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Haringey Green Lane area, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes on the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body was probably in the Epping forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan Police, said: “Mr. Aksakal was well known locally as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to find out from the community of Green Lanes information to help us investigate.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist site, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat walks.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Pray to all who have been in the area for the past few weeks and may have noticed any unusual or suspicious activity coming to discuss with us.
Super chief: six women juggle between maternity and service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, in the United States of America there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid.
Two weeks ago, when the executive director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work in time" of her free time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But mayer, she herself a symbol of the top woman, be blamed for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, deputy attorney and director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, had just obtained a government job in Washington DC a few years ago when her boss amazed her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," she said to her boss.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, start collecting your vacation from now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't get a single maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was unmarried and very focused on career, and the family was the last thing he was thinking about.
But he listened to the advice of her boss.
She avoided using her medical leave for four years, so when she got pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had been paid three months off.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave that he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not put any value on the fact that you will become a parent.
Karen Choi, vice-president at the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any employed woman who is and mother should be commended.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling between motherhood and work as "a constant struggle".
The secret to not suffunt is to have "an incredible family with you" and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that you're not going to be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at interior amenities") and just go through it.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has a fever, he throws up, and you stay up all night to care for him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had nothing to suffer.
When she entered the finance industry, after university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have quit.
The women who quit the job, then start again don't have the same chances at top positions paid well, she says.
It is difficult to remain: "The short term is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen".
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move forward is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates the scientific researcher and Professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
The children know their mother is actually helping to save lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Assessment of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great goal" in terms of career and fulfil it.
It's very important that women believe that I can have a vision.
Most of them don't allow themselves to believe this," she says.
He once had a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was pregnant in eight months.
He also helped technology, she says, because he can stop the car and answer the phone after he takes his children or respond to an e-mail from the go.
The juggling between motherhood and a demanding career was helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to an end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the CEO of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making motherhood and career work together only through private support networks, such as the dolls, is wrong.
"You shouldn't have any luck or win a lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, poor health care system and the lack of paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't take care of each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who've just been born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of law, was born her child while she was first on the scholarship.
With a husband and child based on the medical assistance offered by the scholarship, the labour leader was able to take a maternity leave of only two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion stylist and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining the programs set by common agreement and accepting that the efficient thing does not mean staying on the program.
At the forefront of logistical constraints, Mosko says, there is the additional pressure to activate in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mamic hay" is one of the most serious insults).
“ Imagine is part of our job, ” she explains.
Mosko's "permanent trading" for her multiple roles to function harmoniously means keeping her face dry and a beautiful bag in hand, of which sometimes one toy-two falls.
If he remembers that men are also fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who deals with homes of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that motherhood and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little improper.
It's more like a whaler," she says.
The mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a maternity leave seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important time for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning at 06:00 ('more cheap as therapy') is still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create a "friendly environment for parents", where a child's delay is allowed, and the reply to e-mails should not necessarily be sent from the office.
"The concept and the notion of family have changed and changed a lot," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The place of work is the place to adapt.
Russian humors say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it wasn't true: despite an exuberant Instagram post that thanked the Russian leader for addressing him on the issue, it immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night certainly hadn't been Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet with him or call him, or at least not soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became president's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov.
"But it seems that Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people we were giving ourselves," he said to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most charming of my life.
In order to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a video of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements on farce speculations.
At the heart of the story are the comments that the singer made on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his “ridical” attitude towards homosexuals while he campaigned for LGBT rights in Kiev, criticising in particular a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of “propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations” among minors.
"I'd like to meet [on Putin], to speak," John said to the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic," it still deserves a try.
Then, Monday evening, the singer sparked the distrust of observers when he published a message on a social network, saying that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said that "he is looking forward to meeting [the President] face-to-face in order to discuss LGBT equality in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for their joked phone calls many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and claimed he would be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told journalists Tuesday that Putin would “prepared to meet Elton John and answer all his questions,” but that Kremlin did not receive any such request from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to doubt the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, "especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English."
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with similar spelling mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared his public sham, the local media already suspected John was the victim of a joke.
Some online users had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the farces made by the phone politicians they register and posted on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls in jokes to public people, then publishing the recordings has become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, which is considered by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to make farces to Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian TV imitating Anton Gerașchenko, the direct advisor of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoski, over six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests after massive fraud reports.
Acting as Arkadi Dvorkovich, the advisor to the then president Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the president of the electoral commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former President Mihail Gorbachev, Prime Minister of Kiev and Box Champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian Minister of Sports Vitali Mutko, whom he tricked into apologizing for his athletes' drunken behavior.
Last year, Krasnov would have called President belarus Aleksandr Lukașenko, giving himself as the son of the Ukrainian leader who resigned, Viktor Yanukovich.
It was so convincing, that the person at the other end, whose voice resembled Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin provoked a huge reaction in Russia.
Justice Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John shouldn't bother Putin with a "so irrelevant" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
Moskovsky Komsomolets opened an online reader survey, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% felt that such a meeting would harm Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS.
According to a new baseline study, over 3 million people a year die prematurely due to air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burning for heating housing and cooking, but research reveals that such an alarming reason is the agricultural emissions from Europe and the USA, which are the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of dead - already equivalent to six dead per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should trigger an alarm signal for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
These cause heart attack and heart attack, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the journal Nature, is the first to highlight various sources of air pollution from outside and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, considering road traffic, fossil fuel-based power plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computer model of global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects Chinese and Indian inhabitants.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of fumes, such as wood and coal, for heating or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which were recognized dangers.
Consumption of this type of internal energy results in half of India's 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, the research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Leveld of the German Chemical Institute Max Planck, who led the research.
One fifth of global deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and the excess use of fertilisers.
The ammonia reacts with the exhaust gas from the traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, the main reason for the deaths due to air pollution in the east of the USA, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Leslieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the dead, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of global deaths, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the power plant, in particular by those operating with coal, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the US, it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55,000 deaths per year, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in dry and dusty regions, caused almost one-fifth of global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some dry countries, being responsible for 92% of the dead in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of inhabitants speaks about public health, but nothing is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
The results are surprising and potentially important for overall public health protection.
Now all particles are supposed to be as toxic.
But if those caused by combustion of fuels are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, says Jerrett "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both by scientists and politicians".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: "The study really highlights the need for air quality control, to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia."
Victor Ponta's statement further strains relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman premier speaks of attitudes that remind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a fence at the border with Romania, after the one at the Serbian border, have known a new depreciation following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities of Budapest Monday of treating refugees "with bat and inserted".
Hungarian diplomacy reacted harshly speaking of "extremist and lying" claims, but neither did Victor Ponta go any further and accuse government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
It is not for the first time Ponta tries to strain Romanian-Hungarian relations through statements made at delicate or electoral times.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem you have with our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with a bat and inserted.
I don't agree with that.
Mr Basescu has put himself at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's up to us to solve the problem.
"We're going to treat those people like us," Victor Ponta had said on Monday, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta mentioned when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but the Czechs was recently at the center of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that recalled the procedure used by the Nazis to identify the Jewish prisoners in concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by Magyaridok.hu, as probably the internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make the "extremist and lying" statements.
The Romanian business graduate from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, inform Mediafax, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis," the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says.
Levent Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-Hungarian lies", stresses the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from Hungarian government representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the outrage that I feel, as a European man and citizen, against the mentality and attitudes that Europe has seen only in the 1930s-40s!!!", Ponta wrote on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European policies, he has "the duty" to attract attention and punish "the constant behaviour of some government officials of the highest level in Hungary" who are "a disgrace for the culture and values of the European Union" through "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Sarma guimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in superiority of European values", and "what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!".
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject constituted Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military grabbed and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considered that the Roman authorities should not have a "feeling approach" to Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The UDMR leader says that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Romanian citizens, he showing that the fence might even help our country not become an intense route transited by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
In the first place, I want to point out, I say, that we don't have to get hysterical, take this whole thing like something against Romania and you don't have to use it to aggravate the bad relations between the two governments anyway, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach, the visceral isn't right.
"We need to see the rational side, see why we have come here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the Romanian citizens and it does not prevent free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to remove Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia proposed more than three years ago the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at that time in negotiations with the gates between the western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Finland's former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Martti Ahtisaari, said Western powers haven't taken advantage of the proposal since then.
From 2012 to the present, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been forced to flee the country, giving rise to the worst refugee crisis since the end of the Second World War.
Ahtisaari had discussions with the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (US, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also said that during the talks, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin offered a plan that included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the start of the peace talks between regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we must look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, reporting the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was going to fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," continued Finland's former president.
Russia has officially strongly supported Bashar al-Assad over the course of the four and a half years of war, insisting that its removal cannot be a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun to send troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to defeat the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenna 3's live Internet program will be available against cost
Antena 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that on November 1 the program or live will be able to be viewed online against cost, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "letter to viewers", the Intact Trust's news station states that "we do this with a tight heart, wishing to stay with us and in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that the viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antena 3 argues that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, day-to-day news have been and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which assumed a permanent retechnologicalization and focus on quality".
We have succeeded in supporting ourselves, under the conditions that offline and online distributors have contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes under the conditions in which the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and the online platform Antena Play, where, moreover, the most often exclusively accessible were the recordings of the Antene broadcasts.
Reports show that the populations of animals and marine plants have half-lived in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in a study that states that marine species throughout the globe, including those essential to human food safety, are in a catastrophic decline.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions in the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a turning point of difficulties for almost every marine life, says the WWF's "Vine Blue Planet" report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of commercially valuable fish, such as macro and tuna, have decreased vertigo with three quarters compared to the 1970s, shows the ratio.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by half this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to worsen as a result of the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing a direct proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid at sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief adviser on marine policy at WWF-UK, who contributed to the drafting of the report.
"With overfishing, which damages coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we are sowing seeds of an ecological economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the published scientific literature, as well as the Living Planet Index, a database maintained by the London Zoo, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has researched a great diversity of marine species, from fish, marine turtles and sea martens - a wormlike animal, with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algal areas decreased by about 30% in the last century, while total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundance of ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, Managing Director of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fishing species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macro, ton and sardines - decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, with no signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end up with the deprivation of people from a vital food source and a key economic engine.
Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and strongest," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle for the eradication of poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, Scientific Director of the ZL, said: "These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the oceans and represent a clear warning about the problems we might face as a result."
Seaweed: "fish" long submarines that catch sediments rich in minerals and stabilize the bottom of the sea.
Over the last century, the coverage area decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: Their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of the total marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are at present threatened and many may disappear during this century if ocean acidity continues to worsen.
The deep habitats: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations in the last 40 years suggests that they too are affected by marine changes globally.
Steven Gerrard denies the accusations of racism that would have been brought to him by his former teammate at Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a reaction, Diouf would have responded to Gerard as a Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked black people".
Gerrard's lawyers have denied any charges of racism brought against him.
In his most recent book, Gerard, who has published his bad opinion about Diouf before, criticized his former colleague's attitude and professionalism.
“I don’t want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons at Liverpool as an example of how I can go backwards,” he says.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way he spitted a huge and rowdy phlegm into a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup match at Parkhead in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and gruesome behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being Celtic Park.
The Senegalese mayor was questioned by the police after the spit episode and fined with his salary for two weeks at the club, the sum of 60,000 pounds being donated to a humanitarian organization in Celtic's election.
In his earlier autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
“His attitude was completely wrong,” Gerrard wrote.
I felt he wasn't just willing to make all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at Malay Sabah Club, in turn criticized Gerrard in public and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf named Gerard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to the victory of the Champions League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't hit the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the chief's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the football world, the biggest football experts framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and between the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am revered, while Gerrard is husked every time he leaves his hometown of Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick road to "Dancing With the Stars"
This season in Dancing With the Stars, Alek Skarlatos is not just playing the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, say producers.
"He kisses many categories and we always look for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of ABC.
I swear he'll find his agent after that.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he competed at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after taking a strong stand in the face of a great danger.
He and his two childhood friends Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of travellers going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what might have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, 22-year-old Skarlatos, sentinel to the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may have anticipated some local appreciations - Friday, in Sacramento, there was a parade in the honor of the young - it did not expect so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"I never thought I'd get this offer in a million years," Skarlatos confessed on Saturday, at a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show on Monday evening he admitted that he was "slightly nervous," he acted as a professional at his first foxtrot, obtaining scores that brought him almost to the forefront of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for invited competitors on the last hundred meters, as is the case with Skarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who had a gun attack on a 500-passenger train and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When he appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with ABC's sister program to avoid going through all the media.
He supported his "five-minute plea," then eagerly waited to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"Sometime it was all very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, I was fighting in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he wanted to dance.
Skarlatos, who is on a short vacation from the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just him out.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their sleeve: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with amputated hand and foot.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the fans' favorite competitor and finalist last season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "follow-up" and "insistent messages," she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will look and how the image of my friends will be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great sports and history lover, had never danced before, and Arnold testified in interviews that he was trying to make him more relax and give up his rather rigid military stance.
But Katz says she is confident that she will adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support him?" Katz said.
But that will only take a few weeks.
To move on, you have to dance.
Skarlatos, who's a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says he's had a lot of fun in this completely unknown environment of his.
The program was the hardest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was acclaimed in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.
Altogether, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in the taking of a person who attracts the media attention, but it is not usual to be in the spotlight, the executive producer Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure the contestant gets along and has fun.
"The pressure is high and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"Wouldn't I ever want Alek to say, "Oh, God, what did I get into?"
Let's hold his fists for fun.
McRib of McDonald's is coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year long for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-tails to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchises in the country offer this seasoning specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"The 2015 McRib promotion is attended by about 8000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesperson Lisa McComb told The Times in an email.
In the US there are just over 14,300 restaurants of this fast food.
But according to McComb, individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," says McComb.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they believe their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video showing the reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's restaurants participating.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is served (unaffiliated with McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and they can search the nearest place to serve this sandwich.
But a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant in Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight BBQ chicken appetite.
Keith Richards understands that we would prepare new Rolling Stones records
Keith Richards is again in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon the other members of Rolling Stones may join the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - recently met in London and made "clear recording plans," as he says.
On Tuesday evening, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including performances at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
On the last of these, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, working on the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a five-decade career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' harsh voice is a rather kind instrument than distinguished..."
But Richards sparks emotion in all 15 songs of the album, and that always meant rock 'n' the roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any further details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem much simpler than they were actually.
Once a child actor in television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult, he reaffirmed himself as an inexpressive character in the television series "Situation of crisis" and in films such as "Steves of nightmares".
The first film he worked as director was the very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated for the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with the "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious film in terms of tone, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abeire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of troubled brothers.
The film has as its subject a festival that seeks American distribution.
Many reviews of the book have considered it a comedy with powerful emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview given to our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book more of a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin approached a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of Monday night benefited from an introduction from the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially to the site "The Hogan Family" in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, to which Bateman worked. "I have not met too many "Hogan Family" fans, said Bateman sec when he climbed the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
His new film's story has a family named Fang at the centre.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way their children are used, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example putting together a bank robberies with their gymnasiums or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
In adulthood, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is more famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines who try to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear into mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what exactly in the story of child actors who want to evolve in adult life has been directly and deeply reflected in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
"It's a story that I feel connected to and that I understand in depth," he added, "and although I haven't tried to add to it my personal experience, I knew very clearly how this film should look to represent children with an untraditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she made the film, which gained rights to Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abeire was co-opted, which adapted his own piece "Treating to Reality", in which he played Kidman.
Bateman confesses that he has accepted the opportunity to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not take part in the Monday premiere.
The author of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" that "gives the clichés of the much overexploited gender of the dysfunctional family and dispels the mission, sometimes of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet, incisive and usually very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very harsh portrait" and noted that Bateman "shows visible progress and a greater maturity as film director with this structured intelligent adaptation, but never too tight or mechanical".
After the Monday screening, when Bateman and Walken climbed the scene for the question session, the public ovated the Walken crowd long.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that “I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which she changes her work as director of the film, which is very difficult, and that of the actor in the scenes.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain stage of dialogue, Bateman stands on a ladder in the family home behind the frame, hidden in the basement, only a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and more clearly visible.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor discussing with Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to make films," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to take advantage of me as an actor.
Having a privileged posture of being the one responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
No matter what, that... actor wants a foreground.
During the question-and-answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, but also to composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known mainly for his long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", Brian Helgeland's performance of the British gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' "Carol" film.
"The stuff with toned or obtuse tones seems very interesting to me," says Bateman, giving more explanations Tuesday.
Sail through those tones and guide the harmonious and somehow elegant audience from one to next during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as director and as actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and determination, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished his introduction to the World premiere on Monday, "Well, bad, it came out exactly as I wanted it to."
The Festival sees as at Oscars about the story of the Boston Globe investigation of pedophile priests
Did you win $240 000 at the lottery?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15th.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 other winning entries were recorded throughout Australia, which shared the single estimated prize fund of $4 million X-Lotto.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from extraction X-Lotto 3555 on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
"We have tried very hard to spread the news, for one person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Detectives at forensics search the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where was last seen missing man Daniel Hind
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his course the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I hope they'll search the house, we haven't been informed they'll do it," she said.
Ms. Hind also said that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to talk and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have a lot of other family members and a half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Either way, we want him home and end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometers of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometers of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of the pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for trafficking in cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking in stolen cultural goods from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference to combat theft of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation had been reworked to match the new context, emphasizing the ban on cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for “Organised Crime Combating” (GDBOP) focused on the prevention of smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed third, after Italy and Greece, at the top of the traffic of objects and cultural goods.
Bulgarian Interior Minister has also shown that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historic sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has expanded and is described as a very serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, noted that filming of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that the cultural heritage of Syria is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funding from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal shares for the launch of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the amount bid is a strategic move of Aerojet to overcome its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
ULA says Blue Origin’s engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s AR-1 engine, a statement that Aerojet contradicts.
The new engines became a priority after American legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of military or spying American satellites after the annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both the Atlas 5 rocket of ULA, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that ULA develops and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a fully new engine and rocket, as ULA currently plans.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funding from the Air Force in the contracts expected at the end of the first semester of fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
She also claims that the entire company was eager to see how the Air Force would share a funding of about USD 160 million among rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
The competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide one third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
The company producing beer AB InBev plans a USD 275 billion merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest beer company in the world, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colos that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of about USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine the dominance of AB InBev' in Latin America with that of SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, and with their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," said analyst Andrew Holland at the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weaknesses in North America and Europe, where consumers prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the world's second-largest company and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that it was informed by AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must take place by 14 October at the latest, under British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing marketing costs, has previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A nearby SAB source mentioned that it's too early to say what it's going to do, because they didn't get an offer.
"At this point, we are in the phase waiting and deciding," the source said.
The speculations about a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for many years.
The moment of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a decrease of about 15% in the price of SABMiller shares from August onwards.
"This is exactly the time they were waiting for," said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller action, perhaps even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion dollars, which would also include the SABMiller duty.
That would make it the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which already announces a record year after the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest acquisitions in 1980.
The SAB shares have been close to 19.9% at £36.14, giving it a $90 billion stock capitalization.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could look for another fusion as a defense strategy, as it happened the previous year when he offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle of soft drinks with that of Coca-Cola (KO.N), and over the past few weeks there has been the suspicion of a combination with Diageo or the Australian beverage company Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The overall market share of AB InBev, the producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts from the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a relationship between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) twice as much as 2.5 of the present.
It is possible to achieve the target in 2016, the realistic date closest to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have how to borrow to finance an acquisition.
When he bought the company producing Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion dollars, the largest acquisition of ice money in history at that time. he left the report to grow more than five times.
An equally large climb would allow them to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev own just over half of the company, while the two main shareholders at SABMiller are the producer of Cigarettes Other (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.
On Wednesday, Otheria refused to give statements that AB InBev was approached, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analytical conference that he regularly assesses investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, the head of European equity investment, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, says that AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return the excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt revenues is somewhere about 15%.
But we consider that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage, 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination, there are significant burdens related to the breach of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies own about 70% of the beer market.
"The savings that could be made in distribution operations are great, and the pitfalls related to the violation of competition rules are even bigger," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent shareholding of the company owned by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement that governs it.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and to appoint a new CEO of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last 50 percent offer.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment on whether the company was interested in a bid, but Molson’s actions increased by more than 12 percent, to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the association CR Snow of SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that after the divestments, the combined group could hold a 28% share of the global market.

Pakistani police accuse a former air force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former air force pilot who would subsequently have donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said on Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who financially support activism.
Suspect Syed Sheaba Ahmed was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in an attack on a bus in May with members of the Muslim and Ismaelian minority, who killed 45 people, said to journalists the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja of the Department for Combating Terrorism of the province.
It will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has already funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Ahmed also offered financial aid for AQIS," he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian Subcontinent, an Al Qaeda branch founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces facing activism, corruption and murder.
After, in December, the Taliban rifles massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to suppress activism.
There have been tough attacks, while the army has also advanced more in tribal regions outside the border law with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers from Pakistani cities under the control of very poorly prepared and underfunded police forces.
Ahmed, 52, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public teachings were moderate, but in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in the city of Sargodha and left the Pakistani Air Force in 1998, said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
It subsequently entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross was denied the copyright application for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'," decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, which sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Miami Federal Court, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' judgment weakens the copyright infringement process that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, filed against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duet from Los Angeles, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous song from 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm Sufflin'".
The hip hop star said that the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin's song".
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling shirts and other products with the sufflin' slogan.
In the judgment of Tuesday, Williams says that "Hustlin', as a song, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is composed of ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous lyrics from the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it's "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared it impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band is an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kennedy Gordy et al, at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson is approaching Bombing Leader Donald Trump in the Republican preliminary elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped into polls with seven points.
After Trump's support of 27% in the most recent CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television star Mike Huckabee, senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
The support of Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and former CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, at one-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one leading the Bush family standards, dropped seven percentage points in a month, while Wisconsin governor Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson attracted more support than Trump among graduate students (29% compared to 21%), while Trump was ahead of Carson in the preferences of voters without a university degree (30% compared to 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of poll respondents said they were determined to support candidates in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said that I know who they're going to vote for twice as much Trump as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the 9-13 September CBS/NYT survey will be made public on Tuesday before a Republican presidential debate.
Carson's ascension in this poll reflects that of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the Presidential, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders climbed 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, New Hampshire, respectively, among the Democratic voters for the preliminary.
An ethics specialist claims that sex robots should be banned
An ethics specialist in the robotics industry has launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sexy robberies seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the patterns that inspire the way they will show, what roles they will have – are very disturbing,” she said for BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said to Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will help increase the level of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots that are now being manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from happening.
Certainly, industry seems to take a step forward.
A few years ago, True Companion inflatable doll-producing company launched Roxxxy, the world's first sex robot.
But concern about the possible high dangers of artificial intelligence is not uncommon, even among the great representatives of industry.
Even this spring, the Executive Director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that something really dangerous will happen in five years.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that “the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race”.
Great Britain welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
The next few days, Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extended government resettlement programme.
Asylum-seeking refugees arrive from camps at the border with the war-stricken country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees that the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said that the government is "working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that they be already provided with the assistance and support they need and deserve.
I know that the honorable members and the general public want to know more about the number of people and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May mentioned that the government needs to make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of enlargement requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything takes place properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the House up to date in this regard.
But I am pleased to say to the House that we expect to meet the first wave of refugees in the coming days and work quickly for planning more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew fury from parliamentarians and militants when he unveiled the government's refugee plan, many of whom felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but humanitarian status that allows them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures were only 12 refugees per day, and former Liberal Democrat MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were “deterioration”.
Further, Ashdown revealed that the children included in this scheme are to be deported when they reach the age of 18 if they do not receive asylum.
Major public figures and celebrities have also condemned the measures.
In a joint letter, big names like Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla recovers from global insecurity - RT Business
The Russian ruble was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble occurred due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by China's weights, the possible increase of the US Federal Reserve interest rate and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent prices increased Wednesday by 61 cents, reaching USD 48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.
CITITIONS MULT: most likely the interest rate will increase in the US by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by insecurity in China and the timing of the increase in the federal interest rate, which will continue to tone down oil and rouble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys of Rabobank, an expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor explaining the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukail and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, started buying rubles.
Global markets are looking forward to Thursday's decision of the Federal Reserve, whether or not it will increase the interest rate.
Markets believe that what could not be the first growth in nine years of the US interest rate will not happen and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and companies like Google, Amazon and the Verizon telephony company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been set at EU level.
Collaboration is the result of widespread unrest over the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in high-density urban areas such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco,” mentions research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and aerial rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, the concern has been amplified in the background of reports of events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"For the past two years, over 400 calls to metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
What is the solution: the construction of a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 meters, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As more and more small drones carry out commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the visibility of the pilot, or even completely autonomous flights, there is a need for some air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example the delivery of parcels in cities," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as airspace design, methods to avoid adverse weather conditions and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and redirection by similar methods to road traffic rules, such as signalling and lanes.
They expect to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union in the coming years.
"We already see small and innovative SME companies in the UK using this technology with considerable effects on energy, agriculture and the media," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: why does Facebook want to know what makes you sad
"A Look Back" works the same way, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, which are now more than the population of any country?
First, of course, a button of empathy will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - about USD 240 billion after the last statistics - is due to the unimagined amount of consumer data it owns.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of complex, in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is valuable in the first place for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their Facebook ads by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A button of empathy adds another data set and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who “ appreciate” a national football team, charitable organizations and promoters want to address themselves to those who, for example, “empathize” with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredibly sophisticated algorithms to narrow that huge universe of content that you could see into the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you have considered interesting in the past and, especially, what you liked.
There is no doubt on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unfortunate ones do not enter the algorithm, because people do not feel that they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it may decide to eliminate this kind of post from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see at News affects your emotional state and, especially, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple Facebook attempt (and published open with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and if they can adjust the algorithm to distribute more elements.
What will happen to the empathy button remains at the Facebook latitude.
Truly striking is the way that the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason this happens may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our lives in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that leads to a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it makes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the ones that are considered the most suitable to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that and soon they'll also have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team established that the body's signals can anticipate these sometimes violent changes before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take the appropriate measures.
The children with the autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say his head hurts or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is conveying to us, and we need to do that in a mild and intrusive way.
For example, simple color visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, understanding that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The information from the bracelets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping the caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Customer Services at the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present the technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology at Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we work, you see the spectacular difference that can bring in the quality of their life care technology. Now, applications for iPad literally give a voice to people who have never spoken.
Robots help autistic children learn to play hide and seek.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the coming weeks, French warplanes will launch air strikes on Syrian Isis targets, announced the government Wednesday, only days after President François Hollande declared the intervention a "necessary".
France will launch the first air raids on the jihadist Islamic State group in Syria "in the coming weeks," said defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday.
The French air forces are carrying out reconnaissance missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said on Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
"In the town of Marea there is an extremely powerful offense, and if it succeeds, it could destroy the one we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian national coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a coalition led by the United States, which for a year has bombarded Isis positions in Iraq, but Hollande has changed the strategy last week to expand actions in Syria, under conditions of political pressure it accumulates on the background of the jihadist threat faced by France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
The feature of blocking ads from iOS 9 will make your phone even faster.
The newest version of iOS 9 is released Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying about online editors - is the ability to easily block ads while browsing the web.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the mobile version of the Apple Safari browser.
In the tests, it turned out that, after blocking the ads, news sites like the New York Times are loading twice as fast, according to Reuters.
It also helps users maintain the use of their data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blocker and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular advertising blocker for desktop, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch in the future an extension for Safari.
People who use Ad Blocking Software programs encounter a few constraints.
Ads are still displayed in apps (from here win Apple money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their usage on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for the online media, which is largely offered free to consumers and is financially supported for many years by advertising.
A report says that blocking ads could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in revenues generated from ads just this year.
To activate ads blocking in iOS 9, users need to download an application to block ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension to block content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama met King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various topics, but probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king addressed the topic of the fight against the Islamic State and the ever-increasing crisis of immigrants in Europe - who already face hundreds of thousands who have left their home country to go west.
"Spain has worked hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has gotten worse in the last few months.
Obama also emphasized the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which the Spanish territory Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"With regard to foreign policy, we firmly committed ourselves to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
"We'll welcome you with open arms," Philip replied.
First lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a chat at tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States of America from ascent to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to make a visit to South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins the Luke Cage series
The famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the distribution of the future Netflix Luke Cage series at Marvel. He will be Mike Colter's antagonist, who plays the role of the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and the cousin of Cornell character "Cotonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who plans to bring an era of change to the streets that he has grown up," says a press release.
Her personal life and professional career are overtaken by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by the infamous actions of her cousin, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the leading role of the Harlem community," says Jeph Loeb, the executive producer and President Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will be premiered in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as a showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, 62, is known for TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Desperate Snows and Law Office, but also for movies Devil's Advocate, Mysterious Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 Years Slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series in the Netflix franchise.
Also soon will be broadcast Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scram Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second season of Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is a trend applied to high profile series, as trafficking in global social networks ensures success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to build on the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that talk a lot, like Empire and Scream Queens," said the president of Fox International channels, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We're just waiting to broadcast these very interesting series for fans from all over the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve daily bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season of the Empire, in which they will play famous celebrities like Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, premieres in September.
The new Scream Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the next day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will take part in the world premiere of the film "Spectres"
Prince Harry and Duke and Duke of Cambridge will attend next month in London at the world premiere of the latest film with James Bond, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter Wednesday, designating the premiere of Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as RFP in 1946.
In the past, the royal premieres have been selected and "Don't die today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, after which it will benefit top-level employees from the British film and television industry.
The premiere will also include actors from the film's distribution, including Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"spectres" will be broadcast in U.S. cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The Christie Brinkley model and the musician John Mellencamp were seen having dinner together for months, sparking the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where photographs surprised Brinkley's cheerful and smiling.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, sneakers and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken jeans, coats and boots.
Last October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who split up and with whom she constantly lies, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star of the Message for you at the Today's NBC show, saying that he was "an angel who was sent to me and I am very happy."
He added that "nothing ends until it ends".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, photographed for Seventeen magazine, walking after her mother.
The kings of arctic mosquitoes are big enough to take down a karibu
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the warmer climate, but global warming has proven to be a benefit to others.
One of these beneficial species is the arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, warmer temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed the locals to appear earlier and grow higher, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to exemplify the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under the conditions of a 2-degree Celsius increase in temperature.
Farmers are small, but they represent important members of the Arctic Trophy and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Processings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists better anticipate how a growing mosquito population could affect the karibu they feed with, the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, scientists at Dartmouth have combined their field results with the results of laboratory experiments that have researched how the temperature influences insect development and the readiness to be hunted by predators.
Although increasing the temperature makes the mosquitoes more vulnerable to the choleopter, it also gives them an early start in spring and makes their larvae grow faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
Several mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can develop, but only to the extent that they can support insect food sources.
The ability of mosquitoes to transform their survival rate improved into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies have shown that the use of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neuronal or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (RSS) are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children and therefore should be treated.
"These studies add to an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp, Deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in a press release, which published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are higher than the risks of antidepressant administration.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51 404 children in the Norwegian cohort study of the mother and child, investigating the effects of SSRI for the development of motor skills at the age of 3 years.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them were treated with prolonged medicines.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not so significant as to give delay a clinical importance".
A group of researchers at Adelaide University in Australia conducted a data review for 49,000 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort to discover the effects of SSRI on child behaviour up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of the children whose mothers had been treated against SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were most prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to bleed after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born in a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that although the study related the administration of SSRI at increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers had on the specific medical conditions of women - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the worst stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants," says Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Only on the basis of this study do we recommend that women stop treating drugs against depression during pregnancy, but should be closely monitored to minimise the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in case of the murder of the student at Virginia Technical University.
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham from Virginia University was put under the charge of qualified murder in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University who disappeared in 2009, announced on Tuesday the authorities.
The grand jury from Albemarle, Virginia, put Jesse Leroy, 33-year-old Matthew Jr. in charge of the murder of Morgan Harrington, in Charlottesville, on Friday.
Matthew is also charged with kidnapping with the intention of rape.
Each prosecution head receives the maximum life sentence.
Harrington, 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working resolutely and unabated for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm excited to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your doing.
For Jesse Matthew, the domino pieces of the consequences began to be seated.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty to the latter and is awaiting trial in this case.
He's staying in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew indicted for qualified murder in case of a student's death at Virginia University
Harrington went to U-Va on October 17, 2009, together with his friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group was separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't get back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a cab around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was wearing a black shirt with the Pantera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found next to a string of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated pond, on a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
During the era of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear whether that period overlapped with the time when Harrington disappeared.
Police say that a significant advance in the running of the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators have not made public at this time the details of the new evidence that led to Matthew being charged for the murder of Harrington.
Defense counsel Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The notice of the prosecution comes two days after the one-year anniversary of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
18-year-old Graham from Fairfax County was seen walking with Matthew in a downtown mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington was a constant presence at the rallyings and watchings organized for the missing U-Va student.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculations and media criticisms that must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"At all this time there have also been talks like "Why was she wearing short skirt?" and "Is she looking for candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we are dealing with a predator following the hunt," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jurors that, on a September evening, as she came home on foot from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a green area, beat her up and slit her throat, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought I had an end, I had to scream over," confessed the woman.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, said the woman.
A prosecutor told jurors that it's possible Matthew was scared of the headlights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after the DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive his sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said that he would most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his last daughter was seen.
"At least today I've taken another step," says Dan Harrington.
Jon Snow died or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the fate of the character or the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knows what the contract is or with the HBO position, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons will appear, he said he can't talk about it.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be time for me to bury myself in long film projects," said the actor.
The show's back on the little screens next spring.
Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of season four, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched various theories, according to which he would somehow be brought back to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called "Jon Snow's Power", 40 days after the end of the season, which has spread over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commissiona
The European Commission took the decision on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the programmes "Economic Competitiveness" and "Mediu", both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a statement by the representative of Romania of the European Commission, as a result of this decision, some EUR 120 million will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the following period.

"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the Hungarian diplomat's chief reacted.

Referring to statements made by the French Secretary of State for European Affairs Harlem Desir on the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a European strategy in the area of immigration", but insists that national borders must be protected.

Refugee Crisis: Jai Without a Solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that Thursday will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration into Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann asked on Tuesday for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The German Chief Executive expressed support for the recent Berlin decision to impose border controls in the face of the massive influx of asylum seekers, pointing out that the measure aims to facilitate refugee registration.
In its turn, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees between Member States on the basis of compulsory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal to redeploy 120,000 refugees between Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the mechanism for the urgent resettlement of refugees, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again provoked controversy, after the publication of cartoons that mocked the response of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the predominantly Muslim countries affected by war.
In his most recent number, the publication has again attracted attention, as well as critics on social networks, writes Reuters.
One of the drawings embodies an intricate image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowning Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after a failed attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
The drawing of Charlie Hebdo shows a child in shorts and shirts, with the face down on the sea floor, next to a billboard offering two children's menus at the price of one.
"So close to succeed," is the message that accompanies the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the headquarters of the Paris editorial office in January, is accompanied by the message "The evidence that Europe is a Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who walks on the water, while a smaller character wears shorts with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after it was the target of an attack by Islamist activists in January, following repeated threats after the mockery of Prophet Mohammed.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastically amended in Russia
The French chain of Auchan supermarkets has been fined over $370,000 by Russian officials, charged with breaches of food safety.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total over 25 million rubles, $372.000, relates the agency Associated Press, quoted by the US News.
However, the reasons for these fines have not been specified, and Auchan has not made any comment.
Also, the French chain of supermarkets is the target of the accusations of the Russian agency for agriculture, which claims that some meat products have been detected as being infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the issue of the extension of the European Union sanctions and the decision of France to cancel an agreement on the supply of Russian Mistral ships.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence at the border with our country.
MAE shows that it has been briefed on this decision and that it is not politically correct.
MAE shows, in a press release submitted to Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this intention shortly before being publicized.
In its turn, MAE informed the relevant decision makers in Romania in due time, as a matter of urgency, of the situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not politically correct in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it is further shown in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigrant crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax, said on Tuesday.
"The mass is necessary for the traffickers of people who transit Serbia to change their routes, with the probability of going to Romania," the Hungarian diplomat chief explained.
"The Garden would start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moves to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reports that extra-Community immigrants who are transiting the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union tried to cross the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can go around the fence in the area of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion (€71.8 million) for the construction of a controversial metal fence at the Serbian border, 175 km away, and for special centres necessary to accommodate immigrants.
The initiative of the fence is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor's insufferable body coffin will not be deposited in the Romanian Senate, despite the desire in this sense expressed by the politician's widow.
According to a press release Ziare.com, the Permanent Bureau of the Senate discussed a request by Doine Vadim Tudor on Tuesday for approval of the deposition of former Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.

LNP Senator Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in agreement with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
He also broadcasts Agerpres, the senators held a moment of retreat in memory of the former PRM leader, on the proposal of Senator UNPR Serban Mihailescu.

Refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors of towns at the border, polled on accommodation places
The mayors of the border villages of Arad County are questioned by the Police and Border Police, these days, about the places of accommodation for possible refugees who could reach Romania, but also for the gendarmes, where they will be mobilized to the border.
Nadlac City Building, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted including with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with border police, the national police and the local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I asked farmers, who have jobs in this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the edile said.
Immigrant crisis in Hungary: Blinded and water cannons at the border
It, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police requested information on the accommodation available in the case of a refugee wave.
We've been asked how many people we can accommodate.
In our town, we don't have refugee space.
We believe that such special centres should not even appear at the border, because they are harder to control here, migrants being tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in areas more remote from the border," said the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
In his turn, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he was asked both by places of accommodation for refugees and by forces of intervention, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could get a hold of the gendarmes.
We could find places on the Cultural Way, but for refugees we have no accommodation option.
"We have been questioned about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "starting on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it was established permanently".
"There's always a police officer at the station, and the locals know they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," the edile said.
The representatives of the Pilu Mayor said that they can accommodate up to a hundred people at the Cultural Way, the information being offered to the police officers, at their request.
Also, the mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanita, said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local public finances, but here are necessary facilities.
A former Border Police barracks could also be set up to host refugees.
The representatives of the Press Office of the Arad County Police did not provide a view on the questioning of mayors during this period, only confirming that "in border towns in Arad County patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander Announces Radical Measures Against Becali Star
Army Sport Club Commander, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures that will be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two parties negotiated a settlement, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historic "ros-blues".
The team that won the Champions' Cup is on break for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change for next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process that requires damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period we refer to by the ICCJ determination is very clear.
We have to recover the damage from FC Stara, the team that used the brand Stara without the owner's consent - the CSA Stara.
It appears very clear and the continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent of the Army club.
"So football team Star Bucharest, in one form or another, but in one legal form, must exist as a continuation of the skills it has so far in palmares," says George Boroi.
Becali's star and the Army Club have been in open war since the end of last year, when the supreme instant decided that the military were the ones with the "Steaua" brand.

The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, known as the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.

"Dorel" mounted the backlight
At Suceava, the workers have set up a traffic light upside down, so instead of being aware that they still have 4 seconds to wait, the passers-by gets the "h" message, which they don't know how to decipher.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Each passes as he cuts off his head.
Two boys were to be taken up by a car because they passed on red.
"Police at Rutiera should be here to help, until people get used to it," said one woman for the above source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Big Pieta in the center of Sucevei, but the passers-by doesn't seem at all willing to keep an eye on him, much more so as the information received seems to be misunderstood.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was found responsible enough to get his ok for finishing the work, then he wouldn't have gotten in this absurd situation.
Head of the Road Administration and Systematization Route of Suceava City Hall recognizes with candour that it was in front of when the traffic light started to work, but didn't realize that something was wrong.
We used them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was there when they were put into action," Stefan Vasincu said, promising that the problem would be rectified as soon as possible.
Thank God it can be remedied, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable havoc.
For example, when he worked on the Giurgiu-Russian pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling line that dug the tunnel under the Dunare, there is no known where, probably under the ground, buried, however it was not found, as even the minister of Economy, Mihai Tutose, supported.
Police put water cannons on immigrants
On Wednesday, Hungary's main border with Serbia, Hungarian border forces used tear gas and water tunnels against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, the Sarbo-ungara border continued to gather refugees, the Guardian writes.
The water cannons were put into operation when immigrants managed to get through the barbed wire through the Roszke border crossing point.
The Hungarian police maintain that the action of the cannons was a control measure of the crowd, throwing with water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were teary after the use of tear gas.
The Elena Enikos publication at the same time writes that two German companies refuse to deliver Hungarian garnished wire.
Tara has already raised the fence at the border with Serbia and announced on Tuesday her intention to raise one at the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticized in Bucharest.
German companies maintain that garbed wire is very dangerous and provoke cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisons or military installations, but should not be used against people who seek shelter, support companies.
In parallel with the confrontations at the Hungarian border, Croatia has mobilized to put at the disposal of the immigrants buses to transport those who present themselves to the border of the country with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, also showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, about the Greek drama - why he agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The declared goal of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader Syriza was part of a third loan agreement in Greece for this country, which involves even more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which conducts an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to re-entrust him as prime minister, in elections that he claims will strengthen his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismemberment of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of debt restructuring for Greece remains open," the former Prime Minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek government, showing that all financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece definitely needs reform," stating that it must begin with the reform of the state.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections in September after 7 months of storm at the head of the Athens Executive, the period when a third bailout loan was approved for Greece.

Star Trek actress, in prison because she got naked in front of some kids
Actress Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intruding Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to the prison, where she was from September 3rd - the bail being set at $2,500 - took place in front of her house in Tennessee.
The Vedeta started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of her children who was complaining, informs Mirror.
At one point, during the fight, the actress raised her shirt, showing her bust, so that, before she entered the house, she would take off her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress up.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was forced to the car.
It is not the first time when the 41-year-old actress has problems with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then doing guilt including assault.
Jennifer entered Kes' skin since 1995, after appearing in the American History X, a film in which Edward Norton also played.
He quit acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She is married to the writer and producer of Phil Hwang.
They're being taken in sight with the Western machine gun.
You no longer support terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has rarely interviewed the Russian press, in which he speaks of refugees and accuses the West of supporting the terrorists and that he "in sight" immigrants.
"The West cries for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when it said that this is a peaceful revolt," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader in Damascus argues that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it's not about Europe not accepting them or hugging them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, no more terrorist support.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," Syrian leader added.
Assad continued his accusations to the western states and as regards the treatment they show to the refugees.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with one eye and takes them in sight with the machine gun with the second eye, because those refugees have actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of the terrorists and the murders and in the second because of the results of terrorism.
"When you terrorize and destroy the infrastructure, you won't have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar of Assad.
"If we ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding as political forces, whether they are inside or outside the government, "we should join around what the Syrian people want."
Syria's president is of the opinion that the dialogue in the country should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is how we can achieve the political objectives that we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the Ukraine crisis, he was transformed from the friend of the West into his enemy.
Bashar of Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, again accusing the West of forging reality in both cases.
Note what happened in the Western press after the Ukraine hit.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses Russia's opposition and who has come to power by undemocratic means, despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, they're not democratic anymore.
"That's Western propaganda," Damascus leader scored.
Not in the last turn, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, "because it was faced with the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another neighboring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
Moreover, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, which fights terrorism: "Indeed, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand".
In other words, the coalition failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be with and against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will sting - then we have no objection in cooperating with all these countries, considering that it is a real coalition and not false, that fights against terrorism," the leader of Damascus said.
Autumn?
Not at all.

Map of countries with the highest prices and how Romania stands
The collapse of the oil quota has caused large losses in the last year of the workers in the extraction of the title, the shareholders of the energy companies and the countries that depend very much on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has been enormously cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, between October 2014 and July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the fuel price has decreased.
The most important price reduction to the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, the motor was cheap 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is held fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, changes in the taxation, but also the fluctuations in the currency course.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price of every state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
Thus, we ranked 27th in the country's most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this top position.
The girl of the last quarter of 2014, gas was cheap in the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a price reduction of 10.6%.
However, the countries around are even better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans are planning the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: what Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government will give additional support to the 16 Länder in receiving and distributing the tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through the south of Europe.
After an almost four-hour meeting with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to deal with the large number of refugees," notes DPA.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"These pivot points are needed," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, added Merkel.
Land leaders have asked for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal government coalition more than a week ago.
Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party asked for a "at least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated," in comments to a local newspaper.
At his turn, the Prime Minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be rapidly integrated into the German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for red tape in the handling of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Prime Minister Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria is carrying the hardest burden, with the most migrants arrived after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual door policy opened at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humiliating breakup with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was an nerve-car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Romanian coach was totally disturbed by the arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost the plot because she was disadvantaged.
Before the game I said one thing, that I wish to be respected.
Unfortunately, in games with major teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
It's two totally different ways.
We're getting a yellow cardboard right away, while the top teams don't.
Besides, the first penalty was not at all!
The ball hit Darijo in the back without touching his hand.
A game of such a level should not have been influenced by arbitration.
"I regret that arbitration broke the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what does that smell like here?"
They were pieces of the cut husband.
A murder of a common Sadism has terrified the inhabitants of Târgu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Târgu Frumos could see terrifying scenes near the main entrance into the market.
Along with the three dumplings, the killers "assembled" into pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
He was cut, but he lacked his head, his internal organs, and his genitals.
In the end, it would prove to be the body of an ex-officer, who had been cut off by his wife, a geography teacher.
"The Iasi Zairian" stood talking to the dele even with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing it, to carry the bags with the dead body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who alerted the cops yesterday about the fact that a woman who had three bags that were in a terrible mood, after pieces of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from Târgu Frumos.
Like in American movies, the man himself helped transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing it, the killer being a client for a race.
The taxi driver exclusively told about the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the sacks in which the body pieces of the geography teacher's husband were found, which he had cut off.
She had come to Targu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the murder as far away from her home from Roman.
Maybe he has mine.
I didn't have any idea.
Nea Mihai, as he is known by his friends who practice taxi services in Târgu Frumos, has become a star overnight in the little town he lives in.
He has seen American films throughout his life, but he never believed that he would ever be himself who would stand at the basis of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and would see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
He tells us that, on Monday night to Tuesday, he expected usually the arrival of busses that regularly transit the locality.
It is close to the intersection of the roads to Roman and to Easter.
The taxi driver reports that the killer woman observed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the bags with body pieces supported by the indicator showing nearby locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race at 1.30.
The bus left it ten metres from the pedestrian crossing from Easter, just to the barrel where it displays the mileage.
The bags were summarized by the sign with the indicator.
After he left the bus, I hit the marcher ten meters, up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Madam, what does that smell like here?"
I saw she was an old woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the clearing, maybe he's got lambs, I didn't have anywhere to know.
I've been thinking maybe he's going to sting someone with that smelly ugly flesh.
She was trying to pick up a single bag, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified me to take her to the high gate of the market when I took her from the bus," Mihai began to tell the story.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He filled out that the woman didn't say anything at all, and as a result he wasn't even curious to ask her anything.
Until my destination, I didn't speak anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in my car.
And when he took the bags out of the car, I noticed it smells worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I gave two meters back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over and over here, to disappear the smell.
At the bus I didn't notice if it was helped by someone to come down the bags, because I had lights in my back and I didn't see well in the mirrors.
"There were two plastic bags and one of raffia," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says that his curiosity began to grind.
In my mind, I realized something's not right.
After she took her bags down, I went to the hospital, to the Town Hall, and when I came back, I looked especially at what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She had tracked the luggage behind the fence, where are the dumplings inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a bit of agitated because they arrived a minibus from Italy and a bus.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get in them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very agitated, she was walking there and there.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered me that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I'd seen her a while ago.
I looked them up and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I left elsewhere, a race to the Belcești," Mihai completed.
He also told us that the woman was getting agitated after he left the luggage in the dumpsters.
To me, the suspicion left that the luggage had gone missing, and I was curious what he did to him.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed her to me, telling her that I warned her she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around three o'clock when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," the taxi driver concluded.
Prosecutors in Neamt, who investigates the case, say that 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zacharia, was surprised by the cameras of a Roman gas station at 0.55, climbing with the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at Târgu Beautiful at 1:30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then cut him into the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zacharia, and he was an officer in reserve.
Sunday night, the woman put her body parts in two plastic bags, which she carried to the bus, and hid them.
Last night, he transported another one, then decided on what direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid the internal organs of her husband, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a closet in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors did not find out from the woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychologically expertized, and the body will be examined by forensic doctors, in order to officially determine the cause of death and possibly other relevant details.
The Town Hall took over the national roads in the city after years they had been taken over by the Government, in order to be paved with money from the national budget, in the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and in order to be implemented it must be a decision of the Government.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a precondition for this proposal to give the opinion for the Banistic Ur Plan General (PUG).
The town took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment that was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that pass through the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads unless the law is complied with, so we had to approve it.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, it will also have to be issued by the government as a result of this decision of the Local Council," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The national routes that pass the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road beats the Iast on the arteries: the Păcurari road, the Munteni street (to the mafor), the Moara de Fuego, the Silvestru pier, the Silvestru street, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. The springs, the Chisinau road, the Túțora road until the exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albiză.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the road Bucium, bd. Socola (up to the traffic light), the street Bucium (up to the road base 3), the road of Chisinau, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit towards Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Further describing some of Mircea Eliade's "folder" political youth sympathies which, as condensed as they would have presented the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehement charges of the great Romanian scholar.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "anti-legionary", would have to stir up in the Romanian intellectual environment.
In critical analysis of the various versions that spoke of Eliade's registration in the Legion through the "Axa" and Radu Gyr's Cube, Florin Turcanu discusses the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistollary contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "scene of the balcony" of August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the safety investigation in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, Record 573, f.15) as well as on a tracking note in 1938, Florin Turcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in so-called "legionary family" called Luminita, a group of "cuiburi" of intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
As there is no verifiable data about the Luminita nest, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", what must be questioned is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving aside the surprising kindness of the SRI to make these secret dossiers available to Mr.Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the safety pursuit was the "commander" Radu Gyr, mentioning Eliade, in accordance with the note of March 21, 1938, in the context in which Armand Calinescu, the Minister of the Interior had received the free hand to take all necessary steps to enable King Carol to impose his royal dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legions that began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All-All-In-Party for the Country came out in the Third Election of 1937).
Eliade's arrest was carried out following this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a subtle bureaucratic cover for repression in 1938, and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at the retaliation for the vast majority of legionaries or sympathizers active in the public space that were to be arrested, but who were to be bound by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holograph statement mentioned above, given in the arrest in February 1941, after the collapse of the Legionary rebellion, only confirms retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic cover in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had given more details about the content of folder 573 quoted.
Was it Eliade or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it has to be a file built on Security documents anyway, but then processed by Security to be used or against each other.
It is here an equivalent, as in the case of the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that he is a precipitating stage, of proof, in which the one in question behaves as an active sympathizer, in the trial period of three years before becoming "camarad" with acts in good order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or scaffolding, chairs, peasant discussion groups, youth organisations or students gravitated around a nest, were his "family," not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unsuspected reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which can be plausible) understand and use ad litteram to designate the political regiment in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of subtleties of interpretation of this kind cannot conceal the public activity of support of the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether in Nae Ionescu's silage or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean and the political regime itself, as much as, normally, intellectuals of this kind retain a kind of superiority in the face of activists as such and only enter politics when given directly high privileges.
As much as I could think of Eliade's kind of thinking at that time, when he was "the leader of the younger generation," I find it hard to believe he would have accepted the hierarchical rigors of a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
In order not to mention more than in the past, the fact that, in any "directory" legionary, what it receives is antisemitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, however non-existent in the case of Eliade, to us evidence.
As regards the Eliade-Gyr correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin Thurcanu's claims (though based on some archival documents, even if he had deserved more severely dissected and contextualized) with a debatable argument.
Mircea Handoca, in the New volume, found on Mircea Eliade (Bucrești, 2006) that "no part of the correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any allusion to this framework".
Even in 1968, when Radu Gyr was somewhat alive from the communist ocnes, he could not have risked any allusion in a letter which, obviously, was intercepted by censorship.
What I think he wanted to stress is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admirable and affectionate one without any doubt about Eliade's ascendancy.
There really is not even the most pale suggestion that, ever, Radu Gyr would have been head of Eliade.
Intelligent, the poet forced to write at the Glasul Patria, devolves from the top of the place the embarrassing condition by signaling to Eliade (who knew very precisely what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the denigration of right-wing exile), in signature, after "your old friend", to what to expect and is visible easy and happy when it responds affectionately after almost three decades of separation since the "viclean time" alienated them.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been tasked (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could return quietly at least to see his mother and friends) and that he, skillfully, fulfills it dryly and through short sentences, separated from paragraphs, to suggest their foreign body character, Radu Gyr shows no interest except in literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, of refined political complicities suggested or of any mention of the youth years in any register other than the cultural one.
It's hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legionary line, but until this version is strengthened with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Thurcanu, we have in these correspondent memory crutches that testify to a mutual price of characters who have marked different but static, our culture and who, beyond the terrible attempts of life, find the tone of civilization and interbial education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, forging for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the fate of the authors "under the times".
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally renounces refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and the catastrophic floods in the country, announces the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which he carries a sporadic correspondence used to get his sister's passport), that he can't teach the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it is re-indexed, the "Toladot business" is set up in Israel, the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never see their mother again.
Of friends in the country only with Noica still has a sporadic correspondence although, surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of private people or Romanian institutions manage to send her messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write them after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Eliade's second operation of conviction (by official invitations, Noica's proceedings, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed in eternity.
New Coach, Foreign Toys
Due to the shortage of indigenous volleyball, Penicillina Iași tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Departures take part in training tournaments under the command of coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of the A1 Division of Female Flying, Penicillina Iași kept its place in the first sample due to the withdrawal and then the decommissioning of the Science Miroslava band, recently promoted in the first sample after a barrage tournament disputed even in the Municipality of Yemen.
The news took a little unprepared leadership of the outgoing group, who was woken up without principal coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, arrived second to the Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studineanu, or gone, as Ana-Maria Berdilla (at the Volia Alba Blaj champion) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Of course, until the start of the championship scheduled for October 10th, there was also time to complete the lot.
First a new coach was found in the person of Dan Gavril, who came from the men's team LPS Piatra Neamt and who has worked a little in recent years at Penicillina, he wetting to soon sign a contract with the group led by the Left Vasile.
Then were brought two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconiță, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to transferring being the poor player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Penicillin batch led by Dan Gavril performed a cantonment to the Humor's Gura, after which he participated in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with the University of Cluj), but they also suffered two failures, 0-3 with the Lugoj CSM and the Craiova SMU.
Next week, on September 23-25, Penicilina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have a good coach and experienced trainer, but the player fund in Romania is quite low and that's why we're also going to resort to volleyball abroad, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young sports generation from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competitive year on 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult," said the Left Vasile, president of ACS Penicillina Iași.
Exciting meeting.
Twins reunited after almost 70 years
The twin George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their mother of Polish origin had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for her, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from each other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know one about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they didn't find any leads to Lucian.
Just in 2015, thanks to the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the time was one more than exciting.
The BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by the children of the German Open Championship at Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
Five couples from Iasi participated in the Dance Energy Club and danced alongside 9,000 sportsmen from 20 countries.
The 10 outgoing children participated in five different categories (Youth 1, Youth 2, Junior 2, Youth 2 and Amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ştefana Gologan (brown medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy leading places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujba and not last pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ioniţă.
As a coach I really wanted to confirm the results achieved in March this year, this reconfirmation is necessary both for us as teachers and for athletes in terms of their future development.
The fact that we have managed to make the Romanian anthem heard twice this year at German Open and return home with four medals, we are immensely happy and hopeful and confident that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All of these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and much work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, the children's coach at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country on the 4th place of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 ways to get rid of stress in a minute
Too few of us can afford to run a weekend to the mountains to get rid of the stress.
It keeps us some time, others - the finances, and both of them hindrances.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little stress.
These do not involve high costs or special allocated time, according to lyla.ro.
Day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we deal with it and what attitude we take towards it.
Instead of grinding inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Breathe deep
Breathing exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for every man in part, and the regulation of breathing in a tense moment helps to release endorphin in the body, a process that leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child.
We know that we have exceeded the age of childhood and we are not allowed to join when we are in the mood.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office building or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not yell as long as we keep our lungs.
You can get rid of the nerves and the negative energy accumulated over a day with a few whiskers.
Imagine a nice place.
We know that the recommendation sounds worthy of a replica during a psychotherapy session, but it's not often used by psychologists.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detachment from daily frenzy, can lead to attenuation of the nerves.
It is indeed self-sustaining, a process that can even change lives, both in good and in bad.
Everything depends on what we're self-sustaining.
It's best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might encounter difficulties in relaxing.
Listen to even relaxation songs, which are lined and do not contain lyrics, to regain balance at the moment you light the fitile.
Decojiti the orange
Does that sound strange to your advice to peel an orange on your nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it's not about the fruit itself, because it doesn't contain miraculous substances or Xanax to completely disconnect us (sometimes, too total).
It's aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shells, during peeling, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, the hormone of the good state.
Mangaye an animal
Those who have animals around, whether it's the one at home, or it's the one who's bugged next to the job, take a few seconds to mango it.
According to the U.S. National Centre for Infectious Diseases, animal mangaia may decrease blood pressure.
Horre and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with instruments somewhat rival, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combine violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is titled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and from that moment on we were very pleased to sing together, with a virtually unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the time she met a violin with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that we can hear very well what we were singing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things are working".
Each of us has learned from the other's repertoire and, what is very important, it is that the sounds of the two instruments fit.
Florentin: "I know there's a gap between classical music people and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And in the second run we steal another Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who only listen to rock get to like them and classical music.
And I had his surprise telling us at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems formidable to us."
The Iasi students were more in traffic than at school on the first day after the holiday.
Hundreds of exits were yesterday morning "captives" in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The town has announced that the Mangeron Boulevard (splei deli mal left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș, is closing today.
The mayor's chiefs did not respect their promises to carry out work to smooth traffic with the start of the school year.
One of the insurances given to the municipality, at least twice in the last few weeks, was to re-establish the tour in the International Govern ment area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be assembled, and the last deadline for carrying out the work was the end of last week, the tour was not carried out yesterday.
The nerves of the drivers have been extended to a maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the Town Hall was violated: the move of the customs activity of Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "at the latest by the end of August", in the context of which this transfer is still discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the issue at International Station is more complicated.
The rotation will be done at the right time, we have to take into account the traffic of the trams in the area, we also need an opinion from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to remain in turn, but we'll sort it out," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to it, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before the turn.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of the Red Podu.
The car tail on St. Lazarus street stretched to SRI headquarters.
"I've been waiting good minutes to get out in the Red Podu," said one exiter.
By Podu Roș in September they had to drive tramway to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "Development and rehabilitation of the South functional artery" was completed within the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete the initial one.
"I attracted European funds for new works, for example overburdening, on the initial variant Nicolina was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for reintroducing traffic is October.
During yesterday's day, the exits reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
The amnesty might be back as head of the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judicial Council will be kept under judicial control and the prohibitions.
The judges of the Iași Court yesterday resolved a new term in the "Album" file, in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iași County Council.
At the end of yesterday's meeting, the judges decided to rule in the course of tomorrow's day on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Admniţia.
The latter wishes to live or revoke this measure, which has kept him away from the Chief of the JC's seat for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is to be noted by the higher court, Cristian Adomniţia will be able to resume his post as President of the CJ.
Admniţia was sent to court by the National Anticoruption Directorate (DNA), being accused of favoring the perpetrator and forgery after, I say, the pro-chorus, he would have tried to mask an audit check that revealed a series of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The amnesty would have tried to hide the fact that the institution it led would not have received more promotional materials from Iasi county, although scriptically these materials appeared to be received by CJ.
Along with him have been referred to justice and three directors of the CJ, but also the manager of the Laser Co company.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote until 25 September
The city is ready to distribute other questionnaires, if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days left to express their opinion on the replanting of the teas on the foothills of Stephen the Great.
According to the municipal officials, to date some 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed in the neighbourhood centres and three additional points in the city (Codou Park, the Esplanada Alexandru the Good and City Hall).
A record number of exits was presented on Sunday before the Town Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iasseul loves teii", 530 people voted in 140 minutes and nearly four votes each minute.
On the other hand, throughout the month, around 440 exits came to the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many exits claim the inefficient signaling and population of public consultation.
Therefore, they made a call yesterday to Internet users to print an information poster made available by the group and paste it into the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the extra point in Copou Park the last formulations were completed by the exits on Sunday.
We'll offer formulas from the neighborhood centers, where they don't really complete.
"Annual additions will be made when all the 12,000 forms are completed," the municipality spokesman Sebastian Buraga said yesterday.
"Scruts of Teas" will end on September 25th, and if the majority vote of the Saichens is in favor of the replanting of the trees then the Town Hall will plant your silver in this fall.
The exits can express their opinion at the neighbourhood centres in Dacia, Frémoasa, Tătărași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The mayor's chiefs decided to cut the roofs on Stephen the Great at the beginning of 2013, an action that attracted a fine of 60,000 lei municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iasseul loves teii", an online community that includes about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replantation of teas was signed by more than 9,100 supporters until yesterday evening.
RECORD students registered at USAMV Iași!
I'm 920 in year I.
The university has 920 students this year in year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" mentioned that this year were the most successful candidates ever, in the history of the higher education institution, since its establishment.
We are very pleased with the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of candidates admitted to university history, almost 920 students in year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We have also had higher-average candidates, we have occupied our budget positions at the license and master's degree," said Prof. Ioan Tienu, the proctor responsible for teaching.
He also mentioned that the university has registered and a considerable number of tax students, occupying 20% of those places, a figure significantly higher than in other years.
Although the results have also been published in the Romanian study lines, the still continuing admission to the English study program at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has taken out 50 places at the competition, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and now is expected from the ministry on the confirmation of the necessary student files and study visas.
A total of 120 dossiers were submitted at the fall session on 14 budgeted places and 209 on the "tax" basis in the licensing studies.
Most of the files were submitted to the Faculty of Agriculture, number 75, to the Horticulture were 23, and to Zootechnie, 22.
At the master's degree, there were 18 dossiers in the fall session, on the 150 tax seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticultura and six at Zootechnie.
Drivers fear that they will enter with the wheels of the cars into the cracks on Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over the Bay on the Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as screwed up as when the "Zairy of Iași" wrote about the problems they presented 10 days ago.
The reporters of our daily life then signaled that on the axis that delimits the two senses of walking the asphalt was left, defending deep gaps, some even 20 centimeters, by which we see concrete plates that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge.
Also, asphalt began to crack on one side and on the other side of the axis, feeling signs that the depths will accentuate.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to starting a project to rehabilitate the bridge and the tram track, amounting to 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica states that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalled, with rapid work to repair asphalt.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the installation of populaces and a signalling band, without even a simple rain.
During this period, we have focused more on opening the school and the necessary work to this end.
"It's being a pointly expert on the bridge that we're waiting for in about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that in at least two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
Early school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I do not know whether to enjoy myself or to let myself be overwhelmed by melancholy; I lean, passive, to the second variant.
First, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotions, to the garden.
Though it rebounds lightly, no normal parent is happy to raise his children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, the summit, did not end until today.
I wasn't even what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend, even if as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like each of us, I've given all kinds of teachers -- better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or right-handed.
Unfortunately, there are also people with other calls in this breach.
I think these are toxic, because they hurt the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, while I was a student or student, over a few, few, exceptional teachers.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the appropriate time.
Who believes that the role of the cathedral is the banal transmission of information is bitterly wrong.
This can be done by anyone; informed, the student can be very well informed by himself, that we are only living in the age of transparency.
But a good teacher is shaping the minds of the students.
It forms them, it pampers their thinking.
Sitting at the cathedral is not a privilege, as I believe enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very hot, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to look for the hives of those in front of them.
So they dictate age, temper.
In our teens, we all thought we knew everything, that we had unspeakable certainty about everything.
When we grow up, we get to understand that we have nothing but doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to take the teenager out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, she's getting to wonder, ask her questions.
To discover on his own the answers, either the answers or the provisionals.
Get involved in everything he does.
Point him quietly to the profitable models.
It is very difficult, especially that most times the student believes that the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just waiting to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
Now, that directs him, the pure, uncomprehensible, rebellious, to live his fullest calls, to look at the one in the chair with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have how to naturally accept his attempt to order him.
Teenagers are not allowed to be put to a standstill, do not accept to impose restrictions on them.
Or, if they think they do, they get revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when in the cathedral there is a rigid person, who imposes himself by hardness and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the taught object.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data entanglement, that mathematics is all that can be more exhausting for their poor mind.
I always urge my students: if you give it to a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him take you away from the literature to which he should direct you.
How did it happen that I became the teacher myself?
I had a very good teacher in classes VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that spoke to the puber since then on his understanding.
I've met a university professor in high school who opened the door to his library.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had walls of the house covered with bookshelves.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming of having one of them myself.
Now maybe I have it, but if I hadn't gotten my fate out of my way, maybe I'd decide to become a footballer.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or anyone else who knows what.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in hazard.
It is essential to overtake the man who takes your hand and turns you patiently to his own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me just discuss what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be taught.
There is no teacher of literature, as there is math teacher.
How to set the ineffable concepts?
You can, at the very least, approach him without the claim that you are transmitting petrified truths.
The one in the chair can at most guide reading, that's totally different.
But especially may some miraculous encounters take place between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, that can lift them up, it's someone, the soldiers on his eyes.
Therefore, the teacher of literature must first of all be able to make his students understand (to feel) that between literature and life there is no divorce.
On the contrary!
A great treasurer, Al. Paleologu, states one thing only apparent paradoxical: "Sit literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's exactly why a good teacher prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have something to learn.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, it is only by inertia a great truth: not only do the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master, and the student a apprentice.
Which, like any valiant young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few find him, it's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to endure as many separations as possible.

Expanding FIFA's investigation
Justice in the USA and Switzerland will pass on to new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that they will start criminal prosecutions in the case of new people and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
U.S. Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, on Monday, at a press conference in Zurich, that the area of investigations into world football corruption was expanded.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage additional criminal prosecutions for new individuals and organizations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We hope that other people who are being prosecuted will reach the United States," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution had seized several goods, including houses and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"We didn't even get to the end of the first round," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terrabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
To the attention of the investigators, a contract for the surrender of media rights to the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil also entered into.
FIFA faces a great corruption scandal, after the US justice has put 14 people on charge, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven foremen.
The retained people are researched for bribery and receiving other benefits from the early 1990s to date, totalling more than $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swissman Joseph Blatter announced in early July that he was resigning as president of FIFA after being re-elected for the fifth time.
Fighting like in movies at the theater
In the Supekombat gala from Milan, the exit Cătalin Morosanu will fight with the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătalin Morosanu, will participate on October 2nd in the Superkombat gala from Milan's 4th Ciak Linear Theatre, the last before the November final, is shown in a press release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as promised, we will return this fall with a new five-star gala.
If we've still chosen a place of unprecedented conduct, a theatre, then we promise to fight like in movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event schedule.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated celebrities, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full program," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Moroşanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with the American James Wilson, known after having participated in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and the numerous awards from the bodybuilding concussions.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I saw Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the finals, so now I'm gonna take revenge on him.
"From beast to cat," Moroşanu said.
Undefeated in 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers in Italy will have the last confrontations before fighting for world titles on November 7 in the final sea.
Last year, they both went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I'm just waiting to meet the fans there and I promise them a new performance of unforgettableness," World Champion Andrei Stoica also said.
La Milano will fight and Raul Cartinaș with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her birthday, but she also argued in the letter
A little girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for the longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter did not remain without echo, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for her invitation, but she also apologized that she could not be present on September 27, so she really hated having fun with her family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of the heart.
Adrian Păunescu's destiny and Vadim Tudor's destiny is similar.
Both of them were writers and politicians and both of them died out at the nearest age, from the heart.
Adrian Paunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, on a TV reality show.
In a verb, Vadim Tudor ironized Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the tourism minister at the time, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Paunescu with a smile on his jokes, "I'm envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
I caught him smiling, and he said to him, "It's not too commendable what you told me now."
Adrian Paunescu died on 5 November 2010 at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, 14 September 2015, at the age of 65.

Syrian Artist Turns Super Mario into a Refugee · Global Voices
A Syrian artist created a refugee version of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the difficult situation of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of the Funerals, the modified video game has its center on the "Mario Refugee".
The person is trying to get past human traffickers and border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with the refugee Mario after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At Craiova Detention Center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I, and the oldest one is 25 years old and is in Class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I have chosen to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Prison Administration to try to draw attention, and in this way, to lesser-known realities.
The youngest 15-year-old student is enrolled in Class I and the largest 25-year-old and is enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned to discuss at this point, we are all pressed by our own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Center offer," said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday at the opening of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedy, stating that the young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could have followed the natural school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but and receive a set of moral values, learn what law enforcement means and what consequences it can have on its failure.
"The role of the penitentiary system is not to permanently isolate from society the people who have violated the law, to shut them behind high walls, but to try to revive and prepare them, so that when they return in the midst of the community to have more chances of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases the conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are over 2000 graduates of school education.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight what hasn't been done for 25 years, but there are important steps that we're taking.
"In all these ways we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and are not a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice has welcomed the success of both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Rise of the Holy Cross, I would launch all the students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of the Soveja, Mărăști and not only, to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiars to be dismantled!
Petition of prestigious universities in Iași and the country
Over 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society in which they request the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even disband doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic taxation".
Among the signatories of the petition launched on 10 September are teachers and teachers from Iași.
Among the university signatories of the Yemen academic petition is, for example, Prof. Liviu Antonesa.
At the national level, the petition has names from former Ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, cultural people who are also academic professionals, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Act provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been done so far, resulting in the absence of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that are in flagrant violation of ethical rules in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance", is stated in the petition.
The petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Law, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where more than two plagiars have been found, until the assessment and remediation of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there is no minimum number of doctoral directors provided by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility to grants of IDEI-like projects.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?
"Why are there no other academics in Europe who give doctoral degrees organized by secret services, and the top military who give their doctoral degree do it to autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, the petition's initiator, and she from Iasi.
This can be completed by all the wishers on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The party "For Iași", founded by young managers of political non-affiliated IT, was launched yesterday in Copou Park.
Chairman of the Iasi Initiative Group gave an interview to the Iasi district
The Jaşul will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of political unaffiliated entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched at the end of last week the Iasi Party that will propose candidates to the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the party's core is made up of IT specialists, but the group's initiators say that everyone who wants to be involved in modernizing the city is welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and over 200 sympathizers attended the event, almost all of them being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicuchor Dan, president of the Bucharest Rescue Association.
He was the surprise of the local elections in 2012, when, from his independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of the happy ones for the position of mayor of the capital.
"The people I've seen at "For Iasi" think they're very good at accessing the public administration of Iash."
I believe in this initiative, I believe it has a chance, I think it may have more chances in a community smaller than the one in Bucharest.
"I will always be with Iasi," Nicusor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn’t you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more sentimental and emotional.
I've been on many short business trips, I've lived a year in Cluj.
I've come back every time, because I've felt here's my house.
ZDI: Why have you decided now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have started to know each other for a while.
We met in a professional context, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more shy in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved naturally and organically, and now it's happened to be the time when we came to the decision that we need to get more involved than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimization of the activity of the town hall so that the various departments, institutions and kings can cooperate as well.
But more importantly, we can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, it is important to consult the public of the people affected.
If we talk about efficiency, we should not forget public transportation, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be bought.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city counts extremely much.
How would you promote Jaşul?
Andrei Postolache:Get on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What is the brand of Jaash?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a city of technology, one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go into medicine, enter robotics, into 3D printing, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here to the modern city brand.
Of course, Jaşul already has a historic brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and running projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we're going to talk to everyone, we're not just staying on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have volunteers wearing the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are plenty of people like that.
ZDI: Iast Mayor should be more concerned about promoting the city's image nationally and internationally, or is it necessary for the area of concerns to be always of an editorial nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your city known, if you don't attract money into the city, at some point you'll run out of money and you won't be able to make, for example, streets.
You have to do both at the same time and you need competent people next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor-tutuch, who comes and knocks with his fist in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract IT-area businessmen to the party who can financially support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an unfaithful reputation, to be clear to the integrity and to be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, Introspecials established its company, after seven years as Director of the International Endava (2008 - 2015) where it coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent them in Synygy.
The company that it has established alongside another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla Tractor Program has proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said the program to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural cars, initiated in 2011, called Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to the bureaucracy.
Linked to the Rabla Programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program he managed to sell somewhere to 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to it, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very big competition with those who come from outside, all the world producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things I have told you, and they have special policies.
"At all fairs there is a large crowd, all producers expose, come with the whole type of variant," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Rabla tractor program, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as the combinations, could hand them over and instead receive a voucher worth 17,000 lei.
Red Flag Uped
The internal scrutiny of Labour seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes his spearhead in the upcoming elections.
Raise up, therefore, the red-lit flag/ Under his laps we will live and die.
That was yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn in London's Sanctuary House pub.
He has witnessed many facts and vows/ Let us not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left anthem (The Red Flag/ Red Flag) can search it online and would not be excluded to have a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear/that we'll wear it until we collapse.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and of those who fly them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to unite the left of yesterday with the one of tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party's base will be part of a happy end.
I don't think this will happen, but it seems premature to talk about the sea and the inevitable electoral defeat, in five years' time, of a leader chosen from the other day.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive size.
British Labour has not invented the system of direct voting for the party's leader, left-wing.
The French Socialists have been practicing a more complicated system for several years, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the appointment of the presidential candidate in 2012.
However, the internal election of the Labour seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes his spearhead in the future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, with the personalization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the Channel.
In addition, participation in the vote was high in all three "circles": the members themselves, the members of the trade unions and other organizations affiliated to the party and, finally, the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot paper after a summary registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially those of young and middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to get even more involved in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn’s victory.
There are no sociological investigations to tell us too much about the attitudes of this Labour "external search", so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we are seeing a lot of attitudes similar to those of the sympathizers Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will travel through the traditional channels of the left.
If we tend to identify a vocation "anti-system", it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of much-healing thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go far enough to the left, that they did not delimit themselves firmly from the time of Tony Blair.
The second point - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we abstain from the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations for other political issues, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments favourable to the social state and animated by the aspiration of equity, followers of disarmament and hostile military involvement abroad, but also sensitive to new left-wing themes: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish workers have thus lost an electorate to whom they should have, at least in principle, privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Such energies exist everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership could not attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation of outsider, has more chance of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrat" Labour.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I believe, than with the left anti-system in the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we will learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as leader of the opposition.
We'll see if the Red Flag will also rise in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader takes over the place, first of the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn wants now from his colleagues in Parliament is first and foremost unity - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without good science
While I wrote the article, I thought about the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" becoming part of the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin's person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could itself make me from the start circumspect).
I didn't.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel two pictures - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and the one, in fact: the two looking at Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh we took it from the article "Syrian fighters come with the wave of refugees" (signified by Viorica Marin in Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a sleeve draw from the friend (not just by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, but a clarification. Laith of Saleh is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he is a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate the grossolan in the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt bad.
As much as I wrote the article, I thought about the story of the former fighter and the "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" becoming part of the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin of his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - were able to make me from the start circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
Instead, I had no other comment on Marius Cristian's sleeve than that: "So I have to trust in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the story in cash and I owe it to readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found in a material of the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among hundreds, maybe thousands of refugees, a man who tried to make order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was the Syrian fool Laith Al Saleh from Aleppo who "is usually in charge," since he "run a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian Civil War".
We also know that Al Saleh, 30 years old, had "a home, a wife and a normal life before the battle began that cost more than 250,000 lives and put on the road a third of Syria's population".
In the interview with the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh says that "everyone wants to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous urbes in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
Beyond being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "A couple of days ago, I saw a sniper from government forces."
I haven't talked to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also find that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to Holland, where he has a cousin - he was a superior officer in the Syrian army and then became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and then bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (about an age with the civil war in Syria, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was achieved, Laith Al-Saleh would not have ruled out a return to Syria to continue the struggle for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
An insanity - anyone who wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy, but three!
I've already discovered a Serbian material from August 22nd, from which I didn't understand very much, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: TERRISTS GET KRIJU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news article on http://www.telegraf.rs/vest, in which a picture of Al Saleh with beard holding a Syrian flag in his hand and that refugee wearing the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On September 7, then, himself on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation with the help of photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS figter posing as a refugee - This viral photo claims wrong that it portrays a Islamic state fighter posing as a refugee.
We find that the photo (in fact: pictures - the one with Laith with beard and gun and the one with THANK YOU) was posted by a user on Facebook, who user would be and apologized in the meantime.
Only before that, only on his wall, the image of the two photos would have been shattered more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse had gone!
In Romania, on September 9 Carla Dinu de la Hotnews takes over the story with the manipulation of the BBC, while translating the wrong title: "A fake photograph turned viral shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, not photography is false, but interpretation was false, wrong, in short: manipulative.
