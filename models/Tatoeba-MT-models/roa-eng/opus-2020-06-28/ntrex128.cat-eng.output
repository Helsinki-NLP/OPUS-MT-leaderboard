Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that "they identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed dismay at the proposed amendment of their title for MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly for the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a mockery.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remains with Twp or Pwp."
For readers who are not Welsh: in Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the party's whole "doesn't see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member claimed that his group was "open" in the face of the change of name, but he also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a manner similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifier to name the members of the assembly will, of course, fall on the members themselves."
The Wales government's 2017 Law grants the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly for the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was decanted by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received wider support for the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to reach consensus can be a complete misappropriation for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their designation during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of name of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided on an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a way to reclaim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the change in name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way to socialize today," he says.
"Bars have stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people used to go periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that gets from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict "and that sooner or later return to the place where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who won't be of any help to the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of white race," he says, "and so what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, as it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the church of Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to 125th Street retailers, one of Harlem's leading shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, that was when they ordered the cart.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and successor to the church of St. Martin's, described the wagon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who made the cartoon sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and a " irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the world's first trailer that was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest rail of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "tends to transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to look for lobsters in California on the first day of the August season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been snooping with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's cries for help, and then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that first he thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized he was yelling 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!'
He had all the cracked clavicle," Hammel observed when he came to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was airborne at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in a serious state.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, assistant Larry Giles commented that a few weeks' work had been detected by a shark in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic wounds at the top of the torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to the investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans towards the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, SuperDrug, and Debenhams with beauty product aisles like large busy stores with skilled employees.
These big halls are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves about GBP 28 billion and continues to grow as fashion and household products fall behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tried to expand to more shops next year if the test becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products is a product of supermarkets' greed to take advantage of the space in their shelves that were previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that he will double his offer of beauty to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Esseise, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique make-up products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanded aspect by younger consumers.
The minority chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two shops in Sainsbury's, the first one last week in Croydon, South London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller amounts every day in small supermarkets has made big supermarkets find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly look like large stores in an attempt on the supermarket chain to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing points of sale from Argos to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch the sale of groceries and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up hasty in not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after sale three years ago by Sainsbury's from his 281 drugstore business in Celesio, the LloydsPharmacy chain owner, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury leather brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, into four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments, "We've turned the look of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment in front of our customers.
We've invested in trained workers specifically who will be of great help in providing advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby backs a GBP 11 million deal
The Dragon Star's Den Peter Jones left "furious" after the television host Holly Willoughby pulled back from a GBP 11 million deal with Jones's brand-of-life business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate himself to the business set of home products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones infuriated by retreating in the last minute of the lucrative brand-style business set to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new bidder's agreements, valued at GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the joint brand of household products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future and where we would see him for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to turn back left all the parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods at their Marlow power station ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the significant investment that had been made in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and clothing for home, and the possibility of delays in their launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in taking the position of president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We will not comment on your business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about possible criticism from the media to make a comment that some would consider "a president's own" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up on this?
Trump said, mocking the voice of a news presenter:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations towards denuclearisation, however, are stagnated.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "correspondence response" from the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s point of view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare the war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we maintain this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of tests with missiles, help to free hostages and return home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to dating Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this place full of people, we would have about 200," Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths from a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, there was no declaration of any kind of national disaster required to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so that the situation is quite demanding," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not safe for foreigners to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters have been built in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other shores.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element in his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railroads.
However, Joko's government is facing next year's re-election loaded with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative fall faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of fighting in the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with machetes, arches and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is the goal of the draw with a distant kick in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at 89th on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea Porteria when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible kick directed to the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a high elevation as it propelled to the right side of the porter.
The ball finally started the descent over an Arrizabalaga Kepa in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a touch, and I didn't think about it much, I just dedicated myself to kicking."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at a break after scoring a goal per minute 25 through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
On the move, the Blue team's lead returned from the heel a pass in Mateo Kovacic before he was tossed from almost half the field and sprinted into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle field.
Then he made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard passed the defense to finish the second suit with a kick with his left leg where he couldn't reach the doorman of the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Naples in the group phase of the Champion League next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to reports from the country's disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the crash of the collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman in a press conference.
The city of Palu, of more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruin of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbing woman
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the locals to see or hear something about the crime that they're facing the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statements: "Although the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to call everyone near John Street at Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I'd also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to pick up anything through the car's onboard camera, get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman the body they found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
While continuing investigations, the police have commented that they are reporting on the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he learned what had happened, he ran out of words.
He's warning residents that it's gonna be hours before they can get back in.
He could feel like a police officer telling a man that the whole area is treated like the crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the arranged area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the arranged area controlling the block of floors.
Any person who may have information that sends a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers by 0800,555 111 and mentioning file 247 of 30 September, is asked to contact us.
Cromwell's statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion about "rewriting history."
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "forestry" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the main goals.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing Cromwell wrongly for his forefather's actions he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy to be commemorated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer · Global Voices
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, uniquely identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pork court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday in the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cattle into pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from Yunnan's neighboring province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to a nearby pork court.
He said there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that 250 kg of garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as mentioned on the news of Guiyang's evening.
The security camera scenes show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by either Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders commented on the evening news that the pig was kept locked up and isolated in order to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been previous cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with severe wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "unchaining."
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of hurting.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the entire southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it advances over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
Rosa had 138 km/h winds, typical of a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Eastern US time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity northward toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave Monday to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate generalized torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in large part of Arizona.
There is a possibility that there will be rivers, as the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the scattered character of tropical rains.
It is completely unadvised to enter the desert on foot in front of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the throats to become uncontrolled rivers, and the storms can lead to wind and dust clouds at particular points.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations of more than 50 mm may be recorded, which may result in flows of minor wastes and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They will start to arrive isolated tropical rains in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several major temperature oscillations across the U.S. as the Arctic cooled down, although the Tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can lead to dramatic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the hot October will begin in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Planes area to parts of the north-east.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many chances of temperatures above average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate for Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was broadcast to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a shift in events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee about judicial matters that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators saw this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average of viewers of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Audience numbers were not immediately available for other chains that transmitted the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, this is a hearing similar to that of an American football playoff party or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who have clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most audienceed chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the testimony of a whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest stays high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was increted by protesters when he was trying to get an elevator to go to a court hearing.
Flake stayed a few minutes with the sight shot down while being taken live on TV at CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't!"
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before they closed the elevator doors, he said he'd have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all the cable and broadcasting chains were already broadcasting live by the time the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not it was going ahead with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate to vote on it.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nomination face-to-face next week, condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had influence, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, the former foreign affairs minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers' plan for Brexit, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect each other's taxes is "absolutely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, 20-year-old basketball player who was militating the LSU team.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison charged with second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and claimed that they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS WAFB's branch.
After interrogating Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had died of a gunshot wound, according to the police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to counsel.
The East Baton Rouge District Forensic's office published a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the operating group of fugitives from the Louisiana state police, the state police forensics lab, Southern University police and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that has culminated in this arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the local law enforcement forces for their "diligence and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
Half a mile away, he was playing the game and he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on LSU's team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team's basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A Ash Spike in Mexico City
The ash sprained by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after crater activity was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several recent shocks and tremors.
Images of social media where a thin layer of ash is appreciated in car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence faced riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote in Catalonia over their secession.
A group of independenceists detained by the riot police began throwing eggs and powdered paint, which caused dark clouds of dust to appear in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later on the same day, beatings took place with the police, who used their leashes to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, let's not forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independenceist mentality one year after a referendum was held on October 1, considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a very large majority, although the participation rate was low, as the opponents of the secession boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by entering the electoral colleges across the region, causing violent clashes.
The independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independentist demonstration along with his wife, said that he no longer had many hopes for Catalonia to achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy about being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital victory, although by a limited margin, in the autonomic elections last December, Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is filming the demonstration of support to the police on his phone, claiming that the conflict has been revived by the politicians on both sides.
"Tension only increases," she says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the next year's European Parliament.
"Presenting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Arrested men after covering up a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, have been arrested after a car repeatedly invests against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Bob Blemmings says they were damaged at the gates and in the same building.
It's also possible that at some point someone fired a bullet at the car.
A Menga game gives Livingston 1 to 0 victory in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was victory
Livingston, who had climbed a category this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the club in the Ibrox neighborhood.
Dolly Menga's move made a difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second place, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrards, on the other hand, continue to win out of the house at the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends up to six parties his invincible stump to the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston doesn't take his chances in front of a direct visitor's game.
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, as their direct game caused all sorts of trouble in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson paved the way between the defense, but he wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the porter, then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out on the stretch to try to finish Craig Halkett's boss past, who crossed the porter.
The locals were good at letting the Rangers get closer to their area, knowing that they could put the visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how that decisive goal came.
The referee whistled a flaw against Rangers' interests and Livingston opened up to the side, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could touch it first and finish it from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but found himself with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the party,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop on credit.
For his part, Rangers Carrier Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion of Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination play from Livingston.
The Rangers dedicated themselves to hanging once and for all in the Livingston area just to be rejected, and two criminal charges were claimed, one for a supposed entrance of Halkett to the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for each other.
Livingston "phenomenal": Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they keep overcoming all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His game style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immensely in charge of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's tail throughout the party.
Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the brilliant moments shown with Gerrard as coach, they definitely didn't know how to keep the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly passed the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Sweet reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear heavens on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it is that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police allied security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also felt while condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero to some German Turks and a dictator for others.
Traffic accident at Deptford: A cyclist dies when he meets a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the border of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 local time.
The vehicle driver stopped and, although the paramedic services cared for the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a run-in case at Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said that their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to close relatives.
The street has been cut off and there have been deviations for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded agents in an altercation
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation at this high-security men's penitentiary, according to the downtown office.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still remains.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight prisoners were seen to be involved. The trouble could be contained on one side.
The agents had to be cared for by slight wounds in the face at the scene.
According to a prison spokesman, "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve a continuing incident in Long Martin Prison.
Six employees had to be cared for with injuries.
We're not gonna tolerate violence in our prisons, we're clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to report back to the police and they might have to spend more time in jail."
There are over 500 inmates in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be cared for in a hospital after being attacked by a recluse.
In addition, in October of last year, riot officers took note of the presence in prison to solve a serious altercation in which center staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (the drought areas could benefit)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's precisely what's likely to happen in the early weeks of the week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to arrive directly on Tuesday in Phoenix and to approach the night of Monday with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have kept the state of storm or tropical depression on a 322 km radius from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm of the Arizona Mogolon would be recorded.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of risk of rivers, the rain of the rose could become a great news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of Arizona's state is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The rose continued to have hurricane power on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So it's expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of rivers.
According toweather.com, "expect from 75 to 150 mm total rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility that it will reach 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach south of Utah well into the night of Tuesday.
"The main risk we expect of Rosa or what remains of him is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, plus landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some kind of mobile phone event recording will contact you.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered the petty anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection to the ruthless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "beaten the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual abuse of her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in court in connection with his plea.
The president said on Saturday that, that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizenry," he commented to the crowd of West Virginia sympathizers.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voters' participation index in the elections in half the term.
"We are five weeks away from some of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually going," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicating themselves to "resist and obstruct."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place as very late as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant of Republican party leaders.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in Palu when waves of up to six metres hit the coast towards sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, smashed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency, where the number of shops and destroyed buildings is appreciated, bridges turned and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued shaking this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the heavy Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb fired at Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 misplaced.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damages could rise on the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and so no information came from Donggala," says Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting on the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said that the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media fan, you can feel like a man sitting on the top floor of a building giving desperate warnings to street people about the tsunami approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water erupted near the sea, taking up buildings and vehicles.
Reuters couldn't immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a generalized cut in the electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuated people are still desperately in need of food, along with other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll for the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the employees settled in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseva says.
“They told me that they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although the aid groups made the desolate gesture of initiating the relief work, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provision and staffing of foreign staff can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared."
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday fell in Palu, friends and relatives of the disappeared people kept hoping that the miracle and its loved ones would come out of their misery story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue teams freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandage, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the parapentist community, he had desperately sent messages for WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Some thieves take $26,750 while filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the vehicle driver was emptying the ATM into the entertainment facility and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of involvements in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renamed to Ye
Rat Kanye West is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: “To be formally known as Kanye West.”
In West, 41 years old, he was moved by his nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before they appear in the Saturday Night Live program, in which they are expected to present their new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation as "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible, and the Bible means you," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio host.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without a dash and in upper case letters.
Mexico’s President, AMLO, Promises Not to Use Military Force Against Civilians · Global Voices
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is left for the country to fulfill the 50th anniversary of a cruel retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student left-wing movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities,
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they devote to research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialising in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government have announced IA-related measures, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number one for innovation in AI in 2030.
“Duplicate the budget for research in AI would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next breakthroughs in the AI field,” pointed Lee.
“Dualising funding could double US opportunities for the next major breakthrough in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that surpassed Othello's US player with the best ranking and later served as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee positively valued previous technology competitions from the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would be held to identify the next visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the US task in the AI field could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residency cards to doctors at AI," he added.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public bodies in the United States give money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China," Lee pointed out.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve partners in the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a US$2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the Natural Sciences Foundation is concerned, it currently spends more than 100 million USD a year on research in AI.
Meanwhile, no measures have been implemented for months in relation to US legislation that aimed to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name in the North Republic of Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the population of most of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign questions whether the minimum 50% participation is required for the referendum to be valid.
The question given in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that were created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have expressed that it will comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered persons voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Macedonia's referendum on the change of name of the country, which would pave the way for membership of the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by the people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our head high, not the back door,” Kavadarkov explained.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can resort to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev said that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian network Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% declared that they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the pro-Western government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City, scores a goal after regattaing all the Brighton defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory by 2 to 0 at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal a minute 65 in a play that looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He marched by speed between three Defenses of Brighton, sweeping with what was passing him to the ground of play.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He raided a defense before overtaking a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton's porter, Mathew Ryan, with a kick that sneaked inside the network on the right side.
"Agüero is having foot trouble," said Pep Guardiola, a City coach, to journalists.
“We have decided that I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth in the Brighton field and
He made a beautiful leap into space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before she passed it to Sterling in the long stick.
The Sky Blues front finished the ball inside the network before it got off the bottom line.
The City faces Hoffenheim Tuesday in part of the Champions League group phase at 18:55 hours at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there wasn't much reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go out on Sunday's pitch against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep a lead match on Los Angeles Dodgers at the West National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a comedian with the 5 to 2 victory against the Nationals Friday night, but they still seek their first title of division.
"Even if we don't play anything, we can at least throw out knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer drop if this situation goes down.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing shuttle has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike clearances in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, big ones, I don't introduce myself, but actually I do present myself, so I'm fighting everywhere for the great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, they see their pettyness, their bad intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats' mission, he said, is "to resist and obstruct."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he answered, and called the Democrats "enraged, mean, dirty, and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic Senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, who provoked a strong crowd.
“Remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
Wait a minute... this was an expression of very bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party must cease to be a diverse party.
It's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he manifested himself with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues with which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The warning of Friday's meeting of the Nottingham Labor Party said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It is increasingly obvious that divergent views are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as you colleagues with whom I previously thought I was sharing a similar political vision were hoping that I would make a 180o turn and take positions I would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages that call for my candidacy not to be renewed, central politics are reported, and I'm told it shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who have to face every day a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't get angry.
One of the disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how normalized the level of abuse has been.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “non-confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party became more strenuous.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice and recommended that I keep my head down, that it wasn't so expressive, and that everything would be fine.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student age, stimulated by Thatcher's neglectful government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local advisor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr immaculate leaders
Two last-minute trials distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant game of Tennent's Premiership day.
The Ayr, who are the only team immaculate of the ten, occupy the top position at the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they were better able to take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still getting hit, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulation for the Ayrs has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's essay in minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for the international Scottish Rory Hughes, relinquished by the Warriors party, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayr with a sanction and, right in the middle of it, wrote down and turned a test to put the marker 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party was interrupted for a long time because of the severe injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which retreated into a bunk bed, and at the rebound the Ayr extended the distance again with a essay by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then the alternate captain Blair Macpherson was admonished with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvina at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plate on Climo without a ball, from the sanctions alignment, MacPherson noted a rehearsal behind the penetrating mole of the Ayrs.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a kick from David Armstrong and put the ball on the third line to Gregor Henry to write down the fifth round of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the inn after he has been found to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis's character in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-stars Greg Hemphill, his comic couple for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the “flowering restoration sector” of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coastline, hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol through their ship's stalemate in La Paz.
Public buildings are a flag of sea blue.
The naval bases from Titicaca Lake to Amazonas are fraught with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Across the landless territory of Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, waits with a positive posture for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution on large screens across the country, hoping the Hague Court will dictate in favor of the Bolivian claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a polemic battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes deposited in the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia and that if it does, things will not change much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which only takes place six months after the final allegations were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law specialist.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate pointed out.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crusade.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a quimera to think that the US's continued sanctions and objection to a statement ending the Korean War could make North Korea never kneel.
Washington distrusts accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not make important disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the issue of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only means of ensuring its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of big hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the passageway a range of extravagant hats of disproportionately sized dimensions of their SS19 collection, which enthralled the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been crushed by very little practical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated bib hat, adorned with a broad wing, shaped like a feather, which flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled syndria, a hat of sorcerer and even a pinnae, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of amazing masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than no tall seam.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tube and glasses, while another looked like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
Big hats step on the heels of the “bomb,” a two-foot wide straw hat, which everyone has brought from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread across social networks brought another great creation to the passageway: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in bather that wore it.
The bag of raffia, of dark orange color, adorned with raffia saws and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection The Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags in the main streets the next summer. Considering that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language Competences Are Essential for World Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, career choices and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable matter of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we are to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages obtained the A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice class, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons for employers’ difficulties in filling vacancies were attributed to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Because there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such permanent competition.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing different languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on modern, more traditional languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he can always choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which have trained staff who specialize in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future is.
In today's global trading environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of vital importance to the country's future, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative powers".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do this.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
He's practically finished waiting for fans who want to watch LeBron James play his first match with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes he's going to play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walt said at the Lakers’ official site.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James is probably going to play a few minutes.
After this week's early training, James was asked about his plans for the six-party Lakers pre-season calendar.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he replied.
Trump's Match to West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump scheduled rallies for the next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court is pending, Trump seeks support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally at Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7pm today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via YouTube live video transmission.
Trump is likely to approach the hearing that began this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense due to the sexual abuse charges he is facing, while the Senate's anticipated confirmation vote remains pending until a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans in the sensitive November elections to get a boost.
Therefore, the five Trump presidential campaign rallies scheduled for the next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as important for your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a busy campaign season,” pointed out a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together sympathizers "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second time visiting West Virginia, the state where he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results from the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to push him into the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows their ambition to keep the hopes of the individual Sunday parties alive
After three unmatched sessions, Saturday afternoon ants were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dynamic tilting pendulum is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So whose side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little bit of a positive fit," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little bit in their favor and have many reasons to be encouraged, largely by the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both count on three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is setting an example.
The celebration Gutural screams rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put in a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been down two after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar scream, of the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to do your utmost and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed feeling of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday evening, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow into and from the bullying public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at once in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles to the first nine holes sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never had a chance to get out of.
Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see from the interactions between the matings, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing Saturday's furballs and ants with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, up to now, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, mastered by Thomas Bjorn, who was aspiring to keep the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an unsecured American team in morning furballs and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the ants and won two games, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who gets four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who wins four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed at the forts, they called a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sparks, but lost 19 of 29 matches in furballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning football, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything in its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a landmark on Saturday for Americans achieving two points.
They won a two to one victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for four to three in the fours, after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in Ryder Cup's story a team had made a four-point difference to individual parties, although Furyk's title advocate just needs to tie up to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a Sunday counterattack coming is out of reach.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in no way" if no signs of confidence are appreciated.
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on Saturday to the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global organization that North Korea had taken "important steps of good will" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test centre and committing itself to not proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any response in US consonance,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as he took action gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, as well as opposing the "war end declaration," pointed Ri.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a quimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the denuclearization issue was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that pointing to the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim of "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened to “destroy completely” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much remains to be done and sanctions remain until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia maintain that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: “The application of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and final denuclearization.”
The Security Council has launched sanctions in North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not very good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying they had made progress, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own demands for a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in line".
He said Kim had told him that the "measures in consonance" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight culture, increasingly extended, to study throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students at the world’s number one university are often unnoticed by what goes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why are you telling me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts of how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, said the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, dolls and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily path.
“We know that the conduct of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," pointed Professor Czesler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and the growing pressure students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever greater problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a mode of inanimation and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to conduct a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which is another stumbling block outside.
Ibrox's set sought to add his first victory at home from the triumph of last February for 4 to 1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerard in 18 matches as coach to leave his team drifting, at 8 points from Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the score.
While the Rangers now fall into the sixth square, Livingston goes to third position, behind Hibernian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face even more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently flung from the ranks.
Gerard made eight changes to the alignment that swept the Ayr into the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same 11 headline who took out a point against the Hearts last week, probably feeling satisfied with the way his team, well organized, choked their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored at the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sucked out and wasted the great occasion.
Keaghan Jacobs' blunt defeat hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only kicked himself in the back pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a criminal at the signal of the 15 minutes, since he and Steven Lawless met, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to carry the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no trouble with the Lassana Coulibaly's boss and the Docile Ovie Ejaria's front.
While the first act of the Livi the minute 34 could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' hard work.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard acted on the pause when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had an impact almost immediately, as the end made a pass in Morelos, although the imposing Kelly rushed to the lockdown.
However, Livingston continued to get the attention of visitors playing exactly the way they like it, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long passes, one after the other.
Holt's gang could have given the address to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow took a break from the horn.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still demanded a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made big eyes.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day that the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as a Geiger counter.
The count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed physicists:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can listen to the effects of atoms emanating from mineral radioactivity."
Evans: "You're sure it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can see a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells, altering them in the lab to be able to see a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then reinjecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.: "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 protein "promotes the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West branched into a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was scribed to the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After his third night song, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a cap from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and to reiterate his support for Trump.
"When I talk to white people, they say, "How do you like Trump if he's a racist?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee for complaints of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it didn't come out, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's disapproval tape to social media.
It's not clear if Rock meant to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that it was not well treated behind the scenes because of its hat.
"I was threatened behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," said Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he would wear the Superman layer, because so they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do.
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public's shouts at least twice, and members of the program team seemed ashamed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained in the post: "The whole study was completely different."
West behaved as a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience puzzled by the interpretation of Perrier's song and Love it, disguised as a bottle.
West received support from the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits: THANKS TO RETURN BETWEEN THE MULTITUD."
But the presenter of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the first known being as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, used to be called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of the Prince music changed its name to a symbol and later the artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following the stabbing of a man Friday east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear in front of the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The throne game star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for representing the role of the Jon Snow swordsman in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the hero virile stereotype by asserting that these roles give the understanding that young boys often believe that they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times magazine Culture, Kit said that he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old throne game co-protagonist Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has a lot of determination to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What do you teach on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
'Cause there's definitely something wrong with young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's sick of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will feature a repositioning of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his couple Rose is the best thing he's ever given him Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character Kit represents, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple contracted a marriage in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health agents.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were 40,000 new cases declared.
The vast majority of new cases are sexual transmission, unlike what used to happen.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health agents at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT collective is commonplace.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, China's government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from Senators of the Republican Party and disassembles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of the Wikipedia of legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claimed that the demands were driven by criticism and far-right websites.
"Minds, lies, and more contemptible lies," Waters stated in a statement on Twitter.
Allegedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate committee on sexual abuse complaints against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and revealing information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
"This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised by these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this leaking information.
This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
The Waters statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the White House ex-secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
You must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who stood to overthrow Waters in the mid-term election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed every member of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's limited spy parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this repositioning of Johnny English's parody of action-comedia franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, not an exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how contemptible we are will be a new opportunity to export the country?
In any case, the incompetent of outgoing eyes and face of rubber Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquat glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point from Mr. Bean and a touch from this guy who brings a single note to the topic of Firecars at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now forgotten television commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last trip of JE.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the blades of the propeller were dripping on his helmet.
You see Atkinson's gift to physical comedy, but humor seems rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now already include comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seems destined for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as the silent gags of the character Mr. Bean representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which is causing the Service Officer's dismay, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last appeal for a prime minister who is a pretensive and besieged figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her the best of herself with this character engraved by Teresa-May, but the script does not come any further.
His intelligence advisors inform him that as every active spy puts himself in danger, he'll have to get back a retired spy.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but teaching off-the-shelf classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gigs, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his dry sufferer Bough, a paper that re-represented Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin when things get really ugly in Her Majesty's secret service go into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletinva.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic billionaire technology who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous crazy things: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a fast-eating French restaurant, they seem to be smuggling chaos on board Volta and English luxury yachts provokes a great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been pulled out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all looks like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
Like with the other films of Johnny English, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role to bring justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and to cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and will charge five days.
Allegedly, the party wants business leaders to pass the savings obtained from the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they received the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a week works four days with the support of trade union confederacy Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party stated in The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits into the party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint way at the present time.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "spectulators" in public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shade also imply that water business shareholders might not recover all the investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes I perceived.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers in company joints and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms' shares to employees, who expect to embed annual dividends at a value of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question as to whether the agency's findings could influence a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could shed light on something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I'm serious," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was strong, determined and safe."
But Graham's vote seems etched on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would file an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's happened, but I know this: Brett denied it roundly," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people who name will be able to verify it.
He's 36.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that features an absolutely impressive star program, which carries out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in Central Park's Great Lawn area not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken the awareness of the global goal of ending the extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to actively fight it.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless anyone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way of persuading them to demand a call to action or just a case more than we call "clickivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are comparable to more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and advertisements derived from their actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that for the time being, the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and realizers based in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and promises to send 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, in the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website asking, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and hard road, and sometimes we're going to fall and miss.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing at the New York New York Winter Event, presenting Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretariat of Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary," resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has reported that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly operating at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is their desire to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the event attendees celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is self-defined as the "seed of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are indeed equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, instead of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to step out of the North Stream 2 "inadequate" pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, IDF, called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "think indecently" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think indecently" her candidacy for the presidency after the mid-term election.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to take up high office," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy seriously as President."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm frankly worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said, "Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the Senator shouldn't appear, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidacy of ex-Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would reveal his decision officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin for the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families who suffer ramifications from TEPT and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers bring back," he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room," and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little bit differently, they return hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence
Eighteen-state representatives and the district presented a curiae friend Friday in Washington to support an asylum application challenging politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the sons of the violent gang member" attacked her, but US officials denied her asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, declared on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require asylum applications to be made in accordance with the facts and the particular circumstances of the lawsuit, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that policies that deny the entry of immigrants harm the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide necessary jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Assile is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all problems, not even the most serious, people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her child with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their shoulder, are outside the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are treated outside because of the strong shocks that are repeated.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I heard no more.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with "advertising ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's pay supplement Wednesday at The Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of imitating itself in the US Congress elections on November 6th, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to impersonate itself in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that this is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen the oranges grow in mutual imports.
The vengeful oranges in China at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trump Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, and Iowa's ex-governor, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers, and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled harassment with the publication of propaganda announcements in our free press."
"In publicizing their propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert a pay ad into The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few discrepant voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens can have about China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans detach women's voters before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
Since many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate at the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court, which is facing various demands for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the forthcoming mid-term election.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School at Syracuse University in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
Friday morning, the Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November approaches) as they marched into the hall of the Senate while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voting women of suburban and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote while they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed his sexual assault claims to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, President of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the accused, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the scale slightly leaning towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents doubtless or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe in an unquestionably or likely Kavanaugh way.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubtless during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating applications filed by Ford and, at least, by another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez complains that the Supreme Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while studying Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the website is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "to dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is exclusive of the personal online store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates appropriate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some staff developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the cleric of the Winning Cross of GM · Global Voices
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Winning Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial tombstone in a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's proselyte custody.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery" he advanced the row before throwing himself on a single gun with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat that he could never equal, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed out of bed all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 and refuse to see the most important event.
The San José poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and had to be live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were amazed when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset about spending the night awake until morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in cartoons as "a sort of vomit joke."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is inappropriate, so they switched to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's marketing and communication vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the perch, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to resolve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channel, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and they weren't all nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
At Desert Island Discs Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to "hope" other people.
He also said that being a father had no interest in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a wreck in Laverne's first show, said that he felt "less than" to others because "he was not socially acceptable like children."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, were real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a top-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games of this year in Australia to ask more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he was fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to "hope" others.
The world tricampion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 grander than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are so young (he participated in his early 14 - year - old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the tickets in London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him," father, you wouldn't be there to occupy the first row," he said.
"As he held his hand, he stopped breathing and was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still put the hen skin on him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson introduced himself to the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event to beat a record for 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the "furballs" and "oursomes" fashions on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has usually been for the United States, the five-time winner of the main tournaments takes his time to play as an cheerleader and work on his game in the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the algid moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult route of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the deflected blows.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood rookie to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down when starting the 12 individual parties, start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role perfectly for that day, he slapped me in the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
It's a hall of fame and it's brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I was training, and that's how we thought we should move on.
He wants to be there, like any other."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overshoot Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a race to the Ryder Cup that hasn't matched their individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 empaths, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, bromist, he likes to mock people and he's a great partner for the team," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun messing with him this week, which was fun to see.
It brings a lot more to the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a little while," said Bjorn, in the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 as much Friday as yesterday, which left the scorer in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that are not over yet.
You have to go to all the machines tomorrow.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the dots go up on the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also keep in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of their players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's okay, but the individual duels test your ability to play golf to the full.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best of himself as well."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival Captain Jim Furyk, hopes that his players will yield better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points to four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about last day's ups and downs, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with a good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to circumstances and the best way to try magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the fight against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Army frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old ships of war of the Cold War era, but it will not do so, at least, until the next year it comes from faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The finalisation of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships the Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-buckets missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 strike was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Drassana in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of why he has returned, but the German media have quoted several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made him useless if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew required for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
Besides, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also beginning to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings indicating that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Army "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but no new replacement was provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Army.
The National Foundation is spying on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
Discoveries are expected to provide new data on the behaviour of these only flying mammals and help with future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Scottish Foundation will follow soprano and common bats, in addition to bats north ears and water in the Botanical Garden of Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the property's key locations to track bat activities during the station.
Volunteers and personnel from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Analysing the sound of expert records will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Conservation Advisor to the National Scottish Foundation, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has been considerably reduced in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighthouses also pose a risk, as do matamosque paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their hunting night habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to place insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with the right training, conducting surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
Even, the organization has created the first and only Scottish reserve dedicated to bats on the Threave Estate farm, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The farm administrator, David Thompson, claims to be the ideal territory for the species.
"Here in Threave, we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and quite a good habitat.
But we still don't know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us to understand better what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of checking whether there were bats before doing property maintenance tasks, since the possible involuntary destruction of a single motherhood nest killed more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish bat conservation foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while his lawyers file a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that allegations of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "want to become famous" because of his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping a US woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at the time $375,000 because the incident didn't go public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live in which he addressed his 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to become famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "inadmissible information on suspicion of private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an import corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel suite and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where, presumably, they raped her anally, according to reports filed in Clark County Courthouse, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except for a "1 percent."
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual intercourse, but they were consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because he was "fearing reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman claims that she seeks to nullify the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to play for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he has won for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret" if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "a concern" that Toyota's base in the UK told the BBC that, if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of an agreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Coming out of the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU will work has aroused the fears of other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the production chain in the case of unsolicited Brexit.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "fair-time" basis, with pieces that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers of the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union without any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark asserts that theresa May's Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We have to come to an agreement, we want to get the best deal that we can, as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long term, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union at the plant, said members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: "Experiencefully, when these jobs are lost, they never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "put up a week" as he continues the fight over the nomination to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements by the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, Russian links and helps Trump and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired the deputy attorney general and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in a rumor that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate judicial committee to which they testified Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "No dates are set yet, it might be this week, although it may delay another week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like keeping the press informed."
Some journalists could refute this statement: Sanders hasn’t had a White House briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're braggards."
He then implied that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President makes more question and answer sessions than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders said that information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility of asking the President of the United States directly, it is far more infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strange in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees of the Scottish National Health Service as a result of fears about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wants them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be on the way to the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's time for all of you to be convulsive.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers resurgence has been subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the defeat by 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to reports by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has reported to the press that the injury occurred just before half the injury occurred.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further testing.
A Tennessee State officer reported Chris Harris, WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris has added that "there's still no information on the type or scope of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of second-year Abercrombie with Tennessee State after they hit it from Illinois.
He had completed five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 of them this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of the Corbyn movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The farm expects up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
It is expected that a higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for government action to fight the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The estate expects to obtain up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure arrives weeks after Boris Johnson has applied for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people get their first home.
He accused the big constructions of keeping the prices of property high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct the "real estate disaster" of Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rent controls and termination of "no guilt" evictions.
He also wants to give the city council more power to build new homes.
May said this: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with their abroad, to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on their own is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes everything even more real."
Jack Ross: "My maximum ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, has claimed that his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots have accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, currently ranked third in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called once as a supporter and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound program.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I am successful in training at clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in the position of Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's trainer says he doesn't feel the pressure to be the next one on a list of consecrated names on such a team, after having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"So far, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just consider that I've been successful here if I can get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts' technical body.
He helped Aloa avoid third-class downsizing and transformed St Mirren's fight for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a Clyde player, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the position in the Alloa.
"I had always believed that training was what was best given to me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it right, I did it reasonably and enjoyed enough good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
I still spend it on things like stress and pressure from work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've felt since I was an adult."
You can hear the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland, between 12:00 and 13:00, UK time.
The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has triggered consumption in bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to the restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA's financial consultancy, the company that has collected the data, says: "The constant hours of sunshine and England's participation in the world, which has expanded more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars offering food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, the sales of beverages have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the entertainment analysts and the RSM hotel company, said: "These results continue the trend that we see from the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sporting events remain the main factors related to sales of the foreign market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a drop in sales of 4.8% inter-yearly would be especially damaging, rather than continuing pressure for costs.
This long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the trades serving food and time will tell if the mildest temperatures we have in August will provide such a necessary breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in the brand presentation.
The sales indicator in the UK's The Coffer Peach Tracker sector for restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages.
News has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" parenting account
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in the "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
About 20 percent of students say they have a clean "primary" account that they show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to "violate me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private Schools Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "seeds of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish federation of athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Federation directive at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more medals from Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to act as athletes' voice, and I hope I can make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote this on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's time to do agile exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
An ad comparing mothers with cows divides their opinion on the Internet
A stripper has divided their opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows who are dying.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent t-shirt that can be taken from the world," consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom that the new t-t-t-t-t-t-shirt gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of beans and cows at the pace of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I care about myself, but you won't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not panties, but my breasts."
The round goes on, "Bombeja, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, milking girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim that it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to announce the product.
Like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after they are born," one person wrote.
The Elvie t-shirt is discreetly hidden in a lactating bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter commented: “Understandingly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to announce a tirade for mothers that will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out of place ad."
Other people defended the announcement; a woman admitted that she found the song "fun fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the tyrant made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another commenter commented: “It’s a fun advertisement for mothers who pump with tyrants (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like cows.
It's not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced discreetly to the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use tyrants.
However, the Elvie t-shirt is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a lactating bra, which gives women more freedom to move, subject babies and even get out as they pump.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first childhood partner and developer, said: "The Elvie t-shirt is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a t-shirt is used and the challenges it entails, while at the same time demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new t-shirt.
It's not the first time the Elvie t-shirt is on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children, silently transferred to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained emigrants has increased even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be fathered.
Traditionally, most godfathers were paperless immigrants, who have been afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk if they decide to host a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the possible godfathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of people who have taken or live in the home of a person who has been admitted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to submit to the court within a month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear for videoconferencing, instead of witnessing, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are considered unfit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children in custody spend, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports that the system has made known in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to their size, signs indicating that a child is suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to emotionally prepare them or say good-bye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," she said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that "the war of terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced persons.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-stricken country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unreasonable" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion, Idlib, has favoured the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear ends" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, including Al-Nusra Front combatants, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a United Nations envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably wait, scandals and the process of removal end with his presidency prematurely.
Which would certainly be "the end of a most dramatic presidency in history."
At the moment, there's no sign of fatigue on the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak time has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and practically tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak time, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" fromMSNBC, has led cable TV audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have stood in the way because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor," about a cabinet decreer who becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered that because he made her laugh," said Scovell.
There's a entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine Roe v. Wade's future, if immigrant families could meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "private use" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut leather jacket ("a piece of thick clothes like his pride," held the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and scripting of Trump's program (to chat with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind it.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

Foreign money floods the races of parliamentary elections in the House of Representatives more adjusted
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the Congressional districts that has made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the square in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the 17th district.
The maps were redrawed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the party's leading financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a special, closely followed election in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but they withdraw them.
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the department, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which in 2017 received grants from the United States of $140 million, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The sanctions proposed, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths for murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on economic security and prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and saw it as a step forward to prevent emigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended up with any likelihood of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration, according to diplomats.
The three US envoys discreetly returned to their office in the Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event in progress could be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
As far as we know, Mueller also investigates whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the organization, just when he prepares to do so in front of the voters, and even before a jury of party members.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, nor any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of fluctuating history on points of inflection like this and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of inflection points today.
What happens if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein asserts that the information in the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we don't get past these tests, democracy will start to run danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovak deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with swastika.
With this luggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, an optimist in the face of the Vienna Rapids match
The Rangers receives the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive tie in the Vila-Real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to rank as the G Group of the Europa League.
One injury to the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against the Royal Village, but he believes that Rangers can use this as a stepping stone to achieve great results.
"It was a good point for us, because the Royal Village is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the party believing we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something else at the end, but in general, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first part, but we were better at the second part.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll get it all and we'll get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's good and the guys enjoy it, the training's good.
I hope we can give it all away, leave last season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of the polls at the national level say they talked to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent of respondents say they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't dare to consider it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t communicate your desires in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining cost.
It includes your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how these expenses are paid.
Your long-term financing options for your care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: Cut the passage into legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary takeover for your finances.
It is important to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that needs to be determined, but also what doctors you want to deal with," said Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed-air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man got several shots from a compressed-air shotgun as he came home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
'The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 p.m. (in the British summer schedule), as a "random act."
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not at risk for the wounds and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, according to the authorities.
Since the communications are cut, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from Donggala's regency, an area north of Palu closer to the peak of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Cèlebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches over 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Cèlebes.
The region, an administrative region less than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
The exploration of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Moroali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is at the Pacific Fire Belt and earthquakes are often occurring at a certain frequency.
Below are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, on Sumatra coast.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck south Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook a pop area of Padang city, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's reign in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population remembered the devastation of the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred in the Indonesian island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaskan ex-governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, his phone stretched.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su interim detention centre, where he is held with a $500 unsecured obligation, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A faults, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time there's been criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the veteran court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His partner declared that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a quashed earthquake on the Indonesian Island of Celebes Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are broadcast at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a New York terrorist attack suspect
New York's federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that hasn't been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway bike lane at Lower Manhattan and run-in and cyclists during his route in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to claim the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-failure indictment that included eight counts of murder for organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaević Saipov caused wounds, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to perform spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that she told the researchers that she felt good about what she had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be deployed in his hospital room.
He's pleaded guilty to the charge of 22 flaws.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to apply for the death penalty, instead of accepting a conviction and a life imprisonment without possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Member of the Parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians must "feel pressure from Eurosceptics" when one of the members of Theresa May's own parliament suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Presiding Conservative MP Peter Bone said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be out of the EU if Mr. Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives for the union have presented themselves in another protest against the Brexit in The City.
The prime minister is fighting to preserve her Chequers engagement plan between the attacks of the Brexit supporters, the union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave de Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be gone by now,' he said.
Parliamentary Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers' commitment."
To specify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed its mindset and wants to stay there is totally false."
The conservative supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, that I listen to people."
"Chequers's commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who come out and get us to win an election.
Leave Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their work when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that rally politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, union supporters marched for Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists stirred banners about the Conservatives against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives for security issues suffered by a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Agreement plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at an open meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presenting for his re-election in November against the state representative of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It's been a centre of speculation about the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
The evening Saturday event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our failing government, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for killing Sims, from the LSU.
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for death by LSU basketball player Wayde Sims Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the subway.
Sims, 20, got shot and died near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody by the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starters during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position at the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel came in boxes before and left Hamilton running with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved after a certain wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the inner part free at the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third horn.
Max Verstappen began in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in a good position in much of the race, keeping his wheels to save time, moving on to Kimi Raikkonen and moving to fourth position.
He finally went into the boxes in turn number 44, but couldn't increase his pace at the next eight laps, and Raikkonen placed himself in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true lord who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "sick, cruel, and lying."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, cruel and lying," she said.
"When you look at the comms and the leaks and they say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember his answer-- did you filter the document? "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't filter it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh of Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leaking would proceed from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak his story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the candidate at the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to hang for power and control," the President said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the victory of Friday's Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-point advantage thanks to the finishings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the three previous games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance, four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team at the game at 13:10 a minute before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16 a minute.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage at the first pause when he reached the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an aircraft from an earthquake
An air controller in Indonesia has become a hero after he died to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a massive earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area and there are many people trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure the Batik 6321 flight, which was on the track at the time, could safely take the flight.
Then he stepped out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation representative, Indonesia, Yohannes Syrait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"That's broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster relief agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's representative.
Waves, with a height of up to six metres, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minumercats have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
Indonesia experienced another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that is going to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said that 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try and find him.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane moored the pond because the runway was shortened.
Some witnesses think the plane went overboard.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that himself and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and that he suffered a slight wound to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had worked nearby to improve a dock also helped the rescue with an inflatable vessel to transport the people affected to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in an aircraft accident registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a nighttime timeline that burned a woman alive
The prosecution closed the case on Saturday in the review of a man's trial accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis camp.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that that day he was not in the city.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Phone records indicated that only a week had passed.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis suppressed text messages, phone calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to take place in the hands of the jury throughout the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills its music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol's The High Breed ensures that the hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put the conscious hip-hop back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Mainwriter asks a couple to say good-bye after a "racist" message
A nurse in New York has denounced a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a message of misdirected text from the mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racists and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first got to work in 2016.
"OurOOOOOOOOOOOOTHER NEGRLA PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After noting her pifia, a "uncompromising" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the maid who had fired, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with an Uber.
Now Maurice claims the couple compensation for the dismissal and seeks compensation of approximately 350 USD a day for work with six months' residence for which they had hired him, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he explained to the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they are racists claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
"My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, in the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to an "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion court has been hastened to denounce the couple on social media and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to get into the place of someone who reads it for the first time before their publication.
It's so funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before having the inspiration to write the children's book on a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he wasn't a presumptuous one," he said.
"But, since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's not your business.
I think he considered that to be the success of Paddington.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized his own credit for Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
When they landed, they took their daughter fast to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad frequently called to say that he was very serious and that they did not expect him to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I'm going to call Nad and she told me she'd die in the next two minutes and she had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs he had been given to him because his body kept beating themselves up and they were coming out of his system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, as I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving at the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head cut and the tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her so much."
Women of mourning hang cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to feel what I need to hear every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people to whom you can go, that they can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he was not well or depressed or anything like it," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He played deep on Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to work it out, "Open a hole in the family.
He destroys us.
But we must go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future holds up a thread while the FBI initiates an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for -- an investigation with a limited scope and time -- we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. "He also added that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed with the dead end of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, the Republicans don't get any good results, they'll see a weakness in getting the man they want to get elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "cau" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unity said that 1,127 deserts had occurred last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices of human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
Normally, the vast majority of Northern deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of Korea's war in 1953.
The majority escape across China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, instead of refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Early in the month, leaders from both countries gathered in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and is not fit to work at the High Court
The minority leader of the Nancy Pelosi House said that the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh High Court is a "histeric" and that his temperament is incapacitated to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have told her it's a "histeric," said Pelosi in relation to his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the accusations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes shouting and remaining speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and said the accusations against him were "a grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness demonstrated that he could not work at the High Court, showing his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, you're not only capable of being in the High Court, but also in the court where you are now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge at the District Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions as to whether he would overrule certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and expect us to look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and you can't get it out without crying.
"Weep when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's common.
She went on... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I kept going.
It seemed brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories that I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I ended up weeping with an indescribable rage, is that of a older woman (a cold directive that had always terrified me a little) who took me from the back and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought that there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blanc and the seven dwarfs."
Because he was late in the campaign, he was behind the fundraiser, so he promised he wouldn't get to the race if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to men were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and to focus on voters, rather than on delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he ran out of words.
"You might have thought you had a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder reminded you of the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put in my grave?
"Was he crying?"
How U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing · Global Voices
The initial saves of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although it does not seem that the war will soon end, a distance between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant scale occurred this week, with new oranges affecting products worth $200,000 million, and these oranges impose taxes on half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has counterattacked every time in the same way and has recently raised oranges from five to ten percent for 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the US and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will come to a close.
Making Washington go back means giving in to some demands, but publicly leaning in front of the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US could benefit China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional help or help from countries that funded insurgency.
Europe's Selection Gets Ryder Cup Win in Paris · Global Voices
The selection of Europe has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the North American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the blow into the water in the hole par 3 16 which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined on all of his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was set aside with a 5&4 for the less qualified player of the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection from Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of race.
"I'm not going to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
The relief goes to his countryman John Ram, who defeated the legend of North American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a race record at the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A rare statistic for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. selection fought all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed for European selection.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
It's about getting your hat off.
They have defeated us."
