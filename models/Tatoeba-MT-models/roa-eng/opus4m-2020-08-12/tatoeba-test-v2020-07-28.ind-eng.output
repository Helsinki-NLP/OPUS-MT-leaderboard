I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too tight until it can't be used to cut meat, I finally use my pocket knife.
He's blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a loser.
Where have you been?
The traffic lights are used to set the traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room gets a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have breached that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm getting used to not getting caught.
It smells so bad.

My brother likes music.
It's very easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes!
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.

You'll never be able to find your way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
The birthday card will be here soon.
Please read one more time.
When can you do that?
I was just kidding.
Tom was almost hit.
I'm going too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logo, do you?

Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy you this bag.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever gone to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary declined the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandchildren.
The boy fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He's focused on those riddles.
That man died a few hours ago.
Would you like to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We found out that the front door was locked.

I really don't understand you.
He's afraid to fly by plane.
I knew he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.

The selection of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have a choice.
I'm not sure what else I should do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked all this way, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of our laws all are equal, but the rich sometimes have more benefits.
He's gonna make it.
I like cats.
The meeting's over at nine o'clock.
Tom was mentally disturbed.

We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mom's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.

Tom married a woman easier than he was.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.

Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students go to college.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom lowered his voice so no one could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
She greets him every morning, when he enters the school building.

It was very steep, better to the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I'm tired.

The data is often inaccurate.
Wake up!

We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom required Mary to follow him.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.

We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those people are crazy!
