What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected in the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new colleagues at the ODS.
The newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" to the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they knew the argot that was born in the last few years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The word coded that Prague's political cream started in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new electors did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a young man in pragois politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, elected to culture in the test of the word of the "sponsor".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of golf.
"It's the only expression among those you propose that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the clay.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year prior to the ODS' pre-éctoral congress, the editor chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry, "nerf de ox", "treason of the capital" and "entolor".
Three of the elect agreed for the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek rejected the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not appear to recognize in the above legend, that it is the influence of Janusek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he came up with in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says and immediately adds, "but I know about newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Imagingy, elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Imagey knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the pastry".
"It's, I think, going into a business," Imaginary is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janusek's companies.
About your same Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge from the newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no lexicon of argotics in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it seems that we really don't have something like that."
"The names are said to be sometimes abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the socio-democratic party, who the members of the party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," said Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The current.cz daily tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Pache, who drew attention to him before the election by the scams during the party's sponsorship, is called "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow social democrats to use inside the party.
It seems Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this pragmatic president.
"Doctor en droit de matraque" he recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctoral degree in law JUDr. at the police academy in bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "worses", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared nuns have common characteristics.
They are part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sister" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"You don't judge healthy young women either because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual social measure.
He has published a brochure that should help to limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onions has ignited the woman's contact.
The oil burned, it seemed, when the team wanted to "seek out the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sisters" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human mind eaters have always posed a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia did not even see the President himself participating last year.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a broad hunt for witches who, he said, would have participated in his death and would have been forced by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Nearly Guinean shamans came to the rescue, led to the presidential farm in Kamali, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, men and women randomly chosen in villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, people in prison had to drink a potion of plants based on the hallucinogenic effects that further caused effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bacal's tenant: The leathers are hot, he has signed a higher rent.
An elderly imposing man came out of the door of the customer centre of the RPG Byty company of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter's and his son's who is trained to purge a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for an apartment 2+1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," points out from the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," explains t he moved in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a leaflet will be published to explain the method to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door there is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number is already starting to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but new rents do not seem to affect people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems such as everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio receive mails with new leases in their letterbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still being tested," she answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and from the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Social Democrats reported on this in a fairly sustained manner prior to the elections and now fills in local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a pot...n of iron in the toilets, it relieved in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mainly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign as RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a return of half of the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who have signed their new contract by December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the window.
And yet RPG puts on its website as well as in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'It is not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"This is nobody going to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the client centre gives him a reason.
"I have 13,000 pension crowns and I have 5000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic in early 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG Byty company, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase of the rent.
However, in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years 2011 to 2014 this is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the padded chairs of the waiting room on Havirovka Street, however repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments, or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
"And it will always be up to 7.50 Czech krona per month," the screen says.
The increase of 38 percent concerns only 400 apartments in the GDP portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount 19.66 Czech krona at m2," RPG adds.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase of rent have priority.
The mother's school is also part of offices that included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he would also have a mini kindergarten with everything he needed - walls of colors, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
Arch. Design's architectural project company, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially children's age, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to get back to work quickly.
At the same time as shorter working contracts, the mother's school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is financed by means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (with 2.8 million Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure qualified staff and start-up.
After the use of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. has an obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the request for staffing.
Care for children is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a nurse throughout the day take care of children. Children can go to kindergarten without limitation of age, but they are more than three years old for most.
As it is a "ministerial school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day more are replaced.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the mini-maternal school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children only play there but quality education is also guaranteed there - from beginning to preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys and imaginative games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not feel the stress of delay in looking for children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a spine of dinosaur and the balconies to the mouths of open fish.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received the nickname House in bones from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, here's all that's ypic for Art New of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, its colours and pleasant textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the blades.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in Passeig de Gracia market street at the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first stressed the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and better-selling reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for an apartment for the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators also worked for the facade.
The joint work on the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after its completion due to its organic forms "the House in Bones".
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with aeration events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely failed to comply with the then construction directives and was not hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and requested modifications.
He did not, for example, like the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction stumble on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two top floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third room there was a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is divided by a staircase through which you can reach up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the wells of light.
The two-coloured game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark which instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a profitable business and expanded the scope of visits to common spaces and to the barn, including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket in the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the bed area, so the mattress and the sumier provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the selection several things are decisive: weight, size, age, state of health as well as the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the sumier is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where the latex mattresses are not continuously asleep are not appropriate because they "heat" slowly.
They also have higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. The mould can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who passes the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hockey players who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a tumbling layer of lazy foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus mistakes "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the stuffed furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL in order to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you will not return in the night as after a difficult game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
To choose the mattress depending on your size, add the length of your feet, approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or in all 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des Borreliers-Mathelassiers and decorators who have been dedicated for several years to the problem of sound sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own mattress and mattresses, so be careful while choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the top at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"To touch or in position seated on the mattress you must not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of sleeper.
The sleeping bed, when the mattress and the sumier are united like the somois sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we mustn't wash it, which is often done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and blocked) sputum.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make claims over a 25-year life span for a mattress or life assurance.
But everything to his mind.
And for this a advice of experience from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for coating the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with slide closure for the whole, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a dreamer?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there is no aeration holes) and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Taschenfederken Germany) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of such a bed.
For single-position lamella tops with 14/18 blades, the latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the rigidity adjustment of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special link of the blades that allows pressure or even tilt the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back," it's really important.
This is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses that for the "male" have begun to use a softening area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at hip level again.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet tops with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and dilutes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and puffed with air) on good mattresses and sleeper, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its stitches must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the shoulder cradle of the upper or the area rammolizes in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybean.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr Vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender perfumes.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of bulwark plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs the heat and cools the body, "refried" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
Current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a cell structure disrupted thus more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for mattress and top is not simple.
From time to time we can have two mattresses for the price of only one in special shares by manufacturers or producers.
For example, Magniflex company that offers Duofreez mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second one for free.
The age of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts suffered from the start of huge load factors.
The tempur softens to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is for this ideal against sleep sickness and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up in the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as for example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a light box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracing devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is not aware of it, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," Pilin adds.
He said children should always know what "box" is used for and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
'Even smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something deliberately when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led the parents to long expectations," Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a prepared rapture, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
It also admits that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to RC Monitoring company Robert Cech, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on a regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains nevertheless."
'The most expensive devices also have a tiltometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in a lying position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having formed it with a special prological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to those used in pendants of the size of a light box or to smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are being carried out to make devices similar to common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll figure it out after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed as a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to plot cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could tour the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Since last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km of it.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the strings is up to two to four years.
The army bought detonating cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the auction of a huge amount of DNES MF detonating cords that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be made by army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise annually.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the military's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
That distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the military reserves could survive for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, means that the army with its new purchase has assured - also the consumption of special units and engineering - of reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the troops of the rapid response brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about lack of body linen.
"And I don't get my head if they buy us such a lot of detonating strings."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as content traders," says STV Group Manager Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of km of detonating cords are being seized by the army having these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life of detonating cords and pyrotechnics of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in the light of the military's criticism.
The period of life past, each ammunition must be tested to see whether it remains integrity and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said the spokesman Pejsek who made himself the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police still control only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading to the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonating cords that it buys today " inexpensive".
So far I have benefited from contacts I have received through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun likes to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me the desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
It reinvests the benefit in the building that it transforms into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has enabled him to open up to Liberiac 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year another of the same quality happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrava U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels," the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs showed up.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the contractor of the year served well," adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in and around Liberia.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses until today his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition I began to maintain business relations on a regular basis.
According to him, success-related reputation has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet at the worst moments behind himself.
The one who came looking for the price at Slovansky dum for the first place of the firm competition last year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tool shop at Ceska Skalice into a 100 million Crown turnover firm.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my employees as well and has increased our self-confidence to fight against competition,' said today the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after confiscation of property by communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few comrades around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they started specializing in the vegetable oil press.
He became after eighteen years the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company was even known in the unspecialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers begin to really get to know the Farmet brand but also foreign partners who began to realize that they were collaborating with a company that had the greatest success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not pass to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have not, of course, escaped this situation."
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fire," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the staff, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibition fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of claims are also up to and with them the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes foolish regulations.
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time part part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The little glory of this year's survey of the Absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring the documents that officials can obtain online to offices.
More than one third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can obtain it in two clicks of a mouse.
It changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this year's Absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters showed up, it was at least 4000 this year that gave their vote.
And it's not surprising, there are the most diverse legal obligations in our country that only hinder the company, and that is increasing.
"We may be the number of documents to be completed for tax returns in the world's top places," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic stands at 74th place in terms of the conditions for the company, i.e. 8 more places than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first set up in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone may report on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April each year at the end of September, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the greatest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, it was about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees there is, for example, the obligation that highway and highway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November at the Place Wenceslas in Prague, is part of a happening in which people regularly participate in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts heels in the entrepreneurs' legs and for this my aim is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company', said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a stroke of sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days earlier to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most common obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was deleted with the Act on what is called the Green Card.
And everything's okay until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 Absurdity was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by the Ministry of Health's order last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are assessed.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for five years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Firm.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the firm's 2010 competition organized by the firm Vodaphone, companies that did not succeed with a single long-term objective for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their business is different from one another, their support and forecast activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one thing, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Czech Republic are the Pragosoian Prological Society and Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In caring for employees with health problems, we can also mention the old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 percent of them and which, for this reason, has obtained the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and which has placed third place in the region in the Competition of the Farm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreased to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, lowering wages.
The jury also awarded him the title because it prioritizes Czech manufacturers, supports dityenous activity in the vicinity and concerns about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also considers the health of its employees and has set up a chair and an ergonomic keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation Man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the latest, also for its activities, there is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the brown company Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible Society category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, which had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and had sent it to the organizer before August 15.
The incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the "principal" contest the Vodaphone Year Firm."
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
Detectives passed handcuffs to the local contractor and traded in Lubos real estate. G.
He had endeavoured to handle a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed field was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for initiation in the context of a public tender and competition," said the newspaper Pravo the head of the Plzen Prosecutor's Office Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
After 24 hours the police released this 46-year-old contractor.
In order to determine how it could influence a public competition, it can only be speculated in the light of so little official information.
In a question of Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The public contest according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is put in place when several eligible candidates are registered.
"These persons propose, within the framework of the appeal, a higher value of their right to restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of buyers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Lubos G. clearly had the information concerning the persons who had registered in the appeal and, as he himself was, also, a beneficiary since having purchased a large number of refund entitlements, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he probably got it from retreating.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts far above standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the construction decision had already been issued.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the access artery to the Borske Pole industrial area was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The city hall was forced to accept because otherwise it would risk putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to pull out of their wallets up to a hundred crowns per month more than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be close to 100 crowns per year for households in apartment more than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
While electricity and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, families in Liberia will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragmatists will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4%.
The rent prices will increase, for example, significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments starting in January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regular rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and acts softly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet 15 years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism do not make the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions of hospital children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be salty."
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of Children's Department of Horvice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to suck a bottle to Dad in the closet, it's sometimes about whiskey but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," explains the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's modern alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Chief of the Pelikan Department, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 attending hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horvice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from around completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
"She started her career at twelve years of age when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol into the blood with an additional mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the neglect of parents or their unusual tolerance in view of the fact that their rejections of drinking are the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"The term alcohol means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena resulting from it but not found in children."
"In those who use repeat acool, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said the Chief of the Pelikan Department.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, approximately 40 Jewish children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with an intoxication strike requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
The drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he excites according to Pelikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
" Either they drink by themselves after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course I lived on witch day an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the following day from the "wood mouth".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are for this better fighting because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised from where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education, counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to pay back one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression managements, which should recover from parents the expenses related to care, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday to Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercise or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
For the moment they are staying at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Press Department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were taken on long-storied aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He argued that the army would not be left out because in May 2009 the department signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 single-places unused into two two-seater seats.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who considers how to accomplish this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was held last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and directly contacted EADS.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has purchased 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only 24 aircraft that want to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because aircraft should have been selected in a European tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annullary is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by British Cancer magazine.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years of age," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
This could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health records, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as well as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longest index than the annual risk, however, fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years of age the risk decrease reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less than testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is precisely what helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former President of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech Republic as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, most of the time of compact snow, the breakers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd km towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague underwent the same fate.
The Dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st kilometer a truck was injured, at 93nd two heavy weights were hit, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on Highway D1 to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter 182 km to Kyvalka.
A line of cars several kilometres has formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident, and this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car rows are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramways are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Place de la Paz (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the state of the Prague crisis still needs to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
Czech Railways have already had to be removed due to snow 7 fast connections.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravie are already rolling but doubling vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road to Brno it begins to be there by places of snow gusts and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain channels of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratic-Milesovice
To clean them, we may need to send snowblows and strawberries.
We can't currently estimate when they're rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is rigorous in the White Carpathians region.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow alert CTK.
In Chechnya, it fell between two to ten centimeters of snow; it fell the most in North Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravie-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Snow was gradually disappearing in Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army sent in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as code XM-25.
Generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly broken explosive actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it explodes at the target's contact but also at any point in their ballistic path.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon using "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon charges and pulls at 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu group relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is currently located in the office building of the Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its Bad Homburg branch in Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specializing in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working methods of employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He claims that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region generated yesterday the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The economic affairs officer of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu fits the city and its deployment constitutes an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our assistance to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the building of the Marinenbader Square.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu company and the neighbouring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project from the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall. This one raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive surface design that used to be used in part as a parking space, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the notation company and investment advice company, Ferri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens, moved to buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt Specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group located in Tokyo is considered to be the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square metres have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider expelled the website specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This may hide political pressure following the publication of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever more force.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, probably lives in Great Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Free expression in the country of freedom," e-activists from the revelations on the social network Twitter said on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN's television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee on Territory Protection threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon would take this measure earlier in view of Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, and thus puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world," according to an independent honourable senators' statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristin Hrafnsson told London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the advisor to Chief of Government Mr. Stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the U.S. President, Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the means by which all administrations exchange and protect information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
So where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the hole and then starts selling it.
To find out, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbiter manufacturer founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that ice cream out of its machines would respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Also, practical sessions are held in the private ice store.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries across all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a ferocious member of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer in the future a quality European product in the country of the Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a company management consultant and she wants, after a few years, to draw a few unique things from this challenging job for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good flavor, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a lot of romanticism."
The first stage in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees through an electronic program and then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a faucet installed on the machine: it comes out a pasteurized base white cream, based on all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is soon asked: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free courses to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, of guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only it has to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will crunch nothing but ice granules.
Certain changes to the basic mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano draws the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to trace dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and, when added to the cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily include the taste of the walnut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if fishing purée is used with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (vingarons use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is simultaneously beaten available to make it expensive and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight panics are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barboured of fruit from the head to the feet and thus crushes his fellow students when control of the colossal bowl mixer escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the view that such an "accident is likely to occur at each course: it's only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimentes with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated decisively in the development of the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticism expressed by Mr.Then.
The requirements set out in paragraph 2 are in line with the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the industry's trade mark which would ultimately be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union in charge of control and the industrial lobby, which has raised suspicions both of the German Federal Environment Agency and of MEPs.
However, Ephsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he was working for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization considers itself a neutral forum for experts who, among other things, belong to the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Thenn disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize causes the field," said Mr.Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which do not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, then how can we discover them?" asked Mr.Then on an accusing tone.
This is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "industry controls security research".
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell has taken care of this, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her back tube.
There was a manifesto.
He was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators came and began to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people have protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement that was badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He's got a few pieces of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still does not know what he will do with this fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old munitions deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reports that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of project S21.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the parallelpiped stone weighs on average 80 kilos of which the value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to make it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 complete loads of a truck.
About half of them are still trapped in the forest, with the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Specials.
They came from all over and took everything that could get into the safe and the trailers.
These scandalous stones of Stuttgart have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass-band dishes.
"This stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"wasn't this political component."
He gets into his car all over the ground, turns around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did legal studies he abandoned, and later he began studying biology before taking an interest in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
The stock is 40000 tons.
He loves treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims he is the biggest merchant of ancient stones.
He's referring to himself.
Sculpted sandstones with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, affirms with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
He showed a pile of the finger: Red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Good travertine."
The parallelpiped was once part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion rostrum.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefectures, the red granite from the St Blasien cathedral, the tuft from the Heilbronn hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand carved and moved with simple patterns and carts drawn by cattle, he became quite respectful.
"This would be a scandal if such an heritage were to be part of."
He didn't get rich, even less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone thongs, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Struggling talent to conquer high potentials
The counter knows a great deal of inflow.
16 students flock to buy small bread from salmon, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a competition of ideas, they need to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, passing on, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to identify better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they reach the employment market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify the outstanding talents in practical projects and to support them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig, the automotive group amadoues the talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
It discusses the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; it shows them the ways to access the group's premises.
It is Nico Selle from the technical university of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can meet the students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was rather on the professional project," said Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much stronger.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by doing a triad on a roster of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all shorten the highly skilled workforce.
These are mainly graduates from engineering lines who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecast, the gap in engineering positions will increase further.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes costly talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel this way to the United States.
Participants can access KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in touch with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their demands to our company soon," he said.
Apart from the direct adoration carried out on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a completely classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in the professional trade fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
At present, 35 positions are put in competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or to write his or her final study project at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized ambiance, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group often cannot do this," said Stübe, chief of staff.
There has been a long time when money has no longer played the primary role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute constitutes an annual picture of German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at employees' framework conditions.
The head of staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this investment will enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
"I think the candidates refer mainly to external evaluations in respect of a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When employees are treated well and identify themselves with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on the new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the state of the south-east of the United States, over the years to come.
The Washington Government has issued a ban on the equivalent of a ban and has therefore permanently cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
The secretary to Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It was the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that caused this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this life-threatening accident at eleven employees and leading to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to allow for further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama is expected to present its conclusions on December.
In October, the secretary of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after many allegations of corruption, is currently being reformed in depth.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the profitable fiscal niches of gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the food flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The government's objective is to put a stop to rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" according to the outcome of a current BDO audit firm survey conducted in the sector prior to the drilling ban issued on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulations."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is brown oil; it smells like that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't wear yourself out," the ecologist's activist to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man immersed in the muddy water up to the chest, as well as the fat sledge that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the colour of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil mats.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom relates that once she collected shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil fell off an oil pipeline that exploded in the immense tide.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to go for six hours to reach fish waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the ravages leaps into the eyes when the mangrove marshes are crossed by watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat breaks a brown crading water. Anyone who dives his hand removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground as a stretcher. The isolated palm trees are sadly holding their palms.
Bird clouds are sought in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the off-board engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise once it looks like a service station by the smell it smells.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," said Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield that has been besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is prohibited from this society: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred metres stand in the water of steel tiles as strange sculptures: "Christmas trees" are very affectionately designated as the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rusted by corrosion up to the marker.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have flown into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that which has flown into the sea during the accident of the super-petroleum "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution?The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner challenged Shell's group to apply essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of the pipelines is still much higher than elsewhere.
Some forms emerge from mangroves to a place that, from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of camouflages and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camboules up to the neck.
A sparklight under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a pattern on the site must be detected: a small underground refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline penetrates a container through pipes, then at the end of the conduction of kerosene drops fall and we finally get diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-liter Diesel barrels every day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents benefited from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: For they buy their raw materials free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" that put the pipeline network in perce across the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The networks of organized crime, which also include members of the politicians and high-ranking military, bear the lion's share in tanks and the bradent on the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether the environmental disaster should be attributed or rather subversive activities to the population or the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishers' lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the relations of the Ogoni especially with regard to Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal of the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time you've been out of line" announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can show up at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them wine pots.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to enjoy as all Nigerians enjoy the raw material.
"In all respects, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible lack of construction that could lead to "catatrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
As of early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had had so far been more likely: In the course of its investigation, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and warned against a potential lack of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cramps and leaks at the level of the oil pipeline connection, is indicated in a position published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
Reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft in the A380 series are concerned.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4th in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which allows her to take further legal action against society.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts have been detached and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is the source of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that further safety tests will be carried out on super-jumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said Astb's spokesman, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized on the ground its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precaution measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the largest line plane in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered with white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grate: By glacial temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow in Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per location.
Traffic is highly restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they could not come to an end from the snow that was growing.
In addition, violent gusts have swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the tides will take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow masks on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the Meteomedia bad weather alert has announced the level of violet alert has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 inches of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities announced serious road disturbances.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused a interruption in traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls affected motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious railway traffic disturbances took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, chains or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled to Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available there.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
At night in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car tossed on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will whirl in the event of slight gusts.
But the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank just embellished the group's seat: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
Now, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoting a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, "We're checking whether it's more interesting to take care of or sell buildings ourselves, and put them back into rent later on."
This is how Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of Euro272 million from its own funds holders and had then rehabilitated them.
Energy optimization transformations have, according to some indications, totalled around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the journal, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether buildings will be resold to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the deaths of minors.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for underage children who had been declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to climb up the bodies because the secure situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief team was able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be traced back.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party to commemorate the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a shining sun at Greymouth in the south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 undercover minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags have been set up in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the celebration that New Zealand had nurtured the hope that minors would return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits stated that he cannot resign to accept the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of the South of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are displaced, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splitter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre thanks to his film "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
To which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think well by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken captive; he frees himself from his burrow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents from each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is in a bad mood, he takes out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bore does not say any words about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at the very least, from the back of one or two sentences some fearful cries of agony.
Otherwise, there is nothing said and there is a feast in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decor of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the trafficking in light drugs and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant knowledge or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema of art and trial.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and in the intestines.
The lovers of action films die of boredom, when the burgundy embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut down.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no movie distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that deserve some attention, but also because the image of a striking film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor consistent action, everything is ambition, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn just gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a grim soundtrack, but above all with an irresistible hatred that slips from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who faithfully stands next to the barn, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the petty hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by becoming a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, nothing but those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at frustration, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrament work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less to submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, at least four F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in IAEA documents, as it is concerned with the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone pipepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the interior of the building.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information than at the time, and even, in time, the mystery is becoming more and more thick.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weapon program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plusible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Questioned about how he ensures that he is involved with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations provided only a laconic response in the summer stating that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly took away the debris from the "unutilized military building" with haste and made a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received images of commercial service providers' satellites from a Member State showing the time that followed the attack directly. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish its authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and has not built a reactor.
Damascus submits that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis by calling it impassable.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the el-Kibar site and refuse access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is why the investigation of this case has been pending in length since June 2008 without a result being achieved and that it is "increasingly becoming a major credibility issue of the Agency", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are here, what their function is or what they are suspected of holding.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are also known within the IAEA under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, respectively.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would very likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located on a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the IAEA inspectors from all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians are concerned that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by US secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelpiped in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one facility could be "serviced to fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are also plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would later be separated.
It is unknown whether the gravels, which could hide valuable traces, were stored in all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage of the gravels.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In recent analysis of photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria has undertaken terrassing work in all three suspicious sites and moved from huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
This may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to separate suspicions.
He said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out, which should allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus has also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not mentioned the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, states Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been discussing what has been known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls for a few months.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation climb.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who says: "It would be useful if at the end they found nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything else about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian donkey during the Yugoslavia war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, certain shooting sequences planned for Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie herself is the good-will ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago, she proposed that these women meet in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says enough about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the status of good will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted after a few hesitations an authorization to film in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and to give the opportunity to all parties taking the opportunity to express herself.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
What still makes a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his burrow".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on it, as Jolie put it, is "unfair and based on incorrect information".
Now, only Hollywood's fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything is fine again with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overrules visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry out for joy on the bottom of a strong music, they pick up feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and succeed in dropping table tennis bullets at a distance of three meters in beer chips from the opposing team.
This strange show is called "beer-pong". The winner takes 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to the beer-pong world championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the computerist reserved, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel strange," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she has earned her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes its place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people, who have only experienced moments of happiness so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten persons under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes a lot of letters from readers written by young emigrants who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunities, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave extinguishes the light."
The Law Student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government only throws it out of the eye and offers no prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crumbled from one practical internship not paid to another.
She says that it's her biggest concern to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the career hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to repay the credit contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live practically no longer."
It bursts out of a embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed at 100 percent by credit.
"These were moments of madness, no doubt money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, refreshments from hot tea and says: "I don't have children to maintain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the complaints he has often heard in recent times.
"No one must suffer from hunger, our situation is not yet as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
"Working abroad for a moment is not what can happen worse, perhaps that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughed and then talked about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, quite simply."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his palm tree, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life must not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns him well in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell night.
"Only, not much emotion," he says by drinking a long beer throat.
"Adieu, it seems still worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, relaxed, gathering some friends, with a few drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, democracy support has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp fall in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy in their country worked in practice; it was the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support for democracy.
If this has been successful during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only slightly increased in 2009 and again decreased to 32 per cent this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victims of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure has fallen compared to 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are from this opinion (and 80% support the private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest driver in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the country most influential by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the disasterd country and plunge into fear.
There were ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballot papers scattered in the guilds, polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations would be late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, would wander in the vicinity to find a place to vote.
Some of them have finally given up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged supporters, denounced fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapist, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support in voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tura reached the second round.
With an epidemic of cholera that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake who still live in tents, one feared that participation would be.
In this instance, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from voting because of the disorganization.
Almost 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, received a wave of sympathy from the public, which improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; it is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, obviously in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend extra income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition was divided, and the situation was overshadowed by Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and where others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the Statistical Office, the INDEC, which has forged official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for discussions between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the momentum to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondors who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be editing towardss an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it exists some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always stressed that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; this looks like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very prone.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will have flown.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject many of her husband's policies without noise.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of her older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors presented themselves on November 27, 70% of eligible persons, to elect municipal mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My test was successful, but it's fair.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has focused on Taiwan's complete independence, won almost 50% of all KMT votes of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr Ma would have been in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including tapping trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum outfits.
A mandatory attempted mysterious murder has also been perpetrated.
Sean Link, son of Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, held an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Link, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
However, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how absent the question of the continental part itself was.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid disrupting its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from attracting the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, called for confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to draw Taiwan back to the dock.
China has wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a challenger for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was praised as a candidate for the DPP for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" compared to Mr. Ma's haste approach to China.
Mr Chen seems overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on Taiwan being a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic one, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite a dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT says his office and his local antennas will be remodeled.
The successful results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation should be limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to become aware of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer by President Obama to take place at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a big nomination in the category of the "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding compared to the brilliant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on a chill revigorating a recording that was one of the prime favourites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positoothly" by clavierist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest to HBO's "Treme" was honored in the contemporary jazz category; he also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Arge, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved awards in the big group; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
Classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Chief of the nominations, let's say Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
Classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
One category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Bruckner Symphonies n°3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the Verdi Requiem of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho du Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin du l'Orchestre et le Cheur du Théâtre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "God Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatato Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 took its first place at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was named for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he soon wrote the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the Avi Avi Avital Mandolin, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the orchestra benefit category for leading the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only so-called vocalist-sololists; here are: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, the soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his recording " Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins the approval of the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temacula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took up this project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic bottlenecks.
But the Commissioners decided Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice takes him away."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at almost equally distributed speaking time, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted more space and better than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the findings, generated speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrology Institute, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic may occur naturally either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but never showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers suggested that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibit dogs on four flights from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced it on Thursday.
The four exposure dogs - two akitas and two pembroke Welsh corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, told Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are doing well," Whitmore says.
"They are in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
Sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month female - were healthy and except, announced by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were brought missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other scheduled events in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and keep their truck outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a terrier Parson Russell and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They've opened the windows a little, so the dogs can look fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redo again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially leased Thursday the "prepackaged" plan by creditors that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no more legal obstacles remain before MGM to fly back under the supervision of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become directors-general of what will be a relieved studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the beginning.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a credit facility of $500 million, planned to finance new GM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was initiated to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and meet the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, auction sales attracted few bidders, including none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to do everything again when the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive premiums of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $35,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success" premium of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget balanced
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed perhaps by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button stack toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of an Indian pig who sing a note when pressing them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start to support, you can no longer stop.
To combine the dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animation doll plays role-shifting games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have signed the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a back bag filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a car walk into a session with self-correction and valve classifier.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer electronic games and books and is equipped with an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a lightbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impamptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy online code, your child receives enough credit from Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Lightweightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last button cell micro-robots.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's mouth.
Bring a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin arpent a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, voiced orders with a military authority.
He wanted female members of Chengguan - responsible for law enforcement in China, afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penance for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Be straight!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, dressed in vests and identical olive-coloured pants, were looking after you.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four neatly trimmed hats at the hair top attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang, with detachment.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the green gray of the uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the lowering eyes with a strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had circled an uncontrollable snack cart by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the carrier packed his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to perform a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, their baldness and their young age.
The idea is to give the degross police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties in attracting attention to this underground urban brigade of China
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media describe the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the Province of Hubei beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them in the process of spreading a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry collector was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the assault of street vendors.
"Chenguan marked the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after a controversial debate on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district announcement required women candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in good order."
They must be over the average size of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that work was physically too difficult for women over the age of 25.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; this is about size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "interior qualities."
Chenguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of the facial features.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabled persons should not apply.
"We can't let a person who drinks or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 and has cheeks pommelled with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a rough look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to their limited mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as much as possible small bread or tofu bags before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu when a salesman walked away, temporarily abandoning his wheel-cart with noodles.
Officers describe their functions rather as monotonous than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the seller's property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after the spread of false rumors that the Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calmness is not guaranteed.
Just two pasta of plasid houses in Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by their regulations.
The owner of the bike was screaming at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, on their left face, pulled a elbow path towards their vehicle and departed at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - 40 years of age or older - are purely supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"At times, we fight physically," says Mr. Li with a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign with charges.
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case did not make the big national titles last year and damage his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, resulting from a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charge against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained on this matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many lawyers of ethics outside the Ministry of Justice, who said there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have intended to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called prohibition of the rotating lobbying door.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be suspicious of political prosecutions after a number of high-level cashbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assumes the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Counsel of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and followed up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a press release Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made at the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martled" the Ministry of the Interior on a dispute issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegian Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after having engaged Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as leader at the fourth Republican position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were sneaking away in the ranks of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case and children attached to their bed in a house that had been burned down.
On Thursday, the largely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence with the court that sketches arguments of appeal, which may occupy the courts for years.
What is provoking is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - have created a "circle atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could prompt appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the courtrooms violates human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, stating that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgement, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was an "emphasis of carnival at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue stated that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the courtrooms could allow for more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who may be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been criticized before the prosecutors, and that he abused the pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governorship and the United States Senate.
They maintained that computer media continued to attract the flames of the excitement of the case.
"The daily compass of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the court palace," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the more slow reports were a ludistic view that would undermine the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers stated that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insisted on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "representative of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring the cleavage closer?
After a campaign marked by investment and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a leading sign of genuine bipartite cooperation towards the forward or illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the Congress's leaders did not produce any breakthroughs on the big issues to be dealt with during the session of the " boisterous duck".
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion on the differences between the two parties and on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points. Empty score point partisan.
The public meeting of the Committee on the President's deficit on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; however, it still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and testing for each other in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
This is why Tuesday's meeting and participants' subsequent comments revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
The two parties, whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, remain at thousands of distances.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed over tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now alongside the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections spark partisan passions and then startled.
That's good."
On certain issues, in particular those on the agenda of the "Boyous Canard" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, only because the Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "Boyous Canard", with the ratification of the "New START" Pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "duck blade" session will not necessarily lead to better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first responses to the deficit committee's recommendations that include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reducing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
The co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the committee, consisting of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there are at least today few reasons or will to compromise on tax issues.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budgets, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be found in loss will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more serious election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common ground on issues that still divide them.
U.S. released documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and brings to the Kremlin some of the wine pots and the money of protection it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its part while the money goes up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expired.
She was drafted while Jouri Loujkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and she is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have been few cleaning traces since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he declared the following to a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy account; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City government and crime led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to affirm that the government worked more as a kleptocratic than a government", according to the embassy's note.
"The criminal elements have a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/the mafia which literally means "top" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City government.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising money from larger companies and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed on one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy's note conveys reports of men carrying bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was classified as 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy's note, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed by Larry King by CNN, Putin submitted the hypothesis that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacture and reacted with anger to the words that US diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and approaching Robin's Medvedev.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Ancient Fighters of the Red Khmer forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with bad-quality concrete walls, the principal of Anlong Veng's high school referred to the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, aged 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge visited the government, long-standing loyalty was finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, issued its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this changing situation, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng; making reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the red Khmer was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government of Pol Pot-Uni in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a follow-up in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Red fighters began to defeat the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the former Khmer Red fighters have obscured the black poverty common in rural areas of Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some Khmer Red elite officers have retained their positions as local leader in exchange for having laid down their weapons, these are low-grade and record-qualified farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are embroiled in the utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a context where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the red Khmer was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs."
The current Khmer Court has also caused concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should initiate the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate was to judge the senior officials and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but did not state whether he continued beyond these four cases.
More needs to be done to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, former district leader in the province of Banteay Menchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who failed the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as an supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, youth in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a black silk rectangle, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile phone vendor on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials stated in Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the material of about 500 pounds, according to an official who mentioned the condition of the anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to offer an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton described the "very significant, significant step-by-step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide in the coming four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and weak enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and removed, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with weakly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"Beautiful coordination and organization have been implemented with a view to strengthening confidence," said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Reduction of the World Threat.
According to the estimates of the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of uranium of military quality, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram by the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in some dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has surprised the Government of Zapatero off-the-spot" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken out of the way," says Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than about the declassified information of the Ministry of Defence of the CNI.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a luncheon between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his employees "to avoid the comments of a burning rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that passed to the confessions complained in the network of the "accuracy" of being a mother
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "T error to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two from Noia, the village of the Coruña of which she originated.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, that ABC built with the help of the testimony of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with industrial Ivan Tuñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Not long after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby belonged to him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she cohabited for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the young girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and ugly because I came to work there."
"When I had told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complained: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she says.
In May, she spoke of the return to her village: "This week I leave, but I will stay there until 19 because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job not to lose him."
She explains that if everything was going well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with someone else if that person is not my mother," doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she tapped him, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he's not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) a few hours in the summer and like that I save a little money from the babysitter."
The 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss on the part of Caesar, who asks me when are you coming?"
"Alberto says he sent you some videos, you see, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm getting ahead of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Liberator of the Prison."
"T error to the Galician (epigrapher)."
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, expresses his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell her that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday from the Minorque Judicial Prison Centre.
Office attorney Carlos Maceda explained that she doesn't remember how the facts had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either."
Before she had admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the People's Party would earn 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these comedies normally doubles the number it receives in Catalan.
For example, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomous, they obtained 316.222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than or less than 9 MPs (there are 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he now has three - while ICV would retain or win a Member.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next appointment would take place in May 2011 for municipal comedies, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that the PSC could lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would also not obtain the majority of the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fantastic that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of locations.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detainees by officials of the General Intelligence Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has attached great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that with "operation Kampai" it has "summer weakness" the Al Qaeda falsification device at international level and " consequently its operational capacity".
Investigators estimate that the cell, within two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that incorporated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations took part, apart from the Thai services, in other European police units, so in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar to the one recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand another took place, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones leading the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no detail has been found that connects detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the "commando" constituents who killed 106 people.
The police have taken a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally exhibit to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and who manage to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he obtained 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to get loved, because the candidate for CiU requires that at least one of the trainings that will be exercised by the opposition abstain in the vote of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being Mas' conversations with the rest of the political leaders are Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converges to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders shared their bets on diminishing the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and eliminating the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the Mas investment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidarit Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The Geriatrics leaders La Caritat d'Olot (Gérone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people whom he was responsible for in the meantime working there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to bring the charge against the perpetrator" for the dead but "legality and responsibility compels us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer in order not to have detected the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he continued to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one clue of imprudence on the part of any person other than the accused".
The person already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her to die by injecting her with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the Centre to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila did not lie by saying that he sought for her first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them injury as he had already admitted he did with the three women he killed in the interval October 12-17.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the Trichet threat yesterday, which warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the peripherals have closed down and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by close short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw from liquidity measures and it will have to retire tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary future liquidity measures and leaving unlimited access to the week only.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will continue to be sold at quarterly auctions with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even give the signal of intensifying it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, God helps us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they stated that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published in Ireland.
Estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to submit yesterday the action plan approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve itself with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to appear him".
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will contest the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm never ceases in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "the noul de droit", the court council of El Enebro next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia company.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of the group.
The founder of the larger holding of business services for companies does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the management organs of El Enebro.
From its board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who became directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which was registered in the Register of Trade and Corporations.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of tuna in the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is called by David Álvarez as a "desperated remedy of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly fraudulenting the Law and abusing the law, validating and correcting the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis so that, once the assembly is held, it will be contested considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless seeks the use of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for a dispute for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selected universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the descent of the last season, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
The German Sebastien Vette, not only the ability of the Renault engine to drive his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform him into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturers from around the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding any defects and preventable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 high-quality young professionals are working with powerful computer equipment to analyze and project all kinds of changes to the disease.
Siemens' leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's disease except the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can switch from virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the sole limitation of this technological development madness there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bulbs in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
Staff for this duty include 580 people, including two pilots, Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put into service its participation in circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notorious.
Factory Technology Director Steve Nevey said five years ago that R+D's progress in racing cars could be said to have brought 50% of the victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while drivers bring 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20-trade network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain in the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president Helena Herrero gave an example of the refurbished store located on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American Group prepared a plan to establish 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, which includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones opened were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be interactively affected), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assisting, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on "fly" a million customers at his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will try to compensate partially for increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million individual customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will hold a three-year viability.
The objective, in addition to surviving without needing to use FROB's public subsidies, is to earn a market share by capturing one million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can get out of the bank - its great task to be accomplished, since so far this bank has damaged SMEs and companies more than the individual customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while companies exceed 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year his Optima master plan, established four years ago, even though initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be their main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't lock the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he asserts that in Spain "we will ask for bigger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "increased greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but rather than what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed again the speed with which restructuring of the sector takes place.
When the merger of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Fund (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Banking Civica is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 going to 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Argón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he said.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million assets is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed it to those who question it as a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that began a process of concentration "very important" and "go at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had well taken advantage of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary in tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without a professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of EANA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks it with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outbreaks of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, incorporated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, although now it seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable stream of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done ( fiscal rigour and stability plans for public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, she was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time forcing private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has rushed the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells all of us that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare that they have ceased payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater tranquility to us.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we have been given until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard him of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with large companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the the thesis that it is necessary to put order into the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, we cannot rule out the fact that we are abandoning an overburdened monetary area of countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The Russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The horrid expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has resulted in a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
So, and since Real Madrid will eventually become the leader of its group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next game of the Auxerre dam game and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho and the players involved with two games.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that has emerged in this case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honour and on past occasions has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to its dilated history of hysteronic and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit the principles of sport, i.e. if these actions involve a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions that comply with the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of the goods to which we all allude with the right game is to prevent the team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the real Madrid players' action is that they do not agree that they are normally characterized as fraud or fraud of the law, because their violation of the rules has not been carried out secretly to try to avoid sanctions, but their action has precisely tried to be as evident as possible to receive the arbitrator's penalty.
They waited and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the deliberate mistakes examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put the rival in a situation of disadvantage and we do not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the outcome of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cardboard that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated immediately and apart from this, with this action players perform a penalty match and pass into the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the cards occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, recording the steps, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which still includes strategic decisions that encourage the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose rather the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without delaying or escaping the penalty.
Although the boundary between engineering and the fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I believe that there has been a clear case of engineering.
The controversy seems to me to be due to two factors: because there were two self-expulsion and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes back, the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis led to an offensive your price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To conclude to complicate accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of the Holy Sylvest falls Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting thus far an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation is, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi de Restoració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the employer now does not dare to predict how the parties will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to fall a step down with the crisis, so that the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions in the centre there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of applications for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the environment, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the particularity of the calendar assumed more anticipated reservations, even as early as the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies once again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronate (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even though customers "negotiate as much".
That is true, hope for holidays has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear programme causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details offered on the content of the talks and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the area of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main concerns in Washington.
For example, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferator and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high level of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the officer that "the Pakistani Army must end up with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number a senior anti-terrorism officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate at Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer Mark Stephens ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20 the international police corps based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free way to arrest -- which the national police body must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who issued a letter yesterday denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange applied and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world seeks him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't shut up.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spy on the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "surprising and absurd".
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
The trial of President Barack Obama's spokesperson to reduce the importance of Assange's contrast with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January requested the Department of State to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute any person providing them with contributions or assistance".
Again further went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back to his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"The one in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eyelashes to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the final internal revolt within ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot at all give him headaches that he had with other extinguished currents.
That is why the leader of Escerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelashes that allow him to burn himself to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodys want to send a certain vote of penalty to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his or her person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified by half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than making his position available to the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that will be submitted by management to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress in the fall of 2011, which leaders consider safe.
The ERC leader admitted that the "polyphony" affects stability and its objective is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its family room linen.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologue, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlighted two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militia, i.e., include new figures that come from the dedicated Carod sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows for the holding of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Convulse Conclave commissioned the management to review the assembly model at a specific convention to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the moment, the time could be good to resume and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there has been a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in organized crime theory.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on the Rue Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early on Thursday morning, on the fourth, the owners of common land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Calano-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was killed with eight shots of fire when he was leaving his home to initiate the work of collecting barley.
On November seven, two subjects of 30 years old, were killed by a headfire impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front was found a man's body on a solitary path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a shot of 25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorado, the hands tied behind it and the eyes bandaged.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot blow in his neck.
In half of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, at the same time two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a bag in black plastic the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the morning following the location of a man's body in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck was found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acautla.
On the woman's skin were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the dead bodies of two men with their heads were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and detailed its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent before 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16, assured.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that its country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and reinstate its industry.
In fact, he explained, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese Government and by other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps by savings lamps and another mitigation and adaptation project, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific advisor on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and plans to make it another similar around 2020, he said.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as state governor, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he explained that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach for local elections that have been successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; rather, "we will like it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would no doubt be able to elect the best leader that Action Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the post "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the relaunch recorded by the party in the past elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next fight, even though "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes have been made about them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of the cabinet," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no staff in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes the law for paperless students on Twitter
"If you agree with the consent of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted the US President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the consent of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted Obama.
Its short message maintains an open cyber link with a broader document that requests the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of tax reductions in Bush's time and government funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican Blockage of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he was going to request a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act supporters require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his term as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the largest obstacles in the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants spread the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (while another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "...we put ourselves in embarrassment", launched the Argentine writer softly to the public, most of the young, who had met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and to whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shutz later defined as a great story, with Luisa as the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "plaie" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectious scientist she gets convinced: " patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut off his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is opened in reality, the symbol is the scar".
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling narrative he called Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he spoke of a famous sorcery that touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a story that turned to speak to America, the great news that had from the beginning her own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Some people who invented us all (the writers) made fun of false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked the smell."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the story belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its height.
This is actually called the 'Cervant tradition'.
"It is because of his inheritance that we are what we tell."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table He owes it on the wound.
Cuba-Portoricaine has put its own on the great plague of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the author.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must be on the wounds of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed as well in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that runs to the advantage of dogmatisms, "after each assertion there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking about cartoon, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman on the hunt of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had tops and bottoms in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
Argentina ended up consoled with the sub-champion medal, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reigns of Morelia with which he lost with a overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 closing he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournoi, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered again a reverse, because his team played an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to get away from evil so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers many of the finals, of which he asserts that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can take is that until the referee doesn't breathe the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to draw us were already ready to run and I think it's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular deadline, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it's the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, hands he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will not get in that situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to be no longer a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People must go to Visa Applicant Service centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cut of waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the visa treatment procedure at the Embassy and consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
The CSA staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will present certain benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a need to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on request (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for trade and investor visas.
Those wishing to renew their visas will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest SAC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be collected in the CSA, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boltines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate an astrobiological discovery tomorrow Thursday, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, at 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too toxic for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and opposing 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce it.
The 60th had just settled in when in Congress an opposing bloc was appearing led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before beginning the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them,
With this reform, did they repeat, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MPs, in addition to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Director chaired by PANISTE Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally, the political marginality of PRI and PAN is constituted.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme from a political will and if they do not, they will again be served by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
"So far it has arrived (the opposing coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and now they talk to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has plenty.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that the Congress has now become a 'good' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the Member, to give his place to the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave us with out-of-the-counter agreements that will probably be 9 Members, now the five that we see, separated into different fractions, we decided to join together to find a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they did, that they decided, we are out, and we disagree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Municipality of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos favors Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With the latter, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in a concept of "settlement of account suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and therefore how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Northwest had published a revision of the cheques issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the City to pay Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a creek of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of Zona Dorada's Association of Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities to replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists walk there and see the disorder and avoid close trades.
"Politicals know only that it means closing a business one day and they don't know the fortune that is lost, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hostor José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Mayor.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not only make the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist zone must be maintained, but as people who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city properly."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not paid them the attention they need and this type of fact highlights something that is known to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, stated that recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that have to get online with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Thankfully Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP demands results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a decent and free-of-agreement labour law between parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faced with major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two PRD, one PT, one Convergence and one of PVEM, totaling 40 popular representatives, was installed.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are clean and committed to society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and become the carnival mask of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I call for them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor makes progress.
"We will ensure that they do decent work and especially engage with society and sectors because Sinaloa people have given them their confidence vote in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association des Hôtels Tres Islas, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, as now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators attach the importance of the Government's budget to strengthening the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruent as a major economic activity and generating currency and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified for detonating tourism projects that help to ensure the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation could not be resolved.
We're looking for king magicians.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a deer.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Cologne Salvador Allende and they live in the day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with 'plebes' for sale in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaida, aged 4, wishes for a doll or a bicycle, and her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests large clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive', he remembers with sorrow Cayetana.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, aged 11, shoes the size 12; Isaiah, aged 10, shoes the size 10, while Miguel, aged 8, shoes the size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six sizes would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
About ten searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hasch, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons had to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These investigations were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Quebec Security Estrie, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Agency took part in this police operation.
The clandestine migration can continue without problems
The draft Conservatives' bill, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships responsible for illegal migrants, is obviously going to be beaten while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year's possession of any person from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected criticism from the back of his hand that his party was not firm enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against smugglers and that is what we do through another bill, the C-35," said Ms.Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees and imprisoned children for at least one year," explained Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians massively tell MPs that they do not tolerate such clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections due to its rejection.
However, one Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote so that each Member who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argued that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as of January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Pakistani public security critic Stéphane Bergeron to call this ad "breath out of a hat" and "bricked solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, he just claims."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest refuses to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests that Quebec give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escort is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from Operation Marteau's prosecutor, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this case.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck the bikers' groups, although the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently adopted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road went wrong.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
Sectors north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations should be added to the melting of the already accumulated snow in some sectors, several watercourses are feared to overflow.
Warnings on flood warning were issued on Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareu and Acchigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood surveillance and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken over due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on an alert stand and monitors the situation closely, said Annnik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
For its part, the Quebec River Forecast Centre issued strong warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, including Maskinongé, L'Assumption, Ouareu, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially Blamed Dupont
Quebec's radio animator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial reversal before the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial comments on social assistance and Haitians as well as his gross language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that did not suit broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CNSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebec Joint Social Assistance Front.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must provide solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le noon" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been held in his place.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a media face-to-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
The cheerleader of CHOI stated that he had made no donations to help Haitians because one could not know for sure that needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension above."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the cheerleader.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing mounts on the world's tatami and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a commission for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur Championship (WKA) from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now I'm getting ready to go to China for the World Cup of San Shu."
"The fighters who finished among the first four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth-ranking tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san Shu" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China where punches and feet, as well as projections on the ground, are permitted.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will definitely respond to the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly gaillard."
"It is somewhat the equivalent of the Lumpine Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec willingly awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor firms that gained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without tenders.
This consortium called Energy Management was set up in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium took over the lucrative contract without any public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is the new way of collusion and cutting down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it in an open manner," said the Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard at the press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she gasped, claiming that the QP had been "bad" and had "missing rigour".
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The project is under way and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week's Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector was investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the business register in Quebec allows the number of more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens of them, brings back to one and even legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energy Management, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s."
The great owner of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made a sneer at the fact that the project's management contract was granted willingly.
"If you call for tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in that market and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has expanded 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Energy gerance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 management contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau made it clear that the QP is also linked to these firms that "finance it", before stating that it was rather about its leaders.
Responsible consumer barometer - The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and eco-certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, even if it bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption push, it deplores a lack of credible information, lack of which it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, indicates the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another observation is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications based on the so-called fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that are considered to be responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speech on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information appears to be essential to stimulate the current consumption of nearly one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the lack and uncertainty of information would ease the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also claim to be suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services they seek to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and above all to change the brand of one or more products to meet their convictions.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from their neighborhood merchants and preferred the purchase of food grown in their area, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 over a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Consumer Homo of Quebec likes to appear as the King of Recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers reported having used public transport or called for carpooling to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which had just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only with one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, which expected a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full film vocation, do not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to engage in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least from the opinion of sources from state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been reviewed downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who piloted the eXcentris dossier.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposal reached SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift must really be ruled out.
Recall that the Quebec Association of Film Owners and Cinema Parks opposed a direct investment from the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
However, a number of environmental stakeholders called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of candles, has for ten years taken the cinema of author in his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to support his clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, run a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, one of three screens, Le Parallele, has continued to broadcast eXcentris films.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on 27 February next by designing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of downward proposals that have been made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the veil over what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they also betray the feeling of their superiority towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, based on public space yesterday, offer more cross-cutting details than substantial content to get under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in the middle of a federal electoral campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanation of this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal everyday issues rather than bring this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the elephant proverb of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands at least this "sudden silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Surely, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when voting."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, Business Manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the trust vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," says Mr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties rendered their conditional survival to the quality of the proposed relaunch plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcasts at CBC refer to the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, where there are few references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the abductions for the CIA's muscular interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let us note that spirits are warming up on the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the responsible for this massive escape should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
In Cancún yesterday, the United Nations proposed a renewal plan for domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which corresponds almost to a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments for reductions by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED", in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, the major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should move global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract 5 Gt from this balance to stabilise the 2 degree centigrade climate by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates as heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last from 6000 to 10 000 hours on average.
New LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves for fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place seals.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "without delay" publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce provisional results without further delay," said a spokesperson of the UN Chief."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional announcement of results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results three days after the election on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the CIS President had stated on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulous" votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
Any election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were chosen by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denied any connection with the former rebels, considered "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go to claim the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that bringing complaints before the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The president's second round, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ITB) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (9.7% with overseas departments), showing the adjusted data of the provisional seasonal changes (CVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the population working in the metropolitan area and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% by including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the ILO.
The seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini under review and in detention
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, head of waste processing companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and breached at the Luynes arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini was examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, suspicion, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue it for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP prior to his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the strong PS man in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, held, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday evening and swept away.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to handle.
As to the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about them, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Agglomeration of Aruba, was examined on Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition of encountering the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts to him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of liberty," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial review, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued for "transaction of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Agglomeration of Aruba, Michèle Duval and Christophe Brindisi, are being examined one for "removal and diversion of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guerini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "rescindation of abuse of social property".
Among the people who were faced with Mr. Guerini was Stéphane Brunengo-Giard, recently involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies that they have used money from big bandits.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, investigations focus on the conditions of allocation and operation of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Abagna and certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "pioneering", held the opinion in haleine in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the eye of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going as far as giving them advice on the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not had to compensate for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place in clear light the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to establish the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Elysée's adviser for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do so as much to repatriate their own nationals held by force in Iran.
"Besides the noise," they say, "Martella constantly" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, after the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day it will take refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he tells us that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States calls for extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released to Paris on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who is tracking Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear equipment, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
Elysée said not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There were strong exchanges between the French Presidency and the guardianship of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision," he observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
Elysée's advisor composes a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through press releases and "futes" organized in the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and observe that manipulation bears fruit because several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the 'blitz' media of French officials".
On what is based on so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, the Embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggering the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called Cinderella Act which will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to call on companies to limit daily access to these games for young people who are asked by their parents to do so, he added.
It will also provide people who claim free software to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared with 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In full torment due to suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of Fifa designates on Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the queen competition of Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities included in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Crayff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
Backstage treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined his country's chances, the cradle of football that only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the OJ-2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore the British blaison to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (towns, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong in the 1994 experience, appears as logical favorites.
The first world economic power, the seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a long advance on Japan and South Korea, which built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by Fifa, which would in fact diminish the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has come out of the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion to new lands, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (because of the time shift) by European countries, the nerve of war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had pretended he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate to Elysée calls it another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not good household with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to pretend that the doubt still exists.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
Let him speak before MPs UMP, Tuesday evening at Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown some feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his application?
We were far away.
The president simply recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the Presidential, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebello in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think I'm thinking about the next step."
His words before yesterday make him no more candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the PS application, on the one hand.
But it's not Segolène Royal's high school entrance that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, its candidacy in 2012 is clear that many PS demand an earlier than anticipated battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the PMU on it," he immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, pointed out.
Euro: the ECB forced to keep its purchases of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities of the crisis exit or, at least, to announce the termination of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that Frankfurt's issuing institute may not be able to afford to be so peremptory as to worsen a more tense situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)."
On the eve of its hearing in Brussels by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissident about his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "was continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of further procurement (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a significant change in headings.
If lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still proceeds to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she significantly modifies her program."
"Unless it would be taking the risk of new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to animate an atone market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace itself with the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a mix of yields paid by the most fragile states," testified an important mandatory manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilise it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government does the roundback
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline of the compulsory rates to 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
Upon leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unspeakable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person subsequently denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy cover contracts (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in a certain amount of inflation in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "very concerned" by "the turbulence of the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the dependence of the tax revenues that goes with, making the State at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... whereas the budget under review in the Senate is estimated at 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be put in place after parties, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short and long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padian.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period of poor decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde also hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it has still been demonstrated on Sunday and at night, are obviously supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State obligations brought water to the government and the ECB's mill.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade the debt rating of Portugal, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it faces, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations among the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are on track.
This is also for the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the outcome of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a round of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first securities issues of the ESF are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative entrusted Reuters with US support for an increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The leading countries, Portugal and Spain, as regards them, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both parties wish to avoid seeking international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms that are essential for lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors discuss the options available to accelerate the process of normalising sovereign bonds markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber put forward the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of the leading European sovereign debt market, consider that an extension of approximately EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments in orange surveillance
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disturb certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure and Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snowflakes affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are sufficiently remarkable to generate traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only if necessary and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was prohibited for Thursday in Picardia.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefectures "invites all drivers to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their behaviour accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% to Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick airport in southern London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, the billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of its double loop funding from the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, reviewed in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the start of the money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is digitized: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a realignment of a tax on offices that already exist "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're close to $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the GSP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards, we explain it."
"This will be included in the budget and taken as long as possible."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still absent subscribers, may lead to a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by the regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is exclusively made up of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and the caricature sinister profile of Khadafi has long been for artists of cabaret material to sketch.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism only believe what they already know, and who reaffirms what they have already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) the head of secret services (unless he could be, I know, editor of Liberation), who only retain what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every person cultivated already knows, that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the Heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises of representation, have become spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world brings a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal doesn't put both the victims and the "bourreaux" in so much crisis.
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So in Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, having been able to control each movement through the telephone, each transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power eye.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected revenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret of secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - it would be possible to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is as obvious as with current technologies, it is futile to hope to maintain confidential telephone relations.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction falls within the scope of science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials moving discreetly in due diligence to uncontrollable itineraries, being only bearers of messages learned by heart or, at the most, concealing the few information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key-closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving in crabs, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegrapher revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogiques) had allowed film researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going forward and back, and discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digitals) allow them to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while flying, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the communication policy and techniques return to the horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
It is now the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France bidouilles its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine compliance with the promises of quick and early fast-start and early-earned funding made by developed countries.
And the big French biduillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and valued at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with equal precision.
The EU announces that it has made €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission considered the year 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start financing.
Other countries have selected similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or at the overall level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ borrowed equals 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At the most, should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has only such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice walk-by tour!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand, on the evolution of action over time and on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it is believed that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in negotiations since developing countries are not completely dupe...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are recorded will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of a kind to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Child Pesticide Alert
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (former Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the low number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September foods generally consumed in four meals and one in cascade in one day by a child of about ten years old, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as friandies, were examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the base is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as almost twenty residues that could disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as incas by the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide which is nevertheless prohibited in France.
Even for Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even bread baguette and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminants cocktails" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "increasing civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of them in cereals.
