European inflation has slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, is primarily due to the steep growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in November was higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 per cent of October - annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave as likely 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the grounds that the decrease, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the 22th "must negotiate" trap on inflation so that it does not subsequently have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, struck the record for 12 years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of food and energy prices.
Quotas at the end of wheat increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and milk products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 percent current to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the party's safe voters - due to the strongest of the opposition's voters - would mean more than two thirds (71 percent) support against the support of one fifth for the socialists (about 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is about two percent.
Among the safe voters there is one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged especially bad the economic situation of the country, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population is experiencing the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth of the population expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was doing better than his duties.
13 percent of the respondents trust or trust much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the respondents.
54 per cent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent does not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced towards the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October unrest last year 35 per cent felt it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, whereas the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the participation question replied that they would surely participate and another 20 per cent said they would probably participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would participate with certainty and another 15 percent would probably believe their participation. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of educational rights, 79 per cent of the medical services and 84 per cent of the hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electors would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase of 16 per cent remained the hypermarkets of the Budaörs commercial gold triangle, with the difference that VAT had not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdasag
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the thousand HUF.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared", so there was no dramatic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price far below the nine thousand HUFs, today they can't even do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola with a redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, regarding last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the most expensive basket values of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas in prices the increase in VAT was felt.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the circulation of a product, it may lose an important benefit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher by 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only an 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, since the price now highest has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent of the price of essential consumer goods increased.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some essential foods, recorded a price increase of over 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases just 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all products, large quantities are purchased, while preserved foods are taken from pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, large queues were formed in the three stores in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income remains below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions prevailing in hospitals, bed overcrowding and staff overload do not favor the control of infections - says the head doctor of the department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are saved.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient was soon returned to the hospital as a result of MRSA infection and has since been unable to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10th of this year there have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents - said Karolina Böröcz, the head doctor of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, but no information is available.
Nearly two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, namely Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-oxaciline.
One third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections produced by the SA (e. g.: inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, cutaneous infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied excessively or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and quickly infect into inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia first of all to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened organism, to the elderly or to people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic Resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff attends them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalised patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to avoid infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, but current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of formation and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients who carry MRSA into their body.
However, taking microbiological samples is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This fact is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases go out to the public when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the head doctor of the epidemiologic center department.
The European Union makes strict commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Antibiotic therapy should be addressed, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent resistance to drugs from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of travelling patients or in primary care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks is a very important role, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by drip transmission and direct contact between people, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Furthermore, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although in order to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 metres away.
Unfortunately one can also experience - Karolina Böröcz added - that in economically less favourable hospitals it is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are carried out, fewer such infections are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Sickness Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
According to the data provided, MRSA infections appear to have a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control by the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
It is possible to rule out the possibility that drunk or in a state that has been stunned since the fired police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a transgender - reported on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control that he had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the steering wheel.
The then head of the police station in the XXII district, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle when bending onto the 21I district street Kossuth Lajos hit a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian-designated area.
(This last fact, in other words, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way to double.)
The transient lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and applied for retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case investigation is under the responsibility of the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be made from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project at Debrecen University.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes with the EU the details of the Metro funding, they will again deal with the issue whether or not the original contract needs to be modified and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this will take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buy on the EU's even cheaper market, will quickly take hold?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred objective for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach cottages.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estates also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, Sofia's capital may be attractive, both commercial and office spaces promise rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best road to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100,000 euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category is chalets buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 German holiday destinations).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is increasing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
The Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Foundor reported that meetings at expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at ministers' level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, up to 2012.
Discussions on the particulars between developing and industrialized countries are currently under way.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures for the moment, although it tends to reach the agreement that compared to the 1990 situation until 2020 it decreases by 25 to 40 per cent the emission of greenhouse gases.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a steering board composed of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac é Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Foundor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, regardless of whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit itself to a reduction of up to 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within which 15 EU Member States committed to achieving 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent in respect of the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will implement - notes the press release by the Ministry of Environment.
This is much at stake in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because otherwise it is certain that its entry into force will be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol will not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the Earth's average temperature could not be prevented, because according to scientists it would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general Kandahar operations body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers who have been loaded this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name "defence headsquaters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the British Community (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally uploaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda hardly costs anything compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the BBC was declared by the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - but they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos appear in the distributor, for example, about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, although they do not present the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with video game shooting, downloadable for free, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tomb and bowl salted at the Christmas party of the ministries
The Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire 2007 with salad cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so have fun power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited the relatives of the soldiers who currently perform missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday environment at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred Ministry workers, approximately 300 are expected to attend.
At the party of the portfolio there will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, they will also act artists and there will be soccer draw.
NAF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday at the National Council of Justice Administration (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the departments of the NF are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA since we cannot communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the NFA party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not collect anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to [origo]’s question they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to dress or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
It is counted on the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will only take coffee and salad cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply provide their colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for local governments and territorial development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own act hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget you will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The farm portfolio will offer a New Year reception on 20 January, in the Ministry Christmas will not be held.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which only the specialized diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief speech of greetings from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the unemployment rate will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be stopped completely and workers of the Collective Transport Company in Budapest will also be on strike by 13 hours.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike commission of the Liga and the National Trade Union of Engineers will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will be pronounced on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly approves the public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible to vote only on the public health law at very late hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike to be launched on Monday, significant transport difficulties will have to be encountered: in railways there will be no time to work indefinitely, in the morning some of the collective transport of Budapest may be stopped and more than half of the inter-urban bus transport of the Volan companies.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for definite time.
Until Thursday evening the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas parties approached, more and more people were traveling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. workers of the Collective Transport Company in Budapest will be on strike, Budapest airports from 7 to 9 a.m. will hold a four-hour strike the Liga Trade Unions of Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Education Unions called for a 2 a.m. strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation which will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advance pensions, the possibility that occupations that deserve it may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country there is increased risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has from various points of view increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the highest political risk is that "with the worsening of the ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that this was due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave public debate about the Roma problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on existing discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the Institute of Research, the National Guard's activity, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of the country's stability and democratic development."
They remind us that since the fall of 2006 there has been increasing publicity and momentum for the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been established in the country that have self-definition of "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they are self-defining themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - they add.
They stated: all of this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
To highlight the civil and form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the perspective of neighboring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in such a way that, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent in the face of the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations which certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced will constitute their own guard in order to resist.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Capital Politician.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász said the news agency's question: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the risk change, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the coming year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Parties are not even united in the EU or in North America.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national parties, state parties and holidays.
The holidays are primarily related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that they can rest those who have spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May the festival of work, on 1 and 2 November we remind our family and friends who died.
In addition, in our country are two-day parties the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often made bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends so, during the previous Saturdays you cannot leave work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
However, it is not mandatory for service companies and institutions that, due to their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work may be altered only around the festivities of the end of the year: from December 24, life is virtually stopped in the country, because according to experiences, most people "make bridges" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the work party so that, for four consecutive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23rd: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming during the year-end party will be able to rest, since from 24 December it will not be worked anywhere, nor even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissuasive girls to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass on to us without realizing: they are all part of our everyday Folklore at work.
Whether you adapt to minor discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others is a matter for you to decide.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been wanted by the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a date?
At best you feel it and try to fix the matter, you might as well call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is solved by apologizing.
Before proceeding with boring explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and consciously strive to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they're right to be mad at you for taking away their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted before time.
Chismes about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have on the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know about him.
Are you going on sick leave unwarranted?
When you call the office on the phone and say you're sick and you're unbearably hurt your head, you feel bad or well, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think that others should do your work, your unstoppable tasks, your work in the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something might happen to you, so you have to stay at home, tell them, so your colleagues or your boss won't have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughter, telephone calls
You're stuck in your job, but you're suddenly getting your colleagues' giggles out of it?
Have you accidentally heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to it?
Do not bother your colleagues with your bullies, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them over their heads), patals, constant blasphemys, expressing your discontent in a loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
You blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished anything in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Do not allude to the eventual chaos prevailing in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can make amends!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: I was very comfortable for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Do not see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation permits!
Don't be rude, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning hangover.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll raise the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel reproduces the Sugar Wings of Love song.
National music life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this block when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and although the rock style garage again is fashionable, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are news under the sun.
Balázs Zsager began his career in the city of Pécs, played in Yonderboi as a whole until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, dancing and pop electronic music, he tried to succeed, when he was asked to soundtracks [b4] cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the whole that at first it was only acting in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of being sold in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released record entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference about the aerial, about the flight, but besides the aerial of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenaris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radios the high flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Well everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Zsager Balázs: The definition of the public selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There, not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow their path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work as a team, trust the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable that our work would compare with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and then started another way.
hvg.hu: On the success list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people listened to Zagar's name for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our album.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of sound soloists from our own national musical scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodossi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - who was then baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly compose the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the album, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song later learned by the girls.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited at the time, but of course I needed the Divas too.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and at the record looks like the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they don't have their own role, they all sing together and not stronger than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply because of technical problems.
We consciously didn't want to distribute papers as soloists.
The song also pours on it, about which we forget our ego for a while, who from where he has come and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have wanted to get others to feel that euphoric state of mind that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, but when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, gradually everything was put in place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with concerts and because I've already "released" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A traitorous bag runner risks billions for its inferiority complex
An disloyal evil-doer.
This is what his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare with his colleagues and undoubtedly with good abilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was allowed to hear from his superiors, the same ones that they sent to the police.
But what comes from Kerviel's responses according to what French media translates, like Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than €1.6 billion thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Exactly, in summer, he was able to win during the US crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her come early in the year.
In February some news was started about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past and would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and wager correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their earnings exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, "that nothing has been left to him at all.
Throughout the interrogation he declared that he had misrepresented the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became beneficial
Was he afraid he'd come to find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk it like that?
In my position, we had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already a scholarship broker and in 2005, he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I'd never win as much as everyone else did.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already observed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions he won, during the bombing attacks in London, playing a 500 million euro title at the bottom.
And this was a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all of this or rather suspected of it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they track him down?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of achieving 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes there will be approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be destined for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly-entry countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the President of Nicaragua, the court ruled
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal issued a 20-year sentence for the country's president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the 100 billion dollar defamation (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison for house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again in the ranks.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the prison officers if they let German finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German was constantly transferring government money to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, as prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential one, calmly adopted the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it conceals the rivalry of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State budgets of the latest Social Democrats' governments have suffered from three shortcomings that for this year 2008 it is not possible to resolve so easily:
The first is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of agents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, taxes and credits of the banks, often issued, without sense, obligations with which they disproportionately owed their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we adhere only to the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has passed through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is boasted ČSSD.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to place an order on the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to become indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that, within global measures, we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have been futilely filled with gigantic measures.
And although they succeeded in eliminating some of the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform change will be the end of any policy in this country and, ruling who rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little we can say that the policymakers who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
For this reason, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on normal expenses of agents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who rule to become only officials for this reason we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and taxes, the tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Mark will receive more than one hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders, banks undercut interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultant company in his report to customers.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions of losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what they are still waiting for when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's leading economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to pay more dearly to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times in the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Reuters told Greg Salvage of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to light the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Environmentalists' Debates Are Amazing · Global Voices
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus expressed himself again with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he commented that ecologicalists' debates are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, "I often only meet with the caricature of my ideas."
Now interested parties can be informed about their diverse views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate constantly changes and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, it considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and so they failed to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials can spend time up to the end of the year on issuing the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year they will be on the roads hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid card.
According to traffic, the meat has not changed mainly those who no longer want to drive.
While people announce a rapid decline in the exchange of meat, the metropolitan offices are filled with applications and interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 daily customers.
The queues wait half an hour.
In Prague the new card has not yet been taken out about 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new sheep lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who must change their car and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid carnet will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infringement with a warning.
In case of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be paid to that person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to receive fines of a thousand crowns at most moderately.
According to the voice of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should deliver the driving license.
Simply bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meats issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should slowly change the other types of driving card.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a definitive expiry of the reduction in penalties, for the first to one year, and for the second to two years.
Detectives in the department were going to complain about organized crime at first, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is awaiting first the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes, a total of 16 years have already been sentenced.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 persons in the robbery and today the higher court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were invented cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The prosecution relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without permission of arms.
In the home registry, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The criminal group, according to the accusation, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pňt and Maroš Šulej, who have avoided the trial for now, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change children: 12 million
By changing children in the Maternity House the counsel of the families affected, Igor Veleba, wants the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal, does not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve such a demand, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty sent us to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissionary value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň’s family wanted, for each month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the expert's report, except that it was developed at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men even though they fought with recriminalizations for the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at Třebič's Maternity House last year, on 9 December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed at the Třebič hospital administered by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they may ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far recognized them with proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute over the Kingdom of Valachia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava he was the first to use the Kingdom of Valachia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not present herself at the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polivka's popularity," said after the trial, Polivka's lawyer.
To him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valachia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been working for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about directing him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was given the opportunity to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valachia.
From that comic origin it was a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia society.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to the visitors of his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaqia," the judge said.
He added, however, that Harabiš and his team are in the spirit of the project.
The collaboration, among the now decomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, became the singer Jarmila Šulaková, as the mother queen.
In 2002, Polivka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We don't have any hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can introduce himself," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
I really never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its walking characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better on the market.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and I just think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, which I will not suffer before the two meters long.
Flying around the world
I'm going through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here would appreciate more the invention of design although already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi the so-called space shortage in the header disappears.
Suitcases
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the rear gate down) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can spread to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, it has a capacity of 428 litres, which compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot remains behind its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's car, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the flat that remains pretty flat after cutting the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four valve injection ignition on a 1.6 l capacity and 88 kW force.
And actually that's how it should look like a 1600 that would despise the family's five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the škodas then which seemed as if the exhaust tube was covered by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 by 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags on the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the complements of the team in the Fabia and it will reach a quite similar number.
Now there is only one decision for which of the two marks.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and for that reason, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children are increasing in violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and jokes among students have already reached their own parents.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after a two-year-old girl attack on a Slovak emigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began spitting at us.
When I told him to let us do it, he gave us the help of throwing apples and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of America's conquest.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, on broad avenues running cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio they left their signatures the stars of the world of the spectacle and politicians of all America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita surrender you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel you will be mixed cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already in worship in the 1950s, so far continue to work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived a long time ago have oxidized between these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating considerably, it does not exist in the surroundings as many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places were metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly valued by rail lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar plants by narrow means in steam or electric machinery.
Their cabs for decades have not been discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose models brothers in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway farm there is a museum that for those who love the writer, they must not stop visiting it.
The Vignales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone pilons and rocks of high escarpados in the fall of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure habanera factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone might find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was rolled over there.
Trinidad
The old town of Abolage was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places nearby such as the Ancón Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in western Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful city on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by its own path.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known one, the Yunque.
Café, rum, pure, Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pinos, Cabaret Tropicala, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, Santeria, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, of all this could be filled many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment required is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as planned, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to begin economic and security development alone," the defense minister Des Browne told BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year in 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which the fourth is in the southern part of the territory.
However, for the United States, allies have reached the same limit as for the organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly ask more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
Likewise today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's a little," De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assisting countries in recent months, there is a controversy as to whether all allies make the most in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for liability.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vaguely.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," writes Sun in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend itself 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic grew to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
However, since June it has decreased 13.400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economics confirmed its data on the debt of the early October state.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Throughout the past year, the State owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the boundary of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, saw this: "We could pass the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see that change," he added.
Doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The state's debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
Internal indebtedness of the state grew this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million crowns.
The external debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion krona z since June was reduced by 13.7 billion krona.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt of the first to third quarter created 13 percent what is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all from the obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
The state debt strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion krona due to improved state budget developments.
The amount is, above all, composed of the deficit of the state budget which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, 43 billion crowns for the financing of state obligations and 1.8 billion crowns for payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
He compared today before a court to Jartum for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insults to Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm to 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of letting students from 6 to 7 years of age give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was liable for a penalty of whipping.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, according to the Jartum Unit High School in Sudan, has been detained on Sunday in her home and charged with assault on Islam and sediment, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints by parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, " tells the principal of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of every 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear itself - it had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that he asked children to vote for a name ", he said it was just an " innocent mistake " .
Opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who described her as " very attentive to her students " and " never speaking of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
No agreement had been reached on Wednesday on the future status of the province during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session on the future status of the separatist province on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
" It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status " , declared European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was " at stake ", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period ", he added, pointing out that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated to 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was in charge of a new mediation by the UN last August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the pursuit of negotiations beyond this date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of administration of the Kosovo UN, the Westerners consider independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced Kosovo's President Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last-opportunity negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade's plan of autonomy "was part of a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic, for his part, considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade said that it was particularly afraid of a " dominating effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia " , stated Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: on the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush starts an Israeli-Palestinian agreement
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he himself met on Tuesday to Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything he could to help them complete a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties ' obligations to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three major serious problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future Palestinian borders, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
Going up to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the forthcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set the end of its " two Palestinian and Israeli " co-existing " vision.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , Prince Saoud estimates in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in this type of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car drove on Sunday, shortly after 17 pm Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
" He was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green bike of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorised to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a failure of the ceda the step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcoholemia practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the disfounded front, cracked windshields, broken bumps) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " involuntary homicide and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, cocooned with the departmental public security management of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the IGPN investigation at this stage ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the police version, namely that this minimum cycle arrived relatively quickly on its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the friction of the socks on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed the time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just then?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious shortcomings " in this regard.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which we must be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments following the accident.
One of his windows that exactly gives the scene.
"Let's get down immediately, with my cousin who's a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "to a completely frightened policeman, who was limping.
Two others tried to reinvigorate one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people were present from the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, relief arrived " about twenty minutes after the police marched " .
They also practiced cardiac massages in vain.
" I will not assume that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," said the prosecutor.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police suppressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyer movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the people to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste to which they swore an oath in front of Musharraf ".
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
It was due in the coming days to speak on the legality of re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's judgements," the judge declared to The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " no longer appreciates " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared on Monday to the Assistant Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denounced the country's insistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterilet still present a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed for a better " fertility domain " , according to the institute which notes that the index of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of every ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for the spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky output that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness from the living modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuched" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing anden for modules-laboratories.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a power generation module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacement, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module that are 76 meters wide.
And that's where one of the panels, which spread out as accordion, has been damaged in a little bit of a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who initially had a control exit from the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go snail at the end of 30 meters of length of the shuttle's remote arm added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been charged with "operating" the "wound" solar panel.
After inspecting precisely the damage, he sectioned the fail-safe cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had remained close to the air ban and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-stick of hockey wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapuched" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher to return to the Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aircraft and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditiones the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus " , announced the home of the European builder EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds with no further precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational outcome of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming its aspirations for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today directs voters a television message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself to hand over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and open elections, without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign manipulated by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is never "had such dirty choices, until the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of the world of jaque Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are forbidden visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates had until 23 December to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, the outgoing power will succeed in the legislative elections as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo, they don't feel ownership of their destiny " , sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg went further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic eviction ", says María Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " willingly renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What should I reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, neither will the extremists vote.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54 - year - old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his rights.
The eleven managing States - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for searches " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening up of these nominal documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental illness of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest orders established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, if necessary, to provide proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest to a part of the scientific community.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University Technische Universität in Berlin, declared in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade is already about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free-change agreement in 2008, said the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will do a lot of doubling both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans ", said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants change annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services " this week, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for its eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the base index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an unusual duration.
" To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , states in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market so on 6 December at 1215 GMT, at the base index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the indexes " of interbank loans per day in line with its base index.
The interbank rate per day was Wednesday 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was set at 6.6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with an important penalty rate which had deterred banks from resorting to this.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS Party's bids on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including an increase of 50% of the employment surplus, the restoration of the TIPP (interior rate for oil products) floating, a cheque-transport or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of Articles (180 to 115), the session was held at the end of the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between a majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," entrusted Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as " more inspiring event " to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked persistently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of the city of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-ranking policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones is after.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that has recently taken place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after having unmarked itself in the scenery of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are being held rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", such as that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the rock taste, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His companions of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"It must be prudent, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The race for festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The Oskare race has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether from Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the Santa Monica poster and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock? Experts, divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the closure of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in stock market usually has positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties occur in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking the alley in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect fled to quality values both in long and short segments".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed types is unknown, given the high level of crudeness and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say there's going to be rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," said the expert.
Ibex lost about 4% from the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Still not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that take place every year on these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "we could therefore see a rebound of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the United States regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, states that "this year it touches on great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some constructors "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco ensures that the climbs will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low-income month.
The real year-end rally was held in 2003, in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the flash of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent score.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment Ibex rises by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it manages to have its year-end rally.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the People Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's experience will be decisive for other entities to focus on this initiative that is secondary to trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that pursues Popular with the project.
Capture private customers moving around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, autonomous and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches that already have in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers from different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the timetables is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring is not a major investment, even if more staff are hired, since there are about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, explains Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' said Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the value in Stock of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain that led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect of her joy was: 'it hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've dropped less', she said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss in what we have spent the year in 15.66 per cent.
The value in Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches the €4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, who gave in 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a downturn of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (five-day editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we cost it in terms of hearing'.
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa, the subsidiary managing the group's advertising.
If this announced data became real, the television channel would record this exercise an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million of the financial year 2006.
For its part, Antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile asserts that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to please our shareholders, whom we have already given value to 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time of certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their profit estimates on Telecinco by 4 per cent in 2008 and in 2009, by 7%.
It is explained that the projected income growth has been cut from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3’s forecast of gain by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability by dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Box Madrid: you see Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintener) for the 'multiple attractive' and rising business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to override in both cases by having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consent to the best rules in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activity of entities in detail to ensure that markets operate efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services both to specialized firms and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial service signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms on the market and requires them to keep a record of all operations they carry out in order to facilitate monitoring by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congress's Economic Commission, a number of amendments were incorporated, among which points out that debt securities are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the US debt of high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates can perform in Economics and Business 30 years after the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and the collection of customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices evolved in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data that is comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released next December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and economic minister Pedro Solbes said that the rise in CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he hoped that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We were hoping for a figure around 4%," the Minister of Economics has acknowledged regarding the advance data today.
Virgin plans to collect with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped more than 50% to £12 billion (16.800 million) since the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was stacking record deposits above £25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture about a quarter of the income in British banks that are deposited over the next three years to achieve those remaining £18 billion until reaching the target of $30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his outstanding advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested mayor of Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) this morning at the first hour of the morning for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption outlined this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May with Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then the governor of the municipality, and according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, it could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and the Urbanism Council and no further arrests are dismissed in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption, was charged at the beginning of this week.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' Member Juan Morales, therefore spared, was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the purpose of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the PSOE by Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
He has also pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over Congress if the Socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made public on 15 November his decision not to present himself to the upcoming general elections and to abandon his career in active policy to fight climate change in the university.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who would preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono expects to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and with rest is Congress, the president of the Government on some occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and he has not wanted to see him already occupying his position so as not to fall into what he has pointed out his opponents might see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subject to merciless persecution both to the skeptics of its predictions and to those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is the president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in failing to comply with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has occurred, and why his Government, the government of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to make it clear what measures will be taken to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has neither been nor there will be such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costious, uncomfortable and threatening for corporate and individual accounts.
Even the cent of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impactive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands nor demands, but adorns the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we ride by bike or cool with the fan.
Arrested by the mayor and the local police chief of Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the mayor's secretary of the city council and a hotel manager for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at home and has been transferred to the Consistory, where it is currently located with numerous agents, who have also visited the Town Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three detentions are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galicia Nuaria company to build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Totana's Number 1 Court.
The first six detainees have been brought to court today.
According to sources, the former registrar of Totana and today autonomous MP of the PP, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former registrar, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur vigé Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Immunuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is conducted by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would entail the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the sharp parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

If you think so, let us let the Book of the Month rest, see if we have another ‘premiology’ and other competences in the meantime.
I'm already perping something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way in the head of the PISA report on educational levels in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there was, curiously, criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Professor of Education in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

One colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Discharge Crimes:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs in the shop for less than EUR 400, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains less than the tax on discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous kidney is punishable from three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be punishable from six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's going to get his hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor gives me one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what their peers earn.
The study has been carried out by magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if both were to receive the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if it took so much science to conclude this.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals from the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague for eight years.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla goes with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain free.
His names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla (2006), not premiered in Spain, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, continues the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What's the point?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the car, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it's just, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured person.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in return for being held liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the meat, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer from an accident, more likely to pay.
That is why both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of accident due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have reached the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some type of percance.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver needs to study the situation carefully to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age are faced with various disadvantages when hiring an affordable insurance, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
Precautionary drivers can opt for a full risk with franchise so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would imply that the customer pays a portion of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the amount of the claim that the customer provides will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid disasters to the extent possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the company's base rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can be allowed to increase bonuses", clarifies Noguera.
After the 25-year-old strip drivers have it easier to hire insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Young people cannot normally take advantage of the experience previously acquired when it comes to an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but does not have children yet it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation permits it, of course it is.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of accident, so the charges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risks with franchise (possibly EUR 300), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle’s life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, a risk insurance is recommended at any risk with franchise (which is EUR 150), or a third party extended when a high level of bonus is available.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to study adequately the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the eight
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the 'Champions' league, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete with the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie on the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and would ensure a better crossing in octaves.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because on equal nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the Scots bitter at night, who trust to get into eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after precisely defeating in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the move.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rsoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is worth only the triumph, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into octaves and to continue at UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the Vancouver GM Place that the group meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the entrances to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowd that overthrew GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our costume, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "by the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon arrival at the airport, they were awaited by an army of midwives.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (5-7th December).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of affecting the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of Russia's gas exported to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute prior to last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, gas monopolistic owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more as it has committed itself to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine might pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told the news agency Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on traffic rate levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must try foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record records of employees from outside Europe, said one vigilante.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it has.
However, its report noted other controls carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after collapsing a jeep at the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged bombings by car in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, among other measures, that the Boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
The president of the Scotland BMA, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities declare that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the Auditor General warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanrkshire and Lothian were being widely implemented.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, stated: "I had a great interest in doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biographical film about the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal."
And the protagonist of Bond, Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The prizes were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's promotion of fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn also won, already known for the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded with two awards – to the best director and best debutor.
The rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about the vocalist The Clash Joe Strummer, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was brought by Viggo Mortensen for his role as chauffeur of a leader of the Russian mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The Fifties, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently film the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winston said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, star Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who planned an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
One cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said militants had planned to smuggle eight drafts into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudis travelling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the Allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as objectives residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, since five months of work," said the spokesperson of the Minister of the Interior to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote " Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing financial support and support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been a suitable place for life, declared scientists yesterday.
The data of a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin of the Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is sufficient to melt lead and is eroded by stormy winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is clarifying why the climate in Venus is so different from Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seizes "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, declared to be enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000 sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's unworthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record video questions and send them for broadcast among candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday afternoon, November 28, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey that asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in front of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to applicants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-on-one issue, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to come up with the dial when they heard ideas that they liked: the transmitters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchange of words at night was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing former governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China's toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he said that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul's fund-raising campaigns, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two of them have come out of the bottom, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
No influences appear to have been sold, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor are extramarital fingers sucked.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour Party, of more than GBP 650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped calling for an election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr Brown has become Stalin to be Mr Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative hat.
A three-thirds of retired generals launched a riot in the Chamber of the Lores, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably on his way out.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and not focused.
On one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Although I wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock problems and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as a Foreign Minister.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blairish's counter-times - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly defrauded.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it dissolves in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis contagions other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already shown.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million jobs in its American consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Mortality and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of persons (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore delay) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for lenders were getting worse.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts pay consumers each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expired.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditor's capacity.
They can even work to leverage the transmitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortising the mortgage will decrease if the properties are less than the loan value; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders may face, changing interest rates or changing credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retaliation.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction of credit push America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
You have to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were tried for their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud by colliding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of the employees.
They were tried in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, your case marks the vague end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests by zero, but the three British knew that it would value it upwards.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its share of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers paid 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
Three British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was under way.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business appear successful.
The collapse cost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with crimes last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither downstairs nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Fier, representative of Gulfstream.
"But nobody asks that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents."
Mr. Fier was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millonario Fair, an orgy of four days of consumption held in an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition booths, hoping to attract new Russians wealthy towards all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in mahogany to diamond-incrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Fier looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the nearby stand at his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel by the rise of oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at its height.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think think think.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attended the fair for the first time alongside the Russian brand distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit he used as a veteran card network disching with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cuts, Mövenpick ice creams, tables for swimming pools on sale, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was sitting patriotically in a stand of the Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a reconstruction wall size of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the richest Russians of the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the brands of limited editions, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, Director General of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170.00 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car grills in the form of a chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roller wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, won't necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) filled with stacks of counterfeit bills of one million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 false tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on lots of money, or beating a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
"chapuza" surgery could cause a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up through White Cape Cod, two doors below West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, there was a car from the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, which is not yet identified by the police, but working at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test even though the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help to solve the mysterious death that hangs on the top ranks of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo had been assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-Police Officer from Newark who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died after an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said the house came about 3 P.M.
From November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead in place.
It has been over a week and the authorities have said little about your investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a Marchy rosal is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian thief at the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the door of the coach, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in meeting the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch over this one or that one," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's embarrassing."
Federal reserve is expected to cut the fees to raise the stock exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm the credit conditions with interest rates, which were increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the Central Bank of the United States.
The stock exchanges were posted in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by improving the market in late September and during October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make further cuts of interest rate, to stabilise credit conditions.
Comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total labour force, in a global reduction of costs to compensate for the losses of its investments in US subprime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to close to 13.289.40, while the S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to close to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's first-order companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was above 2.3%.
Before, it was highlighted the reappearance of the tension of credit on the markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, strained the credit and three-month "Libor" loan rates between British banks, meant the largest raise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara into trial
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important in the face of the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection who is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's office, director of England, is beginning to fill in offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sports too.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, because trials are required that always end up subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tube" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, they would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricket player, unless they give you the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But getting the eye of the selectioners is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared himself to fit and bowls as the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first class wikis in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiriya stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played on each test and did well in the first ones, with 5 kickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to settle at the same time who became an important player, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion at today's session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his home as a middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" some momentum that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He took up nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for the British car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked away, to say with excitement: "Did you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it is including your slippery pass to have effects on your plays that seem to satisfy you, as it strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as suggested by the tea leaves, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who had lost cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus on an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned on private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he declares, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to stop for a moment.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped bring Al-Qaeda out of its bastion to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordanian newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been led from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that an anti-Al-Qaeda militia had begun in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades."
"That's why I'm back today," 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi declared.
Many said they have been attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troops consolidated groups of "worried citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighbourhoods.
But many claimed to have returned because of the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from the Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring forth sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Spaniards lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fifth time to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle on themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system that in a study by the German Economic Institute (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their university career here with two or three degrees.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students coming from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillery.
"The system of vocational education is exploited in the Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Economics Institute (IW).
More than every five young people do their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of engineering science graduates has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering science specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the students' performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of behind-school students in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, Sarre didn't get much better than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they can achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the secondary education institutes.
Chávez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets change the schedule in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Currently Chávez is falling like a comic book in Spain.
As reported in the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed on its day the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to hostage-taking action.
Left nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power could be greatly expanded in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas concerned with the release of hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This sentence was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by left populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decrease in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
Experts present a great deal of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," said the journal "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomy and Research Institute of Economic Cycles.
The new burden of unemployment insurance may also correspond to employees.
The Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent as a year passes by, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a German Social Democratic Party politician.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3 %.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlwinds in the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays run from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, tells Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if ever there was to be life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institution.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface reinstate temperatures of 500°C, swaying in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, just for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the researchers' opinion, stress not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also demonstrates that neighbouring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had imagined," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the South Polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds the wind flows in the high earthly atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also called sunrise star or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus amounts to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets there had been a swarm of water that remained on Earth in the oceans, but in Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellorship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, he stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in making a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of Una China policy.
China also knows it," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
For example, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Foreign Office caused great misunderstanding in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots such as those occurring in France.
Battles with police in the streets, shootings, car burns: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals fired guns at the police: after severe riots caused by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to look at the fact that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop into the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This concerns not only the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It's still early to sit down at the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
Young people were involved in serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded more efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an impersonative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
There must be more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"You must give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a lighthouse helicopter overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday through Tuesday about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's realm.
The performance far away from the Federal Chancellor's reality, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more has to be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After its desperate, indifferent and unrelenting action in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach he was reproached for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy proceedings, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive sentence.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
The Lower House stated very clearly to all that such reproach was appropriate.
There could be no slightest interest or feeling about the country's problems.
Instead, however, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
An example: the prevention of climate change: very much praise was given to himself for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he's engaged in expressions to get people an impulse.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without leaving the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's kingdom the internal problems are low-value appearances.
Children's poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
All you do is talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to supplementation for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, faced a heated debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
Already from the beginning the tensions between the candidates are noticed.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning him into "a shelter for illegal immigrants" in New York.
This, for his part, replied with grave reproach: "I would like to say that his own home was a "gate" for the illegals." Giuliani answers to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group has no clear favourite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
Small 30-second videos, shot by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, have not much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's criticism of his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown their death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important topics of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains and asks for forgiveness from people and the television audience for having been an abortion defender in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the United States.
Eight years after power was done with an unscrupulous military coup, the former general for the first time ruled the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the position of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the State Attorney General, after the Musharraf oath, will cancel the state of emergency very soon and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since he was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many lawyers in Musharraf. Last week, the Supreme Court of the country rejected all remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
In the meantime, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured.
According to information from the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Krautrock's founders are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s followed its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
A copy of "Live 1974" which was written at the best time of the band was made as a restarter.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the sensation.
Each one of them has before him his box, his cables, and above all his buttons.
In the middle is seated Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What we have to rebel here is this: the questions have precisely shown that the name of the band was falling into people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the mistake Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Can 2003 band in Cologne for its work of life, the faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band The Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years ago and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a 16th century ruin, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
According to them, one day a banner of Ottenstein's harmony association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griesem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Rother then expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia had.
Live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanks to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Snow! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures at the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There too is Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock's influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effect devices they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is the same as it had to be.
Three people who go deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment he coughs, whispers, and at a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in the music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (Clusters).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
The scenario reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
That can break one's nerves or give a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Or the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the war in Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was rediscovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the prettiest man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles today have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his decadence preserved so far most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful movies about war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acting very fast and that also leads him to love her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was actually never a good movie about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about American reporters in the war who are going to detect a criminal war Serb called "zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that cannot make the army and each time it becomes a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when Simon Hunt is introduced to us at first, to whom he is not simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisages a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnia who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who went to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his face I see, sharing feelings with him, which hard is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it's hard to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star gets involved in a region of crisis or in the mines, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood calls for a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some films need more time. Classics such as the war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time each massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The great dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that so bad was actually the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When he was asked about the parallelisms between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that we must be realistic in estimating possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, declared on Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city has encouraged as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective the political, sporting impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in the organization of the Summer Olympics did not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's request for the Winter Olympic Games of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which so far we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let go of the opportunity, if the plans are ruined right now," said HSB's director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement by the head of the Senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German State Sports Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as "a replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the Federation of Sports of Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party Fraction (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking advantage of the time so valuable for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed with the development of the small district of Grassbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated planning of Olimpia for small Grassbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics generated a great deal of enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They're not the wooden boxes.
Those who relate the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type"-bright-box on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum Museet in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost one hundred of the others of "Stock type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the red, blue and white wooden boxes, with the same sample as they had "Brillo" soap powder cards.
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Modern Museum Museet were exposed hundreds of cardboard boxes-bright. These did not make them Warhol (because of the expenses), but they were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only some objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol made it possible to produce in Sweden a wooden box-bright, but were not exposed at the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the Stockholm type authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulten and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and crushed their tight silvers and then painted them in oil with brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990s copies shows that the painting was applied with a roll without printing directly the tight silver. Moreover, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the Museum Moderna Museet and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in Julio The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which these are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had crashed into a hotel in Manila have been surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter who could not answer for shedding blood.
The soldiers loyal to the government had attacked the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been huddled in the building for hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the Thursday trial for having attempted a coup d'état in 2003 which ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could suddenly deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police officers who were supposed to watch him had moved on to their ranks and followed their riot.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People are sick," Trillanes said.
"We call people into our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who used to lead the elite army Scout Ringers, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great government critics called Thursday to a major demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been reproached for corruption.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at coup d'état against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the actions of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an share is EUR 14,46.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel further.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (digital subscription line).
On Wednesday they made the assumptions about entering into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third partner.
United Internet already on the day before he participated with almost 10 percent of the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch in the measure of capital expansion placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros from them.
In addition, companies started negotiations on product-DSL marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," said the spokesperson for United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be content with the participation of ten percent of Freenet and do not use their right, i.e., they participate to 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet and Drillisch holding directly had 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
