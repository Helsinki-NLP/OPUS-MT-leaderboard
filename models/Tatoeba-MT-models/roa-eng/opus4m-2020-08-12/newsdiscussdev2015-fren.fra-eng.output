I feel like I'm a typical rugby club.
At an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know about in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's common in rugby is big anything...
Yes, we finally don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break the nose of anyone during the drinking games (at last, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted in black for some disguised evenings.
I never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme that says.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond misogynous jokes and jokes under the grip of alcohol that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to cause as much.
You probably don't know anything about it at rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for whom the competition rugby is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
It is very different from those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are "misogynous jokes" acceptable?
It looks like the rugby club of my university, I've never seen racist behavior, but the nude races across campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body is in part made up of this ancestral water.
I'm gonna win it quietly.
So this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:) is also ancestral.
@lux You did not read the article well: a small half of the water in your pasta is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, well one can suddenly consider that the food fleet has on average more than 2.3 billion years, which is already not so bad than that.
A great foot of nose to the catastrophic and warm-upists of any hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see Serge Ferry's outstanding work funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What proves that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for "catastrophis" as you say to worry about the disappearance of oceans but rather about the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know fresh water that accounts for less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species but especially the reduction of little or no renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that sustain our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study you quote and make the generous effort to quote the source, there is little doubt of the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to freshwater problems, I assure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you must stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the ozone layer hole is closing quietly (estimation at 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and unreasonable ecology, no thanks.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a perfect dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, it's not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign indicating that 10,000 good men would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
I certainly don't!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving back, sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% CO2 more than any climate model allowed gives priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been flattered.
Have you seen the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear Government.
The CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is increasing, your argument of plant food is just a fallacy distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but that doesn't mean it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is flawed and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to marginal voters.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants perform less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people must eat them in much larger quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this Member is childish is evidence.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from breaking the rules of the XVIIe.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for not bad people, even if the NA regulation is not a tax treaty.
If this lady does a whole affair, it's not her honor, it's mostly like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined everyone who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Académie" had blurred: "Let's say Mrs. the Guardian or the Keeper of the Seals" (post that so far had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure machismo!
"The political arena" .....!
The sandpit, the rear court of the Republic fills, the marigot of the operette mouths , the table of illusions , etc ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people taking real risks, good will, bad will.
Qd the Ummpiste phallocrate is based on the label and parliamentary regulation by twisting the + elemental civilization under the false umbrella of good manners, the sanction applies to it "it's quality" for its partisan stubbornness and its mesuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's doing the provocation to get him to talk about.
So far he was unknown, now he can pride himself on being known as any cancer of a primary class.
The high-back academy and we can see that Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to focus on solving its internal problems and stop causing cockroaches and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you get her to tell what she doesn't say.
This Member of Parliament acts as a college student in the midst of the teenage crisis, who makes the provocation and whose friends go, in their delegation, to see the Principal to have the hours of college cancelled.
and defending him on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this forum of MPUs.
Mr. Judge, I appeal to two expert witnesses for a few thousand years to separate.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otaries, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that it gives them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we love the majority of our 80s to work, to move and to shop.
What a strange phase we have achieved - we are able to multiply by two our life span, but we pass the majority into boredom.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily implies a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go look for, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that a lot of crap is being heard about animals that are "playing" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game is not just "useful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play based on any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Maybe yes, hope makes her live...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, be in good health and today to respond to an article when you had to drink the information without being able to react 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be rather enthusiastic about those who seem to be mad at first.
But when we see what many have learned at school, especially among the most likely audience to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the least beginning of anchorage.
"the most likely public to engage in attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rose, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thinking patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's disparate youth too!
If reactions were no longer responsive, Twitter would no longer offer to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything about this at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not my intention).
Do I have to be lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do we start reading life when we can't read?
And do young socialists go to the suburban schools to teach men and women equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing assemblies on Twitter, but we should get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're null everywhere but to teach moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article is not going to happen.
It's not time to make jokes about the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a double meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill a 90-year-old's stomach in a retirement home.
How come the more we pay, the less there's in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more dishes.
Of course it must not be so.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they made the effort to put on napkins.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good dishes?
Is the Manif for all only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's it: some kind of homophobic gathering.
But that's not all.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "making children".
A child should not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery farm?
Where do you get this?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacture", you have to claim the prohibition of WFP for heterosexual couples, it would deserve consistency.
I am also surprised that the so-called "for everyone" manif has not yet this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not the only cathos that manifest themselves: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This put it, it is nevertheless useful to remember that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all the evolutions of society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violently raised against the gvt's will to admit girls to school in the name of "defence of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents have shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school has become mixed.
That is the credit that can be granted to these people's positions.
No need to be catho to get angry about the marketing of the stomachs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom ceases to be that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have as much right to love themselves as others.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this also applies to heteros in search of GPA.
I just can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of wild stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has set, I will not talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa bring or didn't bring anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why it won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Bothham77 hodle1 October 07, 2014 12:48 Recommends 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney right now so you can forgive yourself for doing it too.
That said, it is good to note that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive passes in 93 games.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive passes in 96 games.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really watch football or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve as much selection as Rooney and B) would score as much goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's skills criticism comes from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be regularly selected in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's (even not an attacker) football qualities with Peter Crouch's?
You're not kidding me?
There really are people completely in the mass.
Please also note for your governor that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his British team career.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've got to write that down by making fun of it.
In a country where the arms port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people have a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those of this school just don't agree with the U.S. weapons port authorization!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the crap: the girl is five years old.
How many kids are playing with fancy guns at this age in our house?
Does this make murderers in power as much as they do?
Even though the arms port is in the American constitution and it necessarily affects the country's culture, I don't think rich boys are significantly different from ours.
A bit of common sense and saved reason svp.
It's an disarming process!
Give yourself up!
Information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have, a cure for the taste of morbidity.
Could we assume that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of five?
If people need psy follow-up, it's more mabouls in this school than students!
Let the parents get their kid out of there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely sick.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the USA but is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His Relative Youth?
These brilliant blue ribs that men wear have nothing of an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled-up sweater.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but it all seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Contrary, maybe?
But what does that look like?
You got me ahead of you.
I would have thought that a thin knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "Ostracize," he meant "Exhale."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a gray suit, we could advance that their intention was to ostracize her.
But not here.
It seems to have been corrected – odd. Perhaps the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone wanted to mention something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "Ostracize", which meant absolutely nothing.
The rate of unemployment in the United States has still fallen in August, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
To live there right now, I will say that the United States is getting closer to the explosion as inequalities get crazy.
The political system is literally damaged by the state of funding of electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that we don't imagine in Europe but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago English financial circles said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forget the essence.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards will not be able to give the change yet...
Based on the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "trick" or rather morph.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad causes him to lose even more support at home?
I probably can't imagine.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Labour's shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the moose, it's playing 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed "to feed the right-wing nose into diversity"
Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the safe by-election against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this return of movement, the pendulum has stretched far since the end of the war, and I imagine now it will start in the other direction.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safe seat of Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen far worse, but for Labour it is a victory for Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "Victory" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "failure", it wins the battle!
I agree with Jack, it's a victory, but she's skinny.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice from Canada, Greenland and northern Russia.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered as well?
In general we need to see the Earth more "pasteful" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a "simply simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground crutches, the pressure on the coat is relaxed, which gives/gives a) a whip to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "fowl shot" or the ease of access to the serent surface (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa Regarding climate warming, I think it is prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendlyly, Patricedusud, does this volcanism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Is it prudent not to warm up any more?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we see less good.
Hello, the end of the last ice period was also accompanied by increased seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain ranges where on the highly frozen continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Co-ordinately CB
Too often it is not known that the Earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or fall from about 30 to 60 cm, deferring, as it passes to the zenith, as it does to the waters of the oceans.
This means that the slip of the tectonic plates, as well as the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bag, especially since polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, thus causing a change in land balance to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am am amused by this "human," saying the Supreme Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created him and whose separation became so damaging, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who exceeds it in the organization of his very viscera, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking of collaboration, money.
Earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's coat, which is made of solid rock.
Personally I find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Long live the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a totally great 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely enough, almost no one remembers now.
Too bad you've never been past the first impression.
Your loss...
"The frosts, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been made several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to have eyes in front of a brain in a mouthpiece.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Perhaps there is a support group for you, that says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be itself, in itself, therefore non-conformity.
But Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it was just the premises that appear, today individualism structure the whole society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass"!!!
Without making it an inexhaustible horizon, is there any connection with the Cartesian approach to examining what one receives to believe, what one believes to be.
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to and claim.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
In the context of the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked any progress and reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that stems from behavirism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anti-conformist, it is to fight this decoupling.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, let's ask some...
Blacks and Rebels, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who see each other in their mirrors.
Thanks in any case to his controversial arguments to put under the light of the news Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports increased inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will it take to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business councils, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on the "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once he has passed the weapon to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are the ones that will most certainly pay the least inheritance tax through super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
It will be worth £100 once he has passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
It will probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it is worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only accuse him of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and the imminent collapse will end it, he and the others of his doom.
His "rich" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded £1,000,000.
We all have to be imposed to pay essential services and repay debt.
I agree with you exdionys.
I do not say that the discipline didactics is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement for the teacher of math she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other than quantitative approach.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to creating a defiance relationship that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => 1 training in skills to teach.
A job that's learned, of course.
But pedagogy is primarily an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
Pedagogy doesn't match even when we're math teacher!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real vocation in the bcp of those who kiss the teacher.
If gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer discipline teaching) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways of addressing a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students whose 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes quite well the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Institutors..
It ends at 3 in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If you find it appropriate anyway to your use of time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit me!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing called player and that allows us to listen to broadcasts on demand when we want it!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a usb-type adapter behind my SKY box that is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated.
Yeah, I think I was wrong in the hours, so I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 o'clock.
Although it's men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, it would at least please people.
They should start getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its broadcast is anything sensationally disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular animators, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show in the evening at the return of work, is not a woman
That's five shows.
So which (of these five) is the most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows that very well, but he doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached these days.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps the whole glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to get sick of it or get lost.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote FN.
For 40 years we have had the same parties that alternate with power and make the keys of the country into each other in less good condition than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnasium, a theater.
But since they don't burn a car, they don't attack, they don't drive, they don't care about politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, these are men's subs, sociology is very good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human foolishness, culture and ignorance as much as it says that it still has enormous growth potential, it really needs to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on poverty, fear of daily life, fear of the other and feeling that there is no prospect.
But yes, you're right!
What a wretched humanity.
Fortunately there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and learned to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
To take the voters for c...
Here's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgotten" in fact there is less and less resource =>low staffing.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen - you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by this is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This helps to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and it's super - it's necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money talks, and if a sex isn't up to it, next time!
Profits make fun of the life you live.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profits mock the heroism and education of children.
If it were a crime, the companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between 20 and 45 years of age.
Well said my sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) should be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows us to run our societies and preserve our labor.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to go back to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take account of disproportionately women's responsibilities when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help a lot of people who have to "check a box".
The tiger is not Russian, it's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and would better sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger entitled to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-planned exercises before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missile in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yes, here you are.
I got the same kind of idea right now.
This is a pretext for arming some separatists to attach China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, magnificent feline and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into a stupid article directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a sheet on the Siberian tiger, but a sheet on the suites of a Com' operation of Putin.
When we expose ourselves to the media so much, we also expose ourselves to irony or even criticism.
The perpetual victimization of the Soviet-Putinian sympathizer.
Holland had also taken full pore with its camel without shouting at the anti-French plot.
Here our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg saint protector of the great Russia has personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he barred...
Hollande's getting fucked up, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seems to be a horriblely condescending idea.
However, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to repeat.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty of the sense of complaining about paternalism.
After all, there's no harm in brushing your teeth!
In fact - basically, complaints appear to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be correct, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a disadvantage in brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking the wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can bite the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guiness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth the longest and judges Guiness at the time strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged toothbrushing.
' at first sight' - very funny.
I feel like it's a rotten experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study will change the habits of participants who knew that toothbrushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include things like double blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person with social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: 1) These are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information about the times they brush or brush their teeth (easily fucked-up results by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits could be passed on to the next generation.
Does the uterus graft impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles some kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as you do not want to have an impossible perfect clone of yourself, is this a priori a problem?
I think it's going beyond the reasonable limit.
The desire for motherhood and paternity must not push forward any further, without the question of ethics, taking risks, for the mother and her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not unlimited and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they wish to have.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tren
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles alone, alone in your little pants alone.
to give them this magic bag so they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it sterilely in my safe if he could still give love.
The current strict circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "one" agreed to reflect, "one" would admit that it was only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
Let us put as an anti argument: cf here these reactions all men curiously....
Marjane, no organ donation has anything anodin.
I've been plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodine.
I had registered as a spinner donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood both for the recipient and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one way or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing to do with it, and it strengthens the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it doesn't have an anode either, and that's done!
Please don't combine Messi v Ronaldo.
It's down there.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's no real competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Deportivo became a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thanks for fixing me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the goals of Real Madrid this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a calm conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the state of the international oil investment society?
I was looking at it on a fucking connection so I can't tell you much if it's just that Valencia defended well and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the field wasn't getting over too quickly, but they played well.
Parejo's game as a whole becomes better.
A wretched penalty released but properly saved by Diego.
A hot messtalla and it shouldn't have been funny for Atletico's bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archeology 524 of September last.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what we become intuitively.
No wonder before we get complicated we've made it simple.
Every science progresses by step.
And "The organ" of the woman who was thus preserved to him was?
Passionant!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a black child mummy had been discovered in present-day Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I remember that the mummy was 1,000 years earlier than the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little awkward about reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Wasn't the desert extending less than it is now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scientist to say it, even without any evidence, to make it a scientific truth: the Egyptians and so the Africans from yesterday and today never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "of his ill-known ancestors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market quacks that preach against the mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people who have Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, not to give themselves a bad image and to protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those of Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good for nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristy place, I doubt it is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say yes, it is important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an air military base and cared for them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals mainly in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing public relations manager like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially it's far to its right and would find its place to the mad right religious in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other right-wing European party to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government has almost everything to do with it.
It's not like someone can accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE employers - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Pr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the ambient age.
A professor of law at the College of France does not seem to be able to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel prize of economy and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before that, it was true when Dr. Villermé observed the work of children aged 8 and 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were being shot at because of a signed collective agreement.
Ah, the good old days...
Your reaction is just as fascinating as your ignorance of the PSE's patron trade is!
Its job is not to know the right in all its ways, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscripts written on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is one example, much more could be mentioned, which illustrates the permanent flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which suffocate the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a client of the Sorbon.
In order to twist the neck to the arch-respressed argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the helvette, a serious university would have dived into the Swiss texts and compared the amount of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of the latter may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
For comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, the case law applies in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is fired, for example...
Who is this complicated??
Do you find that the rules of law (law, case law, agreements, contracts) are in the field of labour and trade in unbearable barriers?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has become virtually immune against criticism Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It's probably time that new revolutionary absurdities make critics cry...
For each Ai Weiwei article I have read recently, you are one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Let's move on to something else!
Go see elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not Communist Party spokespersons, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that AI Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose him at all costs (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who bursts out of the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
True artists make a difference.
A beautiful artist.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate the extremists on any side (including Zionists) must be excluded
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the plot, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly City Hall.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, marginally.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
What does the City Hall of Neuilly intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is going to die injuring a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls on this urbanist to attack him?
Crime apology?
Can't I find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/Anti-Israeli conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe to see in any political decision the hand of "sionists" (the term whose meaning tends to disappear, due to its abuse), these two, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady would have come back to Russia of the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's reporting are even more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on the 11th of September are of a very bold nonsense.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the September 11 conspiracy theory, we talk about cognitive dissonance regarding how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely farfetched truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable to adhere to this theory of detachment (as in the case of extreme religious).
After a logical and inevitable flight forward, the end justifies all the means, even the lie, which is a solid, but it does not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that is what you do for September 11th.
There are still many unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are actually very farfetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow !!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everybody to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - will you drink a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by abstaining from me.
The Government will put an end to the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist advices based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium glasses per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should work together (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're gonna tax them thoroughly, like smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I will continue to drink my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturdays nights (and other nights when my wife is not here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk these days ???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
He refuses to run when we could run and reciprocally.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
To both of them, they destroyed the F1 on the pretext of security.
Let's hope he gets better than Schumi or at least Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but be careful on point number 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit instances that refused to advance the departure so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Completely accurate, +1
I just want a quick and quick recovery at Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that failed to occur between problem cranes and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that this would happen one day, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying it for years.
How the race organisation and the FIA could afford these maneuvers without leaving the safety because?
I can't accept that the risks of the job are invoked or the fault of no chance when we haven't prevented the foreseeable one.
But that was the accident.
It must be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "ban to exceed in the area" but is the first purpose of pointing out a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their foot.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more trapping the turn after and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can get even at "low" speed compared to a normal pace.
But, well, we're causing it in the vacuum here, until we've seen the images, we can't issue a set opinion.
I don't see much that changes.
Are there injured?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there are still jobs where we need to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people who are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals such as bears, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as by charm and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains travel very, very often in one day.
In addition, as the roads often follow waterways in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also go to densely populated places, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, all rail traffic crosses the centre of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on it last night, really shocking.
You obviously haven't read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
Actually, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
However, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Canadian Railway Corporation are expected to visit the next Conference on Hazardous Products in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transportation of hazardous products.
This article, like many comments, impasses on the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforce this fact, or what good talk about the sex of angels?
"God said it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to hold the people?"
In other words: obey the priest pastor rabbi imam and pray your prayers, it will be better!

May His Appendix Nullesque touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way by trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather pale at this time) or that of the free market (passibly supported by the state when it needs to cool) ,etc .
Great ideas arising from religious emergence.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where rationality emerges, the religious is at the trailer and expresses himself in schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods served ambitions even though it also brought forms of dispute.
The theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time did not know the doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a poor interpretation of the "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appeal to the hater of the unbelievers.
Rather, it is the moderate (and fortunately the most) religious who read the texts "wrongly" and retain only what belongs to humanism and common values to all humanity, atheists and diverse believers.
For me, fanaticism is the foolish and wicked application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some of the Koran's verses calling for the killing of "misbelievers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if we do not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in situations of self-defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous among the "sagers".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive thing about this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same injury as the one shown in the clip?
Band of overpaid and hypersexual Neanderthals.
They have done enough to hate humanity!
What they have frankly brought to us besides having outraged us with The Neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this satanic Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still sources of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The remarkable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Allow me to be of another opinion.

Nice effort, Savantcosi!
But you don't know yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher that has nothing to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he is debiting the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to elements controlled by Kiev.
The presentation of the responsibilities suggested in the article without dare to go up to explicitly designate the separatists is in the otanesque line of the World which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the gentle pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the wicked Russians
@SavantCosinus: browser change.
I very well open this page on firefox and mac.
If I understand your speech, the wicked are the Ukrainians and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This ticket has absolutely no intention of saying that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
Alexandre Kastals: Where do you get these details about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
Aleeeeeeeie to Romania!
Aleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee in Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the authorities in place who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperativa", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would launder the money at its will, mainly by selling well-estimated players.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill-advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without penalty), and therefore took three and a half years' imprisonment.
The trial also took place from prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also sends a penalty for trying to sweat (and then conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to sweat were our neighbors of Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I always like that moment.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document implying that the money that the police had confiscated from Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor, uneducated, stupid, cheating, lying guy doesn't represent me, and he'll never do it.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist fools today.
You might think that after the last time they broke out of stadium chairs and shop windows, and where they branded racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have had tickets this time, but not.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to resume his reigns in Al-Ittihad.
Wherever it ends, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County has refused it.
Super article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done this, we'd have heard the left scream like a big sick man.
But as is the kind Hollande, friend of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but all down
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer that a party claiming from the left settles in power.
It is the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they have not been able to afford their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no how)
Should employment policy generalize the control of the unemployed at the beginning of 2015?
I hope that in the backbone, the fisc pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the guugnaders commonly known as ploutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasion, theft patterns, and other malandrins.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or ploutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when we have the class: we treat the population of literates and teethless.
At each new period of unemployment there are dozens and dozens of applications which I refer to employers who most often do not even deal with an acknowledgement of receipt, it was automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support from Pole Employment.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" patronym of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaures or Mendès France.
Have we read here a chained duck article?
It is learned that a unemployed person can remain without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It has been learned that controls have removed people who for more than half of them were no longer affected by unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how control can be made of people we never see.
One wonders what punishment is for someone who does not have access to employment centres or unemployment benefits.
And if one can admit that this reform will allow for more removal, one wonders how it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend the ideals of Europe?
Isn't it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we hunt them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain economic.
The purpose is not to be a "Police of Thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It makes no sense on an economic level.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most unequal society.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt Mafia referees UEFA.
The best solution would be if the whole East left this rotten lucrative organization and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This antiracism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality?
So what the hell is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom come in?
The Uefa should applaud them for playing Blatter's comedy and his men.
This has been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Removed from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would it be hoped that small symmetrical phrases would be twisted, just the story of maintaining controversy?
In any case, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there has been, there are and there will be people who are using to throw oil on the fire.
Decodage would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that this only explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli State.
Decodage would mean that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action should be taken against the overarmed Israeli identity State occupying the destroyer oppressor colonizing
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not for nothing in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian people of his Germanic people (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr. Let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, that's evidence!
But as for Israel, we also need to question history, its allies and its support in order to see the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it may be, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaul was colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
Moreover, the Israeli State defines itself as that of a "Jewish people", of which no non-Jewish can be part.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jews, hence the contentious.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, Zionism must be broken with opposition from both Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized from the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that we must stop ignoring.
Primo, the European Zionist project (councilly owning Palestine) involved the dispossession of the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing biting from the start.
Their tender result will give them what their fingers bite.
He should begin his rehabilitation with small bites.
I hope he didn't lose his appetite for the game.
So many subtleties are tolerated, including racial insults and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yes, I hate all these molarizers.
Football is a contact sport where the heels exist and, therefore, players are injured.
The fact of getting his teeth back into the flesh of an opponent for the advantage certainly does not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for a similar gesture.
This is now the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would be the consequences for you?
I knew someone was going to bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to playing with his teeth again.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their biter.
I almost got bitten by the hook.
A prerequisite for a good school course is respect by students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill this respect to their children.
Parents are more likely to convey this respect if they are also respected by their teachers and their children's schools.
In good institutions those who make progress their students are considered partners, not emm.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teach, educate, learn respect, limits, live together briefly) It is parents to do at least 50% of the rate.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Putting on parents is not operational.
No one really took them.
Hence, the action will remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be necessary for the actors (profs, hierarchy and ministry) to play their role and not to be constantly involved.
We can disband a troop that disbands itself to revive it, not families.
How can we not talk about teaching?
It is true that communication courses make it possible to give the change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the first role of the school.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if there is a requirement of parents, the school provides the education of their children.
Which minister would dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Disappointed article: little information, partial and destroyed reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beauf of the suburbs of the East?
It's a beautif, it's clear, but I think it's Willoughby, and so the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him down and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squarely true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
An actual beauf of the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers wanted to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He goes into a grunt today.:(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis on his hunger.
You would be rather bitter too if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and unlawful benefits for life will forever remain beyond your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then gave up.
At least he's not threatening to hit someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fears about the result.
And so much for employment in France that it has nothing to do, it emanates from vegetables always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially outside...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work that the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or a plan for marpol, there was no doubt that the project would have succeeded.
After that, to know whether it's right or not and how BF will comply with the law anyway, it would be nice if "the world" leans on it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by Breton legumes.
Those who burn tax and dry centers.
They want state aid.
That they don't seem to me to be normal.
Well, to the extent that an army of a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it's normal to expect a coup d'état.
Or then we condemn ourselves to allowing the British to monopolize the market.
It's the choice.
Eternal French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people differ from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short envy.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton flag with crews exclusively made up of pure stems.
With this, it's certain that they're going to significantly lower costs...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "hating everything related to the prog", since they just released an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s," I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he has had varying degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to assemble a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
Curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and quite in the mind of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she fears.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have such an interesting story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good points.
I would say, however, that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it adored progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest shouts "prejudice": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is a brilliant success.
There will always be a big difference between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misconception of society and his rules.
Those who kill him do so from the most just and wise vision and reflection of a society.
That is, they have no excuse.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
We must have the well-disputed mind of the common mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his misconception of things.
But that is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge among the innocent victim's relatives: a false understanding that will never be possible for those who wisely decide on the death of others from the sound and just reasoning of their pedestal.
However, in an attempt to balance the analysis, one could nevertheless argue that the death sentence, often, has committed wild violence, which he was able to enjoy, against people who were very kind, who made free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain attenuated with the disappearance of the one who was the bore, sometimes the torturer, of being loved and who haunts their nights.
Let us not ignore their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this reflection I find very just.
Strong and moving article.
Asnin's Marc, he's showing great intelligence.
The heart.
That's probably what I've read most just for a long time.
However, we thought we read stories of another time, old things, that the barbarism of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that clamor, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Same for the other two "Excellent American Romancers" quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all perfect.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's that about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this painful Bellow, who received him the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we should have an American winner, we could also have a racist [leger].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "gene novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homily Joseph, on the other hand...
Who did you read?
How many books did DeLillo read the anti-DeLillo?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll end up underworld someday.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be conflict...???
It's just interest.
It was a trait of humor, "the law", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady acted in SON alone, and absolutely not in that of the institution which she represented, that we wonder what the word "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not warn him of the danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only seeking tranquility.
Flood areas that become constructive from day to day when a large construction program is going to start there, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the flood plains near the rivers.
We were told that "today, there are no more floods thanks to regulatory dams."
Now, you need to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer, here, interest?
Take out the calculator and you'll dream of the life you could have been in place of Ms. Babin, the 1st Assistant UMP of La Faute sur Mer and the former president of the Urbanism Commission, who grants permits to build!
The two mothers of the triumphant Sarkozysm are the old and the real estate.
I'm on the left and not at all friendly with Sarko, but svp, no low politics or low blows all azimuths, we're not in there in a battle of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
US cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what the fuck are you living in?
The U.S. is not a shithole.
Yeah, U.S. cops are hard because of the roots they're dealing with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever do anything, but the cops "come and fuck 'em because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that such an incident is needed to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've had a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant, and in fact it's you who don't pick anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it's not idle speculation).
It is very likely that you will underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension is rising on this issue at this time.
And therefore, the boundary between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in various ways, hence the treatment suffered by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and I am shocked by the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the people responsible, make them talk, create confidence.
That man goes to Elysée has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is cross-checking, verification, analysis.
And here we understand that the sarkolatras have a concern to do.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of antisarkozysm based on the rise of any documents (a non-place and no condemnation) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates(2 referrals in correctional), two journalists friends of Hollande.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is your partisan mind that blinds you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course it's all coincidence and not remote-guided!!! ...
If you think that only Sarkozy supports are outraged!
From the extract I could read, VA's article only sprays the sprinkler.
I even laughed so bad.
For the rest, the World's complaint is unlikely to come to an end because journalists are not "stricted" to the secret of sources, are they not?
As far as there seems to be no connection between VA and power, while there seems to be agreement between the world's power and journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are well ahead of a state scandal which in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
That is why this publishing house with boises, which says a long time about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I thought the bird would be fine with the smoked herring! <*)())))))<<
It is simply for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I were an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperative, even refusing to give dinner glasses simply because of the lady's religion, she also refused to go into her place of worship although she told her that she was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and challenges it must be admired even if it is a director of pub :) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If that country were more left, it would be communist.
What do you think New Labour has done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS repeats this, the massive immigration of immigrants (in their own terms to fit the nose of the right inside), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-east-permit, the politically correct one that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a centre left and not a communist, I said this to make fun of it, which I mean is that they socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have asked you is specific examples of left-wing politics, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked for, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour had done that was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who are now coming to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another discretion, that of money.
We'll make nice savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still has a meaning in Europe, should it not?
Curiously, the Commission does not deal with unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be negligible quantity.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to fully market the rail transport sector.
At the end of the day, this means that whole portions of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of which has already been the victims of many territories will only strengthen itself.
To sacrifice everything, including the advent of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will need to be addressed properly one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of SNCF.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions feel that they pay for nothing, but not the means of forcing the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste, it is essential today that public resources are forced.
And the huge needs.
I don't see very well what it could be like to compete with TERs!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If so, shouldn't he certainly be the leader of the wolves?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to an end from the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense to start the process of separation between your life and the complications you inherited.
Looks like it's what they're doing, but it seems hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones are surfaced, have you thought about a "plan" of "flee" so that you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a detrimental effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure on the part of the court, they can be resolved.
He looks vengeful and persistent.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to provide support to help her get back to work and pay food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your own resentment because of the way he has treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuing relationship with father/child, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I believe that children will eventually understand who is wrong, if we let them see things on their own.
Go again a little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization has disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
Furthermore, with globalization, the country that makes less so-called social, fiscal and environmental benefits immediately has a competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All policies seek is growth, Growth.
International coordination would be necessary, but by now...
It is not climasceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who warms up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in the housing that it was necessary to build, those who buy industrial products that it was necessary to produce and transport.
It was not climasceptics that showed against ecotax, but truck drivers.
No policy is climasceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But nobody says that climasceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
Political actions (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.) are also needed.
And politicians act in part on the sensitivity of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But good it may be humorous to say that the expression is Terminator.
"The greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but every good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it's about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo du Guardian: How long before someone blames immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the skull that took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.

Or the Democrats' crooks.
Or the Labour liars.

Don't use the word immigration, you're gonna scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their toilets, bury the 30,000 people who die each year from hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and hat, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating AND eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be a dick.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is this a (bad) joke or is it not meant?
It's more comfortable...
That's how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend good time in space making cockpits and rumbling while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The TV reality has therefore not invented anything and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to brighten the world and brighten the media coverage to the Western royalties used to the motherhoods of tabloids.
They may have to go down to the ground to see that we work here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we don't send men or women into space to make jerseys or clowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful to mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many of the things that improve our daily lives are derived from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and comes from space research.
It's just a lot of money.
the ball pen that works the tip in the air (for example write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treatment?
To participate in the manufacture of a second useless product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and it represents emptiness itself.
Ah if the last one played high tech.
Behind the infamous minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to drive the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking of buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think about buying plastic pistols now but who have the potential to buy them in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to misunderstand people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even being curious enough to ask yourself what was meant by the inscription (if any) that appeared on it?
Bad typical reporting, one looks at the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to bring down the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be mortal.
Even the small blankets that are given in fast restaurants can penetrate the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you have stated actually support its argument.
On occasion I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful developments, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worst cost, a large cost (subscription, electrical consumption) that weighs in budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows you to isolate the tables of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy providers in fact!).
Simple but unknown even though more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interested in this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call it and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, testing water-saving showers and recommending the placing of water-saving materials on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce their water bill by 30% (from 150 m3/year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a crisis of demand, it is a system crisis that is no longer able to produce enough surplus (which it would then have redistributed in real terms in terms of real income increase) so that these excesses pay for the increase in expenditure you rank in the category "compressed expenditure".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy is no longer growing as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is completely unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no limit inherent to economic growth, and there is no element that could force, increasingly decade after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows for any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, is transforming, energy is the means to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any increase in energy efficiency (unlikely called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forcing production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not we are able to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only be worsened in the coming years and decades (the EIA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that conventional oil production peaks, including cheap oil production have been reached in 2008.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high density of energy, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it equalizes things.
Take it from France!
Vote No on 18.
Are you a Guardian's webmaster?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Nice work, guys.
Although many English people like to mock Scots when they only lose, there is nothing to say, they bring some color to tournaments when they become qualified, at least until they get eliminated at the first turn.
It's even more ridiculous if you play against them ;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because, now that the "goldish generation" retires, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the 11th season, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class", is David Beckham, a little effeminate, perhaps, but I think if he hit a potato in excess weight like me, he would totally crush me.
People forget their athletic constitution, moreover, by talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never make fun of Scots.
I tend to be surprised watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the night...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class" is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It's about Juppe having a hard time asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean people come to laugh good?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his debtors' allowances...
I am particularly concerned about what he can say in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will consider asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free of charge or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their conferences - free of charge - are real.
At the time of the restrictions on the research budget the reporting of these two figures is upbuilding.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all bright for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
Do I feel like I'm blaming him for making money???
I am far from being one of his fans but, that he is reproached for having wrong (or fraudulently) managing his campaign OK.
But giving conferences seems to me to be quite a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remind ourselves that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Epidemiology Rule #1: isolate.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human life is more important than politically correct.
He is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane to Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain back to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola is getting worse in West Africa, I can see them baning all flights and ships to the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that says...
What a pity that the international media panic about Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're all under threat.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's such a sad journalistic article, so small.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first providers of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and gender differences that could help to combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get in there, let's think about it, let's write, let's not just make a noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you're not able to offer a good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - saying that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case it obviously does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist in the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "maturating" as a world resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, on the editorial team, lets it go?
For a territorial or other election the money does not count.
I constantly read that the territorial civil service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, indeed.
There will undoubtedly be lies and truths, to us to separate the good grain from the ivy.
The Court of Auditors costs a lot to tell so many economic noodles.
It's true they've never had anything to manage the people on Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficits they have funding needs that can only concern and only the investments they make.
By using concepts too vague the press as the World makes the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly funds operating costs...
And as the over-recruitment of civil servants (for example, to make beautiful round points) carries an increasing and incomprehensible burden (compulsory charge until their death, since life-to-life + retirement work), these communities are growing in investments.
Staff Regulations should therefore be abolished, prior to the decrease in staffing.
And also hold the mayors accountable financially.
It is fabulous that the inter-communals should have been accompanied by a decrease in the community's workforce, and it is the opposite that occurs, proof that adding one stage is not effective without removing the others.
How do you want to properly manage large areas like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is up to date, perhaps it would be time to react.
No, they'd rather be stuck in jail, the worst in jail, in the administrative canvas, it would look like it!
Let's even try and stick around, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of Vème led with its providential men.
This really started with Petan.
Then he went on to get to the "end of breath" series coming up loud about.
Why won't they live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the genre "it's the fault of the white people."
"answers" not "answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to pass.
We now agree that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly humid period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of the story.
The current Minister of Defence reported a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to hold the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resign!
in 2017:Transformation into a comfortable private hotel of golden closets for future retirees of the Republic ?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the sick and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military are going to treat the flu of the little one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients sound from civilians, from all over the world?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, travelling outside for the Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had a bad time being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they have access to other premises, has done us no favour.
I love supporting Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of supporters and that until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage resumed by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the CCFC's recent problems, but this must be a good cock.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except some Wasps fans at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the South-East sure to follow them from afar or should they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then why are ALL computer systems not based on these concepts ???
+because a huge mass of programs preexist (cobol, java), +because all systems do not need them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is being the first on the segment.
The work of G.
Berry is about a need for niche.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
Such characters, which work for the good of humanity, should be constantly (the media).
For children.
I know.

But they don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few are aware of the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has dropped.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to salt in the future.
It looks like they're reasoning with Faisons more profits, and let's not make healthier dishes and the best price ratio.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh yes, be careful that people don't have too much clumsy.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
It would be good to add a little bit of sodium glutamate as well.
The amount of salt you have to add to the water of pasta is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Are there any family restaurants and offer tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
An ordinary work accident that went wrong.
A promising young man, learned to steal, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man broke everything and brutally interrupted this vocation.
That he be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
I totally agree!
What a mood!
The desire to discover is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to discover it is difficult to excuse it.
That's why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial the boy's father complained that he never saw his son again but without asking for forgiveness from the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who really is the victim in this story?
What you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty knew precisely that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime he's responsible for!
10 years, that's a little bit of my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make a noise?
Actually, it made a noise!
If the occasion occurs, go on vacation in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
I've done it twice, the wine, the landscape and the food are excellent.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see the German wine is recognized.
However, rather important, German farmers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations do experiments with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is no need for the Moselle region to be recommended - the Franconie, the Palatinate Rhénan (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of German style (or perhaps it is the opposite, briefly).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot of them, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle to the property are so complex, the softness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a hot lobster next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great, superbly illustrated guide.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a summary of each newspaper article on German wine since the night of the time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new Dried Baden that will now accompany the dishes, the red ones that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drink when they were young (heh, I don't really think it is always true or evocative, unless I address myself to the more than 40 years - who, as I say, have seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grazia would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the deplorable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who did their studies.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these cabinets of ministries held by the BBQ, and these decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbograin is right.
It should be done as in the Green Sun: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Moreover, the meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets could be resold as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, for real work, and you won't have any more deficit problems!
For older people, it has come time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, in the process of disappearance, will not be able to hold this demographic transition alone...
So geriatrics, of course, but to think differently than a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole post-war model!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that is best known in public hospitals.
If that symbol falls we're really fucked up.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than at the public hospital.
The solution is more in increasing the offer of public service in other hospitals than keeping a medicine at two speeds.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a fault, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The hospital day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Hospitalization Regional Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizens parents is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is being criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious hard consequences.
Why????
It seems to me to do two weights two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all persecution and ill-treatment and war that will drive people away from their country and force them to come and seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during the civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little supermarket when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbott...
Cameron denounced the crimes of war and the abuse that still took place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils having links with the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for assessing asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that individuals with TTAs be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've been given the coconut so periodically.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
I didn't have an health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been giving year treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes earth.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is still little, we were told that the ebola kills so quickly that a large epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagious persons being taken was zero.
It's weird the more we're reassured, the more I'm scared.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or too weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific fact, the more a virus is fatal rapidly (generally) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signs its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish influenza.
After that is the forty-general to save humanity..
Isn't there anything obscene about making media outlets of Westerners true brave and virtuous, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African ills whose job is not known, bravery, or virtues?
Of course this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but the repetition of the announcements is a terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative penchants would have robbed them of their right to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem really gets out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Future Market Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be a black emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this great Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Future Market Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low-income people.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "liest rodent" and Telstra's final market fund were excellent guardians.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell in the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noted it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destiny for a policy at the end of a career: not to be recognized on the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her town of Toul as being sufficiently high to administer it.
How good the "provincial" sense is!
We live in a hateful time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I am against the port of burqa, but that is not the question.
What this anecdote tells is pure sarkozism: poor tiny ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on every road accident to show that he is a good guardian of public order), grossity and overrecuity brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become unworked to carry out a firearm and a badge, they would thus have every opportunity to exercise their self-proclaimed role as vigilantes.
But who is Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I want this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the blow
Don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, it should be invented!
It's easy, though, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On that occasion, N.
Morano clearly made in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she had before her, and who would probably have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes Madame, of course, immediately Madame, tell me which direction I must run to capture without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I think that Isis is going to get over them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone counted the bodies here now nobody does.
With regard to civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing competes with the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two wars in Iraq would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, older persons and vulnerable adults their lives.
Most anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to defer the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and unconsideredly in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - probably a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not lose time to mark their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's GQ that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine it with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bombing either, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a United Nations mission had been targeted like this.
Good note, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total death toll of Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only figures even vaguely reliable on death related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and are even very suspicious as Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to see the facts.
It was of course in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable believe that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course we need to fear it, but also the gift of games in general.
We must stop acting as though people were pure minds, that love was all the children needed, and that they could be done with strangers that neither the parent nor the child would ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is essential and despised to know its origins.
Instead of making it clear and using fantasist arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or designed with gifted games.
If you learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the games you came out of, you could put yourself back, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances in WFP (e.g., uterine graft) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire of children justify these acrobats and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Just as a point.
It is obvious that we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid issue is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I met with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming disabled, contracting a serious illness, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes a lot of consumption, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The child's desire is not a whim where one could use the other according to his or her own will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
