Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, such as the fourth American president of history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be received, inter alia, by the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have much to do.
First, the visit of the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee who elected him from 172 to 33 organizations in October.
Later, the presidential couple planned a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will conclude with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth American president to receive it, although the third one to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
They are intended to be charitable, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his entire programme, the President and his wife will attend a banquet to which, in addition to Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had an attitude rather reserved for the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochrancě přírody Litoměřice (Society of Natural Defenders Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded the investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesman of the Litoměřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Defense Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently under arrest and is facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate packaging from drinks and containers can be found in the southern villages of Moravia to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not interested enough for this problem.
Brno is totally delayed in the separation of garbage, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have they ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, opposite Potrefená Hussein.
Don't be angry with me, Mr Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that elsewhere it is not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Per vagancy
What happens is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
After a party, I myself offered to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, on my way to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and do not buy any more containers or offer the separation of other materials so Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to the company EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire Jihomoravský Kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" removed money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for incomes, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those ruling in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently borrow for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That is only to postpone the problems for the future, it is to place mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and someday you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If social subsidies or operating costs are not reduced by the State, taxes must be increased.
Everyone who added the left now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get them. Of these accounts, 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the coming year will not be missing in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase alongside interest expenses.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer arrive by raising VAT slightly or reducing maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, the coming year will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and neither can their price be reduced.
The best you can do is to keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the ČEZ dividends, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated $18 billion to the budget.
Every year dividends are liquidated ecological damage, served to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation costs, including in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
After that, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, to take control of the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Statní pokladna project (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and which has already been launched. It must allow you to monitor online where the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and come to sanctions, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone can work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This possibility is precisely the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at a time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualisation and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do telesquisers in Krkonoše worry about snow-free tracks.
Lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and Christmas.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will be snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer of the Spindl news portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a Christmas Eve in Špindler eh Mlýn according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindler eh Mlýn offer mainly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura said.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," mentioned Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer Christmas in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
Also the first fourteen days of February are sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is impaired by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the snowless mountain.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also run out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's stays are already busy at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in Janské Lázně's most recent hotel in Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, as we find about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will spend their desires for the snow waiting.
Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, Jiří Jakubský reported from Hradec Kralové, from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only did the same text use the word "equal as in Iraq" several times, but it did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new road forward."
It was himself, who criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that nothing is talked about today about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the general Afghan operation Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president wavered for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he deceived the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him a further 5,000, although he had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, starting to withdraw Afghanistan's troops in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years. Obama's whole doctrine generated more questions than he offered.
Many doubt that the increase bears the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After that they will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capaz de action", a minimum objective of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is a shock to his volunteerism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit demonstrated that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they don't want to explain to their constituents what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of developments in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the United States will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that there are three years left for the presidential elections and so there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it should take, mentioned former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after cutting off nearly $17 billion (almost $300 billion CZK) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at once, with a tax of about 50 percent, bank bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he was among the winners also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a successful woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for the research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee received the diploma, Nobel medal and the certificate of money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several prizes in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the one of Peace, received him this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy that he had been awarded, as he was at the beginning of his career and was also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is setting up his stay in the government, as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the appointment, President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left proposals for transfers of funds and increased the money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left side and the government, Klaus and the right side, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the State Budget Act; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long been ignoring "the serious problem", that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus between political parties, could improve this situation, says the president.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is frightening and that the government should think of its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by American actor winning an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Almighty Evan. But rarely did he represent someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong to outsiders worldwide.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as much as possible to reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I held her hand, I received her energy, it was transmitted and she had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon played the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember calling at the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor on Resolved Norway: Russians Tested a Missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded by acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight there were new technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably crashed into the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the launch from a ship that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The same Norwegians from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
This time the generals defend themselves by claiming that we cannot just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the damage occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were destroyed immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the releases were completely error-free, only six of the thirteen failed, according to the Ministry of Defence's management.
The success of nearly fifty percent of the generals full of optimism, and that is why they continue to state that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at 51 years of age.
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-present himself at 51 years of age at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his career at the age of forty in 1998 and is currently chairing the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, cited the AP agency Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won in the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes at the NHL: playing with Detroit won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Chamber of the Glory of Hockey.
Hyundai has met union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change how to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, that is to say, prolong Christmas parties one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the automobile factory were forced to work two hours more than eight hours in shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of trade unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they pledge to meet the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went into strike because of the frequent additional work.
They also protested against bad terms of payment and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
The unionists in their statement of the Monday strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As regards additional work, trade unions require that the company reduce it to a minimum.
Moreover, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in HIV virus 'challenges'
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines already accessible.
AIDS can't be cured until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly prolonged due to a mixture of medicines that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
Substances called metalocarbons have an effect on the albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, 'improved' compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and no mature and infectious bodies of the virus will be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this set of HIV protease substances was carried out in test, as well as against its resistant variants obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalcarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, makes metalcarbons interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ★ezáčová, the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for the coming year is "scaring" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should think about its future existence.
ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say we leave time for analysis.
The vice president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the left-wing parliament.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however, with the amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for state officials' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticised the ODS proposals, since the budget deficit is rising sharply.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassert the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the approval of the amending proposals, the situation might have been different.
According to Česka TV Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with those nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly, if he resigns, whether the chamber adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as subsidies in sickness, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not to blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant positions there were people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to reassign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public estate, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the left majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to rely on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about it, when it is time, I will deal with it, told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS gave in to the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget if the Prime Minister did not explicitly request ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, we responded to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the leader of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the term of office, he knew that in the following months it was primarily about the bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, less trains will circulate by nearly the same rates
Česke dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most tariffs including the basic and customer price will not change.
More opportunities for links to the capital will win, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrovsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will no longer circulate to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - Česke Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Kralové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Česke Budějovice trail and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - Česke Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15 line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem in Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague station Hlavní nadraží.
ČD will introduce more SC links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13 the travelers will not travel back to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive the coming year four billion krona in total, just like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the coming year will pay eight billion krona in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and local drahy they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year old.
Drahy is happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will take place only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 krona for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armies continue to hold more than 50 persons, children were released
The armed people have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 armed men use hostages as a live shield on the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in Majindanao province, it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampathuan, patriarch of an influential Ampathan dynasty.
On Mindanao Island Muslim separatists also operate.
However, they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title esInvictus: Neporažený), which captures part of the biography of the former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela, will be released in American cinemas.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was interpreted by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolikhlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, alongside Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world football championship are being completed in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "little interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared me well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to, as he says, charge his energy, mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won the world cup at that time.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
You'll still see if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lunsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesman for the firemen in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firemen wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokesman, the damage did not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of the Čeps activity nothing similar happened, the damage of this type is sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the company ČEZ for the North Czech Republic, supplies of electricity were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps pęsobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It preserves in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančura will file a slander complaint to three ČSSD Americans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will present a complaint for slander to three Social Democratic Hemans.
This is Michal Hašek from Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and Olomoucký kraj heman Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes on Radiožurnal.
Demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with Česke Drahy.
All three Americans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking pastel passes", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, that we are more expensive than Česke dráhy, which is not true. Let us know the prices of Česke dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It is for slander towards the Student Agency, he said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having evidence from all regions, and he said they had not taken the necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Germans who do so too.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the New Year.
He said, that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with Česke Drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion crowns did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnal.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine starting in January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already views that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococces culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about this in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born from 2 August last year can receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of child age.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily let their children vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 krona and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand krona annually.
No clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for children who are not vaccinated.
So far, the state has spent around 500,000 per year on all child vaccination.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of medium otitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Infections in our country die every year according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the coverage of the children's pneumatic vaccine was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association has been spreading the vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path that we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcus.
At this point we don't think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lekařň Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they can be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as a voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a major change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "get the money out of health insurance".
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable amount.
It won't be easy, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police state that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was trapped while carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of such characters as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The News Agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute might have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, aged 52, told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said that Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and cuts in expenditure in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show its seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security expenditure and a 1% increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
The unions have regretted that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and have warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about £3 billion per year, has angered the business community, which states that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the prior report to the budget
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will be contracted more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
1 point increase in company tax for small firms was discarded
Tax reliefs for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who wins £40,000 will lose £90, while a person who wins £10,000 per year will gain £110.
Ministers said that their objective of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax increases and cuts in expenditure outlined were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again toward the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In its statement, it stated that the economy would probably be contracted by 4.75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5% predicted in April, while the loan application would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Lost opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of loan applications for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, avoiding "cinically" difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They have had the opportunity to do it and have wasted it."
"All the important announcements will be made after the election, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek to further reduce the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's expenses, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies in April mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being given the most needed and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False assumption"
Although the ministers did not publish spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the Ministry of Finance's figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All the important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This was the fake pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
The FBI is investigating American arrests in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five US men suspected of extremist connections.
The US Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the charges they have been arrested for and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported Reuters news agency; but said that the United States had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equal, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, their head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some demonstrators arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, while others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container together with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the government's position and response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski trail was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol point of interest into a racetrack.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You can see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event of Thursday afternoon, the snow will be melted.
They and we are still
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and where there is a widespread warning of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why French don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million French Muslims what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a municipality (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently worldly issues, he maintains, things of everyday life, those that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, professors and intellectuals, none of them of fame, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims probably have a more unjust treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than growing pragmatism, it perceives "an adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, leading the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the politics of whaling, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who gave valuable evidence facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only at the end of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The children, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are generally still one millionth of the area of the area of a wild adult. The climate is hardly ever adequate: a polar bear residing in Singapore has become green by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowskirt Indians use high-power assault rifles to overthrow their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alumn Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of lack of effort.
The pioneer travels of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues to the movement of the ice masses for the first time.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords circulating under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the flute system within the Arctic ice, made up of saltwater jets that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to occur at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
Within a few months, from where we are boarding, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the veterans' graves in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year stopping in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he traveled to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Surrounded by layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the broad meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam war, because they did not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took hold of their hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Around there, Section 60, where most veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadowy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names in the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Sgto Navy artillery grave. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"A long time after my death, I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a contractor from the U.S. government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, state officials from the State Department said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works in projects for customers such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All activities called counterrevolutionary, which include slight protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient community blogger, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested on several occasions permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been looking for a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new products and codified in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in prison in Cuba are among the crime chains such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly dismissed.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as free mobile distribution, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro itself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's site as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials challenge a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, expressing their hope that the case could help detach an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah directed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of al Qaeda that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that the men did not immutation and were even trying to obtain adequate approval for access to the camps of al Qaeda, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, stresses the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has given priority to trying to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war pass, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda was particularly careful with regard to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their advertising value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model than many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched down the streets demanding the negotiators who work at the Bella Center Convention Center of the city, most daring actions for the climate.
The demonstrators said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that stated, "The Earth says "it's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's trips, the country of her mother's birth, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great manifestation, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he made.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to escape it for longer.
The police prevented demonstrators from getting too close to Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were through the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as His Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was really not aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each to define whether the march was harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's federal notebook on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the rating book showed that fourth and eighth-degree students were making their way at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Education Progress Assessment is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of the fourth grade white students in D.C. over the last two years increased from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Throughout a six-year extension, the picture is not more encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of fourth degree in 2003, when the first ENPE was announced in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to only 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by meeting those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating for educational equity in the District.
I am not jumping for joy because of a difference of two or three points, said the member of the Council of D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an asiduous critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what worries is that we are not devoting the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new Reading Curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the higher grades of primary and middle school, who did not dominate the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Every day mathematics, a curriculum of mathematics from Kindergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under former overseer Clifford Janey, who was credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to continue to work to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the ENPE results highlight whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of squabious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies scores of urban tests.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the target can generate political impacts that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now an overseer of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, who considers it an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and blinked for a moment in front of white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where registration costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, whom she would like to study medicine, when the guide announced they had entered the science building.
Caray, really?, he thoughtfully said, when the guide talked about the low proportion of school teachers-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduated from college, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, say the researchers, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her reach university, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to consider providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as the GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil achieves agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies have moved away by having climbed into only two of the 10 substantiated deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for substantiated deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military retreats, probably prevented US oil companies from risking themselves more vigorously in Iraq, which has the third most important reserve of crude oil in the world, said analysts.
American companies were at a disadvantage in some cases because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreement with the ministry.
The major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesperson for the Assam Jihad Petroleum Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be matched by its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
The main planner for Al Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistani border with Afghanistan has killed a leading Qaeda operations planner this week, said US counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner for Qaeda, who led the terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the top command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had climbed rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of unmanned aircraft attacks led by the CIA has decreased since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to an account by The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, said the site.
The UN's maximum envoy in Kabul is about to resign
The highest United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was adversely affected by widespread corruption charges in the UN-backed Afghanistan presidential election.
Eide's departure happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase, but he was concerned that the US military withdrawal schedule that began in 18 months would encourage other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials working with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the burdensome UN recruitment regulations undermined his ability to capture talents.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for his failure to engage in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 US troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war zone trip in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we've learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He said it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and making time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have turned away from the attempted agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engagement with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set as a deadline on December 31st for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devasive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran ' s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday 'unfounded and baseless accusations' by some members of the Security Council on Iran ' s nuclear activities, and said it had the will to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aged population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said 31-year-old Wang, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously decent children, single ill-fated children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to the six when the policy became effective, according to the Division
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31 per cent by 2050, which is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai's Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A Progressive Relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-woman ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the single child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 many of their hard-line mottos were mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night, the posters that ordered families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointment Response
Although officials from a rural city outside Shanghai maintain that they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban districts indicate no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 will reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child their best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, aged 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, aged 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they say, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the policy of the single child as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants a unique child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to having everyone take care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more strongly.
For parents with two races, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about having enough success to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years old grew up seeing their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child requires a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic has to "have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminalizations, has attracted renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not speak of how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN top climate officer Yvo de Boer described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the assertions requesting mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration was adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials did only two years ago.
The United States will not agree without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei had stated that the U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to contain the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, supported Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that talks would produce a political agreement at the utmost.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, drew up a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most exceptional issues must be resolved before the heads of government come to an end.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed to the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to be able to delineate claims that will be agreed next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center every day, the activists playing the guitar show at night mocking the countries they think are selling, and putting forward preliminary proposals by hand rather than by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 km from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train departure that marks a revolution for trips to Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 kmh, when it passes like a lightning beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would shorten and the change of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as would road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still stop Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times said.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next phase planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It looks like this will be the most beneficial option," said one railway member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 mt long trains capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means you'd need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers an hour.
Considering the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be extended to fit the high-speed network.
Train industry experts argue that only St Pancras International station or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work starts, the network should be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on existing roads north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesperson of the Conservative Party, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "of rations", increased his mortgage at £75.000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Close houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Honorary Office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "anaranjal".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent inquiry by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons into its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him from violating the rules, after investigating his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £27,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a Member.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the whole increase would finance the 75,000-pound loan.
The standard variable mortgage type of BRE fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March this year, the type that is now found.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive "on rations" after the expense scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former oil trade profession, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the form of the sterling pound symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he applied for 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not about escaping and delinquenting or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be clearer or simpler in any way."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Palace of Brighton Beach
Brighton's palates have found a new boost for winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palates every December, using villains as their theme.
The event started on December 1, with guests who could see the last palate from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed pastries and ponche served free of charge.
The chosen villains so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect people as Church to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Dadpa's Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in complaint of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the Danish icy capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with dolphins and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to the police, they were especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinctions", stressing that one hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took it to the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-watch.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from the large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial plumbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" by "justice and climate".
Today we took the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said Beninian singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, watercourses that you can walk through as never before could be done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Pacific Asia region, which brings together many islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, gave the initial highlight to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and polishing handkerchiefs with sun energy slogans.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations were formed of hundreds of demonstrators who claimed to act strongly against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
These elections are a sham.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, "wails that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempted to prove through this election that it was ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes along the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district head Beslan Archba warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the poll.
At a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow's support, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, responded by raising his vodka vessel.
The opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the abjasted railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be arranged two weeks later.
Climate: manifestations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, seeking an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The very peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took it to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without attempting to enter.
A stage was set to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-watch.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a dock, and four cars were burned near a occupied house during the incidents that led to arrest some twenty people, according to the police.
The extremist groups did not take their eyes off them, I warn police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present like some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial plumbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" by "justice and climate".
Today we took the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who had to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific Asia region, which brings together many islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, gave the initial highlight to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs in favour of solar energy in front of the Philippine Capital City Council.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators were formed claiming to act against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "enriched" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor's degree will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "sufficient with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "C branch is no longer a scientific branch," but "generally, it summons the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be the uppermost of the C, it goes on to stress even: "I have not heard that historians or intellectuals were outraged for having eliminated history and geography in second degree of baccalaureate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory teaching of history-geography in second bachelor's degree C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second bachelor's program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they felt sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give proof of admission, which will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, a proof of admission on their teaching ability, explained the Minister.
They will also practice in real conditions during the year of M2, and then will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the competition, you will already have great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
At the High Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a convincing way the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that took place on Saturday morning, Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference round "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute presentations of experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and convey them a desire to know more, explained at the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Retaliation in payments: Disturbation among prison guards is expected to take action
The prison guard unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the end-of-year parties, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers Force (2nd guard union) asked staff outside service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve mass mobilization", as it is called "disgraceful and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls on general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellorship reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions ensuring that payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I request the Directorate of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures designed to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for management staff who benefit from the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements," deplored Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional union FO de Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if the October days are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threats FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As our tasks and missions increase without taking more force, it is more than regrettable to dare attack the staff salary, according to the Burdeos Prison CGT.
According to trade unions, not all regions do the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the year-end parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be the departure.
Pope Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the statements of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I gave you nice gifts," he said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering in humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw him, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the President.
Just many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, but I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its neighbours, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified "damage from the operation" of discal hernia performed in Paris on November 26, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind by saying that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last singer's tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park international clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
On Monday, singer Johnny Hollyday joined the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but assured that there was no "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to get twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the producer of the musician, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure him by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "he was responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated on by a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been exaggerated. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, their allies even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet at your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the Worlds-2009 long swimming pool, obtained on Thursday an international title in a distance where he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
In the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three records of the world were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A punishment for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that owns a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during an end where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first internationally.
Bousquet moved ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world brand (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my grasp, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers dressed in polyurethane bathers from 1 January will be banned.
These bathers, originating in 238 world records since February 2008, end their epopey in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion on a long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his brand by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday in $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "that represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is an unusual piece, since in the world there are only four or five," explained AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most uploaded by buyers, without a doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the author's death of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborted the Departure from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa declared.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday to El Salvador to take itself to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General for Migration.
In order to grant him a safe lead, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and request political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as Head of State in guest exercise.
The coup government "has suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," said Zelaya on Thursday to radio Globo, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has taken five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the deposit president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico submitted us a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing asylum, declared on Wednesday the Minister of Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview on the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the retired president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Embassy of Brazil.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must respond to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of its term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the US trade balance figures testify to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1.102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotic, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October in relation to September, at $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of the volumes of trade, in particular the exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they market with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the Economy.com research company.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "has been the lowest since a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The return of the 10-year Treasury Bond amounted to 3.482 per cent compared to 3.423 per cent on Tuesday night, and the return to 30 years to 4.492 per cent compared to 4.408 per cent on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power abuse the "Damas de Blanco" · Global Voices
This Thursday, hundreds of Cuban government supporters attacked the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, supported an AFP journalist.
Americans die!, "Mercenary!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Liva Fidel and Raúl!" were crowned with a high fist by power militants to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to "protect them."
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Damas de Blanco" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habano district of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also about to protest on Thursday for the international day of human rights, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to dissidents who were targeted by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Macedonia is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities call on opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" to pay for their declared enemy, the United States.
Fact in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration on Thursday of government militants against "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An outlaw kills an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Seine) on Thursday at the most frequent hour of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, to an old man, in the pharmacy or in front of him in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès boulevard, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance Police Union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, broke in and got hurt.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elderly died.
The life of the other injured, with the seemingly affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have hurt two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and another forty severely.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed his back, explained instead a head of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transients, including young people, tried to control the outlaw, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw him over, among them a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
By the boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured in punches, according to the police's testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important injury in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person came about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police personnel arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office has investigated the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Upper Seine (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his interim detention, he did not speak.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all disturbed of this type whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), which dismisses the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", denounced before three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at the same time, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "has proved to be chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (lost since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before sentencing, which constitutes a serious procedural fault.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the prosecutor's own mouth, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the documentary author.
Hummel called for a trial to be held that would allow him to submit the evidence of his argument if the court rejected the rejection of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument made at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of charges could be seriously assessed as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "unlawful sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles district deputy prosecutor Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to present himself at the hearing."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a chance to flee?, Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "calls for a favor to the court, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She maintains that her client no longer supports her being harassed every time the Polanski case rescinds, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and stops by the dollar raise
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend remained due to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's view of the robustness of economic reactivation," summarized analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3 per second consecutive month and higher than expected in November.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were hampered by a further advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months compared to the euro, which " leads down to the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The return of the 10-year Treasury Bond amounted to 3,540 per cent compared to 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent on the eve.
The election of Miss Mundo again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss Mundo are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Ka rgbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I've seen so many things and I've experienced countless experiences!," said Miss Sierra Leone.
This event, held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, to the north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have been able to live twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that remove the breath".
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, Miss Mundo candidates focus on the competition.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with bathrobe.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss Mundo event.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous Township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who held their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Football World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I treated people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back to the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13h local (21h GMT).
The singer's son, disbanded, assured that he would be transferred "how long before" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday because of an infection resulting from the disc hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a discal hernia operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be next to the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated with the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic at Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus declared.
He talked about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before at the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a haematoma formed after a brain hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, an attorney for the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" accused "with regularity" before the Order Council, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "has been carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "couldn't cause haemorrhage and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Centre on the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, intimating him to withdraw it from any support, on the penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he considered that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having stretched his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) has been assisted by the Deputy Hervé de Charette who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and to the deputy inciting them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under the penalty of judicial demand.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'ajourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the site presentation page, they support the signatures of the letter.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which requires that the NC immediately remove the name of the UDF from all support, as well as (your) website.
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) mark to legitimate rights".
Failure to do so will call on justice to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, warns the signatories.
In the letter, they need that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not, according to them, have any right to use the UDF acronym.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to perform it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as stated by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to expoliate her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fines.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga over one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to these examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday will be required to deliver a report by 10 March 2010 in which they will report whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from a state of weakness and during which periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said on leaving the audience.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt, for his part, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' allegations sometimes resulted in a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters his client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardian's judge had refused, in recent days, to issue his request to open a judicial custody procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to appear before the justice, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No other person may appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgement on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once the trial had been held.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a matter for employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as it was to impose products on consumers thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives particularly.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "required that all parties involved (...) should have proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; the BI (Business Intelligence) required an undertaking that was totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the collaborators at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative utility
Will internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old conductive theory that the American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind them.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanical management, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into all reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the motivational analysis adopt this conception of employees' motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a default doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Speech by Oslo: by the "Just War" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, exclaimed Obama's speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s award on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, who was a former vice-president during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, declared Mrs Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former president of the House of Representatives was delighted, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historical to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former elected representative, some of whom consider a possible candidate for Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current columnist at the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizens of the world", as a "always does," he "spoke as an American president" reminding the Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monoton, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the left-centre press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," said the California newspaper.
Obama "spoke the speech that was needed," said the New York Times, judging him "at the same time as both gloomy and upbuilding."
Road transport: three Marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three Marathon negotiations, the road unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat of Christmas supply.
During the signature session on Friday night, the Secretary of State of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last morning hour.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) withdrew giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours beginning at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very damaging to businesses" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the weekend parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for higher wages (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from EUR 8.72 to 9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there can always be some dissenting rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and which respects the employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010 which will enable, above all, to address the issue of extraordinary payment and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a EUR 100 million decrease in employer charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the Bill of Correction Finance for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to companies which are members of this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the utmost urgency," said Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "ingenuous business", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Unostra was regretted.
For the OTR, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions inconsistent with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday only trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to one train every two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Galleries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "RATP strives to provide service to large shops".
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains circulated in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
Thus, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive at time".
The Saint-Lazare Station was not saturated, the SNCF indicated that it had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement forces.
The RER A that operates SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with management on Friday afternoon.
The RR Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all respects for RRR A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium they owe, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even puts its premium proposals in brackets, commented outraged by the CGT, pointing out that the management "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," RATP said.
What also led the unions to say that the company "does not care about the users of the weekend."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
So the management, who had refused until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents submitted a notice.
Trade unions claim a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the Prokurd Party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main prosecutor's party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that were detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the press President of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, said Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including his President Ahmet Türk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, were removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party ' s property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Their leaders warned prior to the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before being MPs without a party label.
The decision stems from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party asserts that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at the time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds will stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast Anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large town of the Southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The Order Forces dropped tear grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators launched Molotov bombs or sunken stones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen disappointment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, declared to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle we oppose the closure of parties.
Thus nothing can be resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK won an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfalls can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Braubburger wants.
It is at all something that makes life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in the winter of the EDF
But with this your employees can learn how to test and master all vehicle technology.
The weekend may be announced by meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections with large salt vehicles, explains Brauburger.
For example, major arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the accesses for the body of firemen, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and tracks with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF service starts around three a.m.
It should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the EDF starts about three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours starts."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of maintenance of roads in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where trouble is generated, Braubburger knows well.
Around 5:00 a.m., the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous and cruising points are discharged.
The EDF could not generally handle all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braubburger.
As these become quick swings, the salt vehicle will start as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa foundae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1,50 meters high that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an extended head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with hooves and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues at the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relations, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for the sediments of the Triassic, reports Randall Irmis member of the team of the Utah Natural History Museum.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were assembled in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Many Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided into its three most important genealogical lineages: carnivorous teropods among those found in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Herbivorous Ornithischia (sauri with bird pelvis), which belong to, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa findsae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also owned by the offspring of the teropods, birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa findae also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the teropod with older and primitive air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the parent line of the later giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, researchers conclude that the sauries emerged there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages were separated at first and extended from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earthly mass, the Supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the remains of two other not very closely related teropods.
All three cannot descend from a single parent predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science Study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments Bonn Martin Sander's paleontologist.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils continue to be preserved, while on other continents there is little to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to Mesozoic's dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosauries and many other sauri.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship faded within the boundary of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Success stories weren't eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
A massive extinction could have been given to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slows down the rise of a group of species, which had already evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has impacted all over the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, took out last week the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
Young people in the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also united with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the director of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the principal of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented in a broadcast by Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The view of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying in depth the arguments and demands of students, they are dismissed.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenograd representatives have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the Chief Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot on the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the home of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sytronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for the investigation of armaments.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart Brakes
The size of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough for anything.
For the project's supporters it is simply and plainly treated as "the new heart of Europe".
The law only. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered fossils of engineering in the 19th century, which acted as brakes on a modern rail traffic, as a huge amount of time was needed in ancient times to hook the locomotives from behind forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must be done.
And that's why the terminals were supposed to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about half the route of the trans-European operation lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course do not have any more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new frame built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have so arranged.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the computer graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time the competition for low-cost flights was not given.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crosses and narrow passages on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 we have built the trail slowly.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport sentence.
The federal government remains pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it is going to file an appeal appeal to the decision on the prohibition of night flights of the Hesbaden Administrative Court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the legal judgement of the VGH, over 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the northwest runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federated state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether it will file an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which had been made before the elections; otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one lets his word come true, said the head of Green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We have fulfilled our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federal government would be trying by distorting the law and tricking yet to obtain their night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first rapid impression".
We need a legally unattainable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represented it, it would never have been the group's statements about the ban on night air traffic.
The U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The large U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned only once the aid it had been granted to the bank rescue fund Tarp of a total of EUR 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the US CNBC.
In this way, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had come out of hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also seeks to obtain money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce for Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF administrative council (German television channel) presses the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote about the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the not further damage to the director of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Bender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but one failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the administrative council weeks before the election had indicated that they were not going to support Bender in his position.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the government president of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the ZDF informants would have lost audience indexes.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which it flagged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 experts in public law had even been involved in the debate, which described Koch as unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Roman philology.
He later worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning programme "Morgensagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's removal, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Media Magazine".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Rhine-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the management's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of policy supporters from the ZDF control boards was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with a smart move: he strongly criticized the Brender removal process.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence as much as Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative board could vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a support suitor.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the liberals on the left.
University careers are taking off
Partial success for students: after one year of educational-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the case of undergraduate and master studies.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each career module must complete with a single examination.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states undertake to make structural rules more flexiblely together for Bachelor's and Master's careers.
Rules of the federated states that differ from this must no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the university directors have been continually talking about the improvement of being able to complete and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single examination", says in a 30-page document, which intends to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, so explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, "stubitability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of..
courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and foster their own initiative."
These rules would be valid for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reaccredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take up to 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which are installed by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of materials and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Rhineland-Plantida has provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring and student counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, only one examination should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of the next year it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studyability".
On Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federated state.
Apart from the compliments, there were also criticisms of decisions.
At the federal board of university groups Juso (young socialists) demanded that the education policy configuration should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" by ministers and university directors.
No later than after the educational strikes, students as principals should be able to express their views as well.
The president of the Board of University Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need the students' experience," said the Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a later Master's career.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions in the future. So reported a GEW member, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically without control," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in disequilibrating language fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who earned his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book editorial, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the literature forum in Hesse at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said that he spoke quite well last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his files of Security"
Visible insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement admitting participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security against fellow German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totook, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Along with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German language award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"So I'm someone who didn't defend himself sufficiently in the face of security's provocation attempts," Söllner said.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller and her unmatched literary controversy with the dictatorial domination mechanisms, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far known, not only author, but also victim.
In his file for Security IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of Julio in the weekly "Zeit", after having read his own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and Walter as well.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the deal with the files of the security control is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Security (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority of the Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is given rather to trails.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former Head of the Security of Temesvar spoke defiantly of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," at the end she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there is silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by anxieties of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, boarded a Mercedes Class C taxi a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed external service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the manufacturer of sports items would have distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a chauffeur because he had not yet met the city.
Moreover, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, nor was the 55-year-old man drunk of joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighth of the end", namely, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Luck
The 8th final of the Champions League (departments from 16/17 and 23/24 February/retour 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of Babbel's successor remained limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the puzzled professions of Stuttgart self-confidence, readiness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things have not been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wine" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had evidently missed when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns the sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, players and administrators also abstained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defence due to the lack of relief and totally overrun of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, thought Khedira.
And director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate at his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been awarded by the carrier Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
It had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change coach because of the pressure of the teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games would have been eliminated Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the past.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two forts.
But at least they agreed with all the others in which, without the previous efforts with the replacement coach's team, the show of great force of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and also agreed the plastic suitcase man.
World heavyweight championship fight
Hot duel in Bern: Over and over again Retractor Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title in the WBC version.
The judge's trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion of heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday night in Bern for American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to realize the nocturnal that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
Retractor Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his number 24 fight.
In front of some 17000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, he wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven inches lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodged again and again from the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively carry his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a retractor, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retractor had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
As he weighed, the champion was tempted on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he won the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had recovered his "WBC" belt, which had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year later he won in his defenses of the title Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after the belt destroyed Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall in November.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, for false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and leftists require explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for knowingly misleading the cause.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the TV channel ARD, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "did not know the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged on Saturday the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder was part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellorship, the Army and the Information Service had approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected criticism.
The chancellor did not exert any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, they had been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it was clear that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with respect to the complaints made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Onirical worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts do the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender without hindrance to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleeplike states during the watch, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drug addicts.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality be blurred.
Onirically modified alert states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been derailed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenia psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since the ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproposals, allocated formations, and mirroring of it".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of devils with wings, with red flies like blood, deformed, grinding teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Shy and malignant voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from the stereo, binds them to form a hanging knot, and fastens them to a hook on the roof.
He climbs into a bowl and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
Let it be a lesson to you!, shout out the voices in a choir that the bellies give him back, "Go to the clinic and make them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also manic-depressive, taking medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's been learning how to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and they fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially extended is hearing voices: voices giving commands, commenting or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time it comes into a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as such."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an incognito why our brain makes goats.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency may lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinant factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an incognito how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself for many years at all.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there already exists a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor in psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
The perception of hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms associated with psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as personality limitation disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually suppressed.
They arise when areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or uncohibited; when our brain is warmed, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, pain of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Study gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an undestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a high school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair leads the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
He's awake and he sees and hears that boy, just as he sees and hears the girl sitting on the bank next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the other visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class sometimes you cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, you can't tell if you're awake or dreaming, whether the images you see, the mice or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told them anything, they'd think she's crazy.
August 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
He approved last year selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you've come into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while he begins to hallucinate.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it's responsible for looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was scared of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he uses reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," Kasten says, "has a place in the brain, reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that her patients appreciate her hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences are usually pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful disease but also involves something positive and creative – madness is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differ from being awake.
The dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneneuropathy who experience motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei vollem Bewustsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a real situation that is very dangerous to a self-imaginary world that is disappointed from reality.
A form of limited situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inexhaustible situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen dived into a world created by it and visited strange places of other times: he was placed on the bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow finn and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
The children will take care of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda confirmed, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put before 7,500 workers their children, if they are not sufficiently qualified to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, from 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasury and thus came responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took care of direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the cover of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Her son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are not safe from the decline: "This has always affected families who become infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great delusions," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Entire beauty
Everything that - in matters of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within reach of your hand.
This seems to have been proposed The English Court, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which handles laser hairdressing -; Spagion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while watching the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to assemble your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibrational platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, brightness or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Miscellaneous Scouts
Christmas is approaching and it is never again to review the looks of the stars to fit them to our party outfit.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Hall of Barcelona, have created the 'Live Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVEL Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and is active in a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The president of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main exporting sector.
In the submission of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has undertaken during the period to support the car sector.
"Without the Automation Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an abandonment scenario, closing some of our main production plants," said the president of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automation Plan (IAP), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized governmental measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, applied in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "40%" in November.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can classic motorcycles and cars be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine will be found.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic motor that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Classic Cochera, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests abroad
In addition, the trade activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit equipped outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sport is not driven by respect for the environment.
For this reason, Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start-up system - named i-Stop-, a device that is only available with the petrol 2.0 engine with 150 horses for the time being.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
Finishes, finishing the vehicle, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the driving station, we found that the front armchairs present excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following with the set formed by the tool frame and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough housing for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all of this is added a large trunk with regular forms.
The engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with the manual change of six gears.
This engine is a real delight. It excels by its fineness, its reduced noise, its performance and its achievement of content consumption.
And it is true that although the most demanding Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometres a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both because of its high running comfort, and because of its content consumption.
With regard to the equipment level, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one incorporating a greater number of serial elements.
From the series equipment, especially the rail change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as little as its equipment was, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bexenon adaptive headlamps and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It highlights especially the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not make many kilometres a year can opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the petrol 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxurious finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'First'
L. A. covers the red carpet sensuality of Penelope Cruz's hand, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever been wrapped up in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid for, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has taken out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in exchange for paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as your US counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up the data when you cross the border or desperately seek a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) in order to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated ear tyrons to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device such as FonPeek (it is still curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no cats.
It is a connected device and is paid for by buying it, not monthly.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime-access buying option like Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If Barack Obama has already come to take possession of him as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: besides being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the vestarium.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of a fat fit, in Oslo it is a threefold stamped.
The supplements have also varied: green shoes half heel again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one gathered on this occasion, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey conducted between 9,737 15-75-year-old women leaves no doubt about it: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen job opportunities limited due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have an unstable job, first begin cohabitation as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have less descent.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after commencing living, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs has required more time from their life path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of their children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a great influence on maternity although less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first vastago.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they marry and at which they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1-32.1 on average, respectively.
"An additional division is established among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, middle or upper-level ones reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, playing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous L'Oréal Paris records, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such a selected club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their prizes, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have been through their literary life (and, in cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographic likeness, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of the creative character's ignition.
The trip has its excitement and Vicent does not save any fears or enlightenments.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and readings.
I'll give you a few shots here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same that I felt without name: the pleasure against the fate of the sorcery, the guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic mood, without sense, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must climb the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are exposed again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said he was the heir to an landowner in the county and others who was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry launched from a bridge by that character from Munich to bring his echo to the end of the night of the 20th century in its literary form and made it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he got on his knees and prayed: 'God, dear, please stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life of the weary pleased death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband usually accepted that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went before his madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Saintos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Heaven do but abdicate that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by with her and our dog, a specimen of mestizo race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, proposed two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is capital because we found no fun in a free aggression to a small and helpless animal, which by the way was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when ingrained these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, because an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old person or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday any by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we made a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt it would be useful for much and not generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignity has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal free of charge that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, especially among younger drivers, today reported both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "is going beyond designing and manufacturing products more and more secure every day" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increases the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the employer figures of the manufacturers Anfaf and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not obstant, should be placed in quarantine since the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the last month's score, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the light commercial tailor drawer: derived from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chasis.
Also, the nubarrons that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, other factors such as the rise in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation need to be added to the restrictions of the closed bank credit register.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has hardly been used.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to buy a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year ending, which calculates a drop in sales (tourism and 4x4) by 19%.
Emergency brake aid is already mandatory
As happened with ABS brake anti-lock and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, this is already the case in all new commercial tourism and vehicles, while for the rest there is a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while, in its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the pedestrian the driver gives.
But this doesn't always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, the third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses when stopping.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one out of every four claims will be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects the obstacles and alerts the driver, as well as act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device shall exert the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly wants, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has previously been agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, since GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports contact with some new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but it takes force from the Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
Flying the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as base and managed to thinn nothing less than 80 kilos, which left the scale in just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by a hand-operated canvas, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 extra pounds; mounting sports baccettes 12 more and with light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door shooters by some of the screen, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the dual clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with really reversed traces
Its behavior can only be described as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, on the contrary: it had been a long time since we tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmitted so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat your muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until we order you to spring, brake, recover and reexpress your motor...
What we ask of you. Thanks to your address, as communicative as necessary, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's fog, already debuted previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from the stop or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we crossed with Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car digested the bags well.
Electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the funniest driving that one can in the market and that is more than just a change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of Coco Cocoon and 'starette' occasionally of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodiges her blouse face with as much consummation as her Chanel pockets.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl' is a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia Gives a Victory in Israel
The Working Box achieved a brilliant victory for 82-91 in its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and thus is placed in the leadership of his group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 valuation).
The Victorian team was able to cope with the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer to the end in order to achieve victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triple notes had much to do with the final triumph.
The game began face-to-face for the blugrans, which were placed from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already prescribing that they had jumped to the Israeli court with their hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more than the same, but the team welcomed Barac's inner game and the work of Eliahu, which was received with pliers and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less than six' rating already showed that it was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being engaged in the break, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victors that in their court no one wins, and with 'Elijah''s hand pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turning of the 'yellows' to the bright (50-49).
More drawbacks
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not less dead, needed to thread a couple of hits to catch air, and in those arrived Mirza Teletovic machine gun, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The seaweeds left the skin in the last part and English and San Emetrio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not sign up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the one from fighting
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece to the Olympics and gave him the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a game marked by the casualties of the cashiers, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaysian team was not frightened by the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion, nor by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed to dream of the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of the base Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, collapsed the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympics was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the premises in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, they turned the marker 22-20 minute 13, when an action, a fighting tale, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to work by showing its superiority within both areas, where the loss by injury of the English pawn Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were barking the cashiers.
Between the players inside and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible remount
The third period was very offensive with the Olympics, which despite the 19 losses was superior and even matched the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which caused the group's leadership to tangle.
Unicaja was trying to overlap with the absences and the last down of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the Uniqueja for Cook's leadership and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pawn Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, delivering the leader to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the searcher with more classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates users' salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application is running, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera in a statement.
According to data available to Trovit from its searchers in the United Kingdom and France, Spanish people are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 who receive a Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annual in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 net annual euros; followed by dependent work, with 14,725 euros; and worker work, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are that of drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date at the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President shall leave the diplomatic law by 27 January 2010 at the latest when he or she has officially completed his or her term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when he has completed his mandate, he has to search for another destination."
The station also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the status of political asylum that the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving cash-free bar to types close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they begin to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far away from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt was again affected.
Again there is a quality flight and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries vis-à-vis Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision below the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral-risk defenders who were once again trying to create awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen it before.
A government that conceals public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out of the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro-member country to break its commitments.
What does make sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in wide positions, it would be within what was expected.
In the Spanish case, as our public debt differentials widen just as European corporate bonds do not have to worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continues to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario up by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not give much hope of life to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".

Iberdola's president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushes of what he had raised in the closed subcommittee.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million by 2020 and another €60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the coming decade investment should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but at distribution networks and international interconnections
As of 2020, the issue has changed and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that has just been approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as the President of Iberdola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should be taken as they are already taking time to mature and a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Air Lingus 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport services on land, Swissport Switzerland, will play the preferred partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most outstanding.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol yesterday to create the Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Activates its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
He works for his first freeway in Australia, a market in which he already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1.7 billion Australian dollars (about €1.047 million).
French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to sit in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
The City Hall wants to keep it ready at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan sponsored by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 million) and in the latter phase competes with three consortia with a significant presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish in liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second one, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Actiona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French Bouygues Construction Group.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton share capital (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local also Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it has a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed Hochtief or Bilbao, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It acts by a geographical area of the utmost importance to the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the disillusionment business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and operation fields of infrastructure.
The underground toll path, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the West Highway of Toowong with the bypass route at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce congestion in the Brisbane traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets out the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per sense, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute US$500 million ($308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give work to German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to start and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The signature gets this contract days after the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator informed her.
The contract reflects the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A lot of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a recurring one.
Application store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 473.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that more money has won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Wining the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from the major clubs.
So much so, the competition has distributed EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that more money has been paid for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the late European Cup in 1992 is the fifth of the rankings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, Michel Platini's organization plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Atletico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million only because they were there, in addition to another EUR 550,000 for each party they fight.
There are also bonuses to win (80,000 euros) and to draw (400,000 for each team).The eight-finalists will receive three million each; the eight-fourth-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is the main ones, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year's champion remains 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa described yesterday the details of the offer of buying shares with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and would be remunerated with an interest for this postponement of 1% per year
Yesterday Sos' shares closed to EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumasa's offer is worth 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 counsellors.
The Jerezano Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to stay away from possible shopping offers and from the judicial vavens of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a new creation post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
With regard to the credit to the Salazars, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday in the National Court that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes Paternine's exclusion opa submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion opa submitted by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation when it understands that its terms are in accordance with the existing rules and considers the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the supply, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for peripping cars
In these days of temporary accidents, they not only win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complicated work.
It calculates the cost of repairing between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including German pieces of work, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a small issue
That's why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for assessing claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then processing and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the US Solara group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxation and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the extent that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies start working.
It is very hard work, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and their price introduced.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "snuck".
If it is a fan model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the moving mobile park, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatax invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month includes 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to use different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinister assessment solution, for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and heavy or light industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company, which performs thousands of experiments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its base number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSbastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to upload through the declared vehicles total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by omodel brands.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to damage or how many severe disasters have occurred in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It trades, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for damage assessment, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually over the last three years, and in 2008 they billed EUR 10.8 million.
Early last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatax was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter €19.1 million, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solara group was worth $1 billion in stock exchange, and now its shares amount to $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of accidental cars
Last October, the Solara group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction was a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended the next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a vast international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, pickups and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose driver's number has been given off cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a replacement.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even though they have been released after some harsh management.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search the replacement, create the budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who tend to be more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with internet connection.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired using its base number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, reloads or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop orientation does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the Audatex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
