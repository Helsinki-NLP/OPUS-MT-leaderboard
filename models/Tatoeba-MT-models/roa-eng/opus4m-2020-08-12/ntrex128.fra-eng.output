Members of the Assembly of Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Welsh electors are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of railing.
A Labour electorate indicated that his group was concerned about the fact that the acronym "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Gales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crutch.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Parti du Pais de Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a change of name, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change of name, stated that “the final decision concerning the appointment of members of the Assembly falls to the latter”.
The Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act 2017) Act 2007 empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership title, the Commission looks to Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
Other suggestions appear to be made by members of the Assembly, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real break for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include further amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of name during the discussions on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on the amendment of the country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a long-standing dispute between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has stressed the fact that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, Saint Martin bells silenced
"The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more today."
According to him, it's normal that the bars have been scratched.
Today, "we don't get used to the same way anymore," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar as well as to his neighbor's, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before the managers imagine and this concerns him: " sooner or later, they will return to the starting box".
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help to maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be the Whites who will precipitate the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members of them," he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation abandoned its premises in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation, which preached nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was resumed by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Black people were looking to get used or promoted.
In 1939, a fire devastated the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the Church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (Michigan University), the professional who played it in July, gave her another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of question about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the Episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wished to impose the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old teen injured by a shark during lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and went to pay for it to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was crying out for joy of having had a hold, and then he understood that in reality he
had been bitten.
On arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he presented an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I cried out that everyone would get out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is not known.
During a press conference, Chief Relief Officer Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities have closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad until Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 shark species, but most are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hand is low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnished with rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field experts.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household items are falling, broader beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets now invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers up to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, increasingly important criteria among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer will test concessions in two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second scheduled opening in the current year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to dig in to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to shop online and to go to nearby shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly resemble large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel sales of common consumer goods and cost-effective acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended with a controversy over the distribution of benefits from pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
It was after having sold its 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for an amount of £125 million in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in it, which consisted of introducing into 4 stores a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the framework for customers.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our institutions, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes shopping habits," said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million agreement
Curroux de la estar du program televisé Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the animator Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million related to his home decoration brand, to dedicate himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the interior decoration mark and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to Gwyneth Paltew's Goop brand.
At the age of 37, this Morning's animator announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones the star of Dragon's Den furious, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to dedicate himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the dear child on television revealed, during a meeting that was under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den Star commercial empire in Marlow (Bukinghamshire), that his new contracts, at a value of 1.5 million pounds sterling, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside of Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and in the process of ensuring its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is full of products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's animator, who is among Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to underwear or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
Moreover, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, had been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, aged 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples were on vacation together and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of the I'm A Celebrity programme of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he didn't want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was loud, but finally we love each other.
Trump ridiculed the media that criticized him for his comment that some people considered "unworthy of a president," and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump yield so much?"
He's doing it by taking a voice as a TV journalist.
"I didn't give in at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had expressed support for the holding of a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders that at the United Nations General Assembly there was no "response" for the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his speech of gathering Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," said the North American President.
We froze the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
Trump said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers rendered to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's hardly more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized him pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that rocked Lombok, aid from foreign NGOs was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been decreed, a condition required for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international help, which makes things a little complicated," said Mrs. Subong.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, she still does not know whether work on the ground will be permitted.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be authorized to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the constant shocks, the country lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugees have been set up in Aceh, but they are scarce in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm sirens have resounded in Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the decommissioned infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable money on restoring roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr. Joko's government, which is called upon to represent itself before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure to persist in inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, in the midst of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool Attacker Daniel Sturridge achieves equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a defeat in Liverpool in the First League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goals, and his team was running from 1 to 0.
He shoots in the ball on his left, before he escapes a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the top right corner of the net.
The bullet ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its road at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to put myself, take a ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to earn as much time," Sturridge confides at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea was leading 1 to 0 in mid-time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues heeled a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before heading into the middle of the field and sprinting side Liverpool.
Kovacic realized a quick and coming in the middle of the field,
Then he made a beautiful deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a shot from the left foot behind the doorman of the Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the group phase of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: the number of tsunami victims is 832
The disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance sheet reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency during a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of having stabbed a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 0755 hours, the 44-year-old woman with knife blows was discovered on Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation just began, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspected of contacting us.
I call particularly on taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know women presented themselves at the crime scene and asked questions about where they were discovered.
The investigation is under way and the police indicated that it informed the parents close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confessed that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
repeating: "It's too horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were placed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone who has information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crime Failure organization at 0800 555 111, as indicated in register 247 of September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His ban would be the fair return of things, in view of acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods in England, committed by his Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal " unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that, "in view of the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was clear that that Oliver Cromwell's one erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that was held for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Goldsmith stated in Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressures, I mean of course monarchy.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: A Pig Kills a Farmer · Global Voices
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southeast China.
Identifyed as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery trenched and covered with blood near a porch on the market in Liupanshu in the province of Guizhou, indicated Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject swine vaccines into a pighouse, on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that a door to the neighbouring porch was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan' death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and allow police to collect evidence.
The farmer's family Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a farmhouse in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg stuck a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this kind of behavior.
"These are rather game animals,
very curious kids... they have no intention of harming.
Just show them the respect they owe them," he says.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the south-east of the United States
In accordance with the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the north-east coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rain in north-east Mexico and south-west the United States over the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was at 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulate eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in storm form, Hurricane Rosa will lead to intense tropical humidity northward in the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with near depression will create generalized torrential rains in the South-West over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden raw hazards, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The showers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the south-west, including a large part of Arizona.
Decisive tropical rains may cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture in the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could convert canyons into chained rivers and storms will produce gusts of wind and dust whirlwinds from place to place.
Approximate depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the California coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the pavement slippery.
This could be the first rain of the dry season in the region.
Tropical rain showers will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall to four corners of Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes leads to a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will experience considerable temperature disparities on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat is trying to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the center and east of the United States is expected to experience a start of hot October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the season average.
The forecasts over several days indicate that temperatures should be above average in the eastern United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television stations on Thursday, the incoming hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theatre coup: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had committed acts on her person and had tried to remove her clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that it had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial is likely to reach an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV in the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose facilitators largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most watched channel during the hearing day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing on Friday.
After the Bureau of the Moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken part by demonstrators while attempting to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of live inquiry.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that it would be more like that at the committee meeting.
All wired and broadcast channels covered the session on-line a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the whole Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, which the minority democrats demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with her friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice was heavy in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses opponents in Brexit of making the "small policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making the "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Great Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "self ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police arrested a fatal shot suspect who caused the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was injured and accused of murder in the second degree, indicated Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office of Baton-Rouge parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the medical and legal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement forces for their "commitment and pursuit of justice".
Sims was only 20.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We are constantly shortening this kind of event," Wade regretted.
Mexico: a volcano cracks ashes
From the ashes escaping the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre monitored several sprinklings and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the approach to the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being rejected by riot police officers, masked separatists threw them eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Heats also broke out later in the day, while police used bricks to contain confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that scandalized "not forgetting, nor forgiving," faced unionist supporters crying "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain alive in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, opponents of secession who largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It had the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We witnessed a great time last year.
My parents cried with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he lamented.
Despite their capital victory, although thin, in the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had a hard time maintaining momentum this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
"The tension only rises," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to submit his candidacy to the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression brought about by the Spanish government," he said.
Arrest in Londonderry : Men get a house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after having sunk several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would have also received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the game 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal assures Livingston's victory
Recently ranked, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games at Steven Gerrard, the current coach at the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place itself in the second ranking position, equally with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which carries 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it has extended its invincible course in the division by 6 games, and its main trainer Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may be proud to have not lost the slightest meeting yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of angry opponents
Holt's team could have taken a long time before marking, because their direct approach made the Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson tried to strike but remained enthralled in front of the opposite goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them by working tactics.
That's where the decisive purpose comes in.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to hit Menga, who took a touch and scored a goal of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time met the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers Allan McGregor arrested Scott Pittman's foot, while Lithgow managed to play one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were rejected by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for one hand failure.
Livingston's " phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and exciting results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have practically not changed since their return to the summit, but the merit largely returns to Holt for having since its motivated arrival a team
which includes many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall inhale throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and managed to hit the opposite side only once; it is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the picture.
Mixed home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 demonstrators from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters approached to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's dual vision: a visitor received as heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10.15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London Police stated that officers were working hard to identify the individual and to prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been established. It is advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in a riot
The prison officer for high-security men stated that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The riot began in HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09h30 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized riot agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, agents were treated for slight facial injuries.
A prison manager spokesperson said: "Specially trained personnel were deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police officers were sent to prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the personnel with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is what will probably happen at the beginning of next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden floods.
The national weather service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix Tuesday, with rains announcing from Monday evening.
The Phoenix-based national weather service stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates at the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per location in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert including the Central Rocky Area and the Grand Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to sudden flood risks.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona has at least one extreme category drought, the second most serious category," saysweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins her journey along the coasts, in the peninsula of Basse-California.
Always with great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and could lead to a flood risk.
"To total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to northwest Sonora and will reach up to 25 cm."weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the Tuesday evening.
" torrential rains are expected in Basse-California, northwestern Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly sudden floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on the charge of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is currently stable.
The police in Avon and Sommerset reported having arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20 years old) in the night on the Radstock side.
Officers have appealed to people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president stated on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on every front for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first vote of decisive procedure in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a Republican Party collaborator at CNN.
Indonesia: One earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to rise
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of which were carried by huge waves that fell on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The magnitude of the 7.5 earthquake preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't run away immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not happen alone. He brought cars, wooden pieces, dwellings, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the middle of the sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and stores, damaged and damaged bridges, as well as a water mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (PPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, bordering a long narrow bay, could have widened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the debris of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be greater over the 300 km of coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" since Donggala," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials stated that the waves had arrived the time the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building shouting frantically to street passers-by that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power breakdown that cut off all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to provide aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but displaced persons always need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The tsunami casualties are increasing, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The Donggala World Vision staff arrived safely and except in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the victims, some complained that experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares it's a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we're still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, relatives of missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students found themselves trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagi.
"As an old man in the discipline of the paragliding, I experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages WhatsApp to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtleize $26,750 when charging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 to a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle was living a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly noticed many suspects leaving the premises, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: " Formerly known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before he went to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaced that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation for his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has religious significance for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us.
I moved from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - it reflects good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, also played on the union trait and the capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that he will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco's spot that "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by granting monthly allowances to students and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double financing in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leading innovation AI by 2030.
"double funding for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries have a long advance on the United States, and we are looking for the next great discovery in AI," Lee explains.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of U.S. AI, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the American Othello player best ranked. He then joined the Microsoft Research management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It is not China that appropriates academic leaders, it is companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recruited large university names to work on AI.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the United States' efforts in the field of AI.
"I think green cards should automatically be given to AI researchers," he says.
The China Council of State Affairs unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year for IA research.
In parallel, the US legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their voices in a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would solve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces of Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right in its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population in Macedonia, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and the EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which have been recovered from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which had mobilized 66% of the voters registered at the end of the election.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments, with unemployment in the country exceeding 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after filing his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard hit on pro-west government policy since its seizure in May last year.
Decisive action : Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, is breaking a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the game 2-0 Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, at 65 minutes, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine buster received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green sweaters.
He went around a defender before he wiped out others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's keeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55.60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at the time."
But it was Sterling who had given Skyblues the initial advantage during the First League match,
From 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane did a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scarzer wants to play trouble-fests against the Rockies
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start in a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of an elimination game for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Division West of the National League.
The Rockies took him 5-2 against the Nationals Friday evening, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Although this game is not at stake, we want to crowd the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in the face of a team that will probably be playing at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave room in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Lawyer is 18-7 with an average of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on catch in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that had generated his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by discussing the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight all fronts for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care about who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. This is what they want, power and control, and we will not give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it over the last four days," he added, before qualifying Democrats of people "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Justice Committee of the United States Senate and the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was worth the public hearing.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians from the Labour Party considered not to be welcome, all for having expressed our ideas.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham East Labour was notified on Friday: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday evening were for my eight years as a parliamentarian of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many meetings and the promise of smoother and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that the opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took over. Members with whom I thought I shared a similar political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take positions against my beliefs, whether regarding national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I followed an abusive tyranny on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in admiration of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who are faced with a deferral of genderist or racist speech every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the standardization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted as a result of the defiance motions and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so loud, and everything will be fine.
But it is not to act as I do in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion Friday, is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think it is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invincuous
Two late tests may have failed the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Scottish rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defence and the way they are seized of the opportunities that enabled them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this game.
"So far, we have been tested. But we remain invincuous, so I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they were more effective than we were and they knew how to seize the opportunities."
The 14th minute trial of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow card for Scottish Wing Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers spoken. Jason Baggot took on an unprocessed trial.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half-time. He marked and turned a solo essay to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started the second half-time, and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
He followed a long wait due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a cider. At the recovery, Ayr resumed the fronts with a trial of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, interim captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed trial by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team recovered in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having tapped Climo while he had not the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the trial, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wingman away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game Star launches into the restaurant
Ford Kieran, Still Game's star, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-ordinates with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphilll.
The duo announced that the ninth series that comes will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings bear a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases show the following bike: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present. Just as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have not been so tangible for several decades, and Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a wide-screen basis throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will take action in favour of the Bolivian demand. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage into the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will vote in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The United Nations instance based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have harmed her.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The rhetorical warrior of Morales undermined all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
Monday will provide Bolivia with "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bungalow.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, stated that his country would not differ from its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chimeric" to think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will fold the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of pre-significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious resignation of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is a debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in top cover, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect from the sun at 100%, don't look anymore.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of dazzling oversized hats during a PE19 show that honored the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
All more extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delicious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's light piece was a beige eccentric hat decorated with a wide edge that evoked a feather, which swallowed the heads of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-skinned pastries, a witch hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips sewn and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another thought of a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the "Bomba", the wide straw hat that the stars take off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that sells this difficultly portable hat that flooded the social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a handle of white leather, was the masterpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus parade at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops for the next summer. The creator has marked the spirits so clearly that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent examination results enhanced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS) strive to offer the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a bond of trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of the reviews this year, it is noted that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained the highest score, A.
Data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students obtained the highest grade, A in Mandarin, as well as 72% students who studied German, 69% students who studied French and 63% students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Employment Commission and skills conducted in 2014 shows that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to preparing young people for their future careers.
With more language-needing job opportunities, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of their choice of career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 among 4000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not control a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be given a better chance of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are important to the United Kingdom in 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, regardless of what future reserves them.
It is clear that at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of crucial importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We've got to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make its beginnings with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who watch the beginnings of LeBron James at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in the opening of a pre-season, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably be playing for a few minutes.
After the training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaign in Virginia-Western ( YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump starts this evening a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stairwells, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
Since the vote to confirm the vacancy to the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump sought support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevented the Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow him online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidates' hearings of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping the Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president stated in his campaign that the five meetings were designed to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will become in as many states as possible at the beginning of the electoral campaign in charge," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh's media."
Saturday, it will be the second visit in a month of Trump in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the Western Virginia Senate, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep hope at Sunday's simple approach
After three simple, Saturday afternoon forsoms could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The momentum balancer movement is an invented sport concept of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
So where would they find the momentum now?
"They were carrying six points in advance and now four, so we get a little wings," Jordan Spieth said while he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a bit of the wind in the doll and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can be proud of getting each three out of four points.
Spieth has shown himself to be extremely effective from tea to green and set an example.
The cries of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he were led down two after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, raised a similar cry from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in high school.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four in four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped it Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as the players to beat Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a potential European victory while the sun lies on the Gulf National.
Instead, both at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, a hero of morning's ovenballs, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never see.
On the other hand, no one's here on Sunday to help you.
Fourballs and forsomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can slip into a wink.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this ant session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, especially in the country.
Europe takes 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's fourballs and forsomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain her title in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made a difference by imposing itself 3-1 in morning ovens in front of a disorderly American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in forsomes and won two victories, but they have failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Furyk's men need to pick up eight points on 12 Sunday in the simple ones to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four sharp points, while Molinari and him, named "Molliwood" after a failing weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's story to get four points in their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who sneezed during the two matches on Saturday, has sparkled a few times, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and forsomes, and seven sharps.
Justin Rose, well-rested for morning ovens, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning victory 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, in a fresh but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas established the reference for Americans by marking two Saturday points.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Pollter in the fourballs and again beat Pulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in the forsomes, they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had nothing but to play no game to retain its trophy.
After having been second for two days, however, they may not be able to recover from a counter-attack Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will in no case become unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions strengthened his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the global body, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill last year”, such as those to end such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known criticisms of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded if it had gradually taken action, its statement was important that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made in Singapore on 12 June at the very first summit between an American President in exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim undertook to work for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking to formally put an end to the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal coercively, even opposing the "war-end declaration".
"Those who think that these sanctions can make us cry do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the part concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had declared before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles to North America after President Trump's "evil" described Kim as a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not praise Kim for the courage with which he had applied disarmament measures, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no deadline had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already traveled to North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang stating that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim calls for the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore, and for efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has established a new course that allows all first-class students to sleep more and fight against the growing male trend that consists of studying by consuming caffeine all night.
One teacher noticed that most of the students at the world's best university are unable to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why did you tell me that in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, stated that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that the students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, according to us, they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of " spending a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in an inanition mode, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year in Harvard.
He stated that the course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that he be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the designated institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both sleep and awakening time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disturb their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers suffered a new hard blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team was hoping to record his first victory on the move since his 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team shot Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team on the drift, eight points behind the Hearts, leading the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for Rangers, referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team suffocated his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let him pass his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the free coup when Steven Lawless and he collided, but referee Steven Thomson rejected Colombian's requests.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' halted footfall.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball back to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange was quite likely to have an immediate impact when the wing appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett shooting long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken advantage of it in the last few moments, but McGregor took good care to push Jacobs back before Lithgow passed by the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was being caught with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
One man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity can really be heard."
Evans: "So say, it's sure it jumps here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them into a laboratory.
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them into a laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results indicate we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein " causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal.
A similar approach, consisting of the removal of immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has proven itself in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Headed with a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after its passage to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was horrified on the platform after a slow performance during which he praised American President Donald Trump for a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to present himself for the election in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang with a Make America Great Again cap, West took over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I talk to White people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of the West Diatribe was relayed on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was going to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a gulp," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the gouffer?" and said he would wear his superman hat, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments attracted him at least twice on the part of the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on site told the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the entire shelf."
West had been called to replace at the last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disbanded many people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest minds: Thanks for HAVING HOLD TO THE FULE."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and spills a bad ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and stated that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed its name to symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: indictment of attempted murder after an assault on the white gun in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.

The accused is expected to appear on Monday before the Court of First Instance in Belfast.
The heads of charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantastic medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took it to the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to be turned into tough leather to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he felt "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, Covedette of Game of Thrones, also 31 years old, admitted that he was "firmly" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have damaged masculinity.”
"What lessons have we taught to young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behavior has been taught?
What does television and street teach young boys to think they have to behave like this in order to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not perform prologues or follow-up when the series will end next summer, stating that he had finished with "the battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a recovery from True West, from Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, to Leslie's family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of its inhabitants with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was virtually reduced to zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed data about senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the American republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information regarding three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages dedicated to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democratic stated that these statements were supported by "extreme right" experts and websites.
"False lies, lies, and even infamous lies" responded Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It would seem that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This misleading allegation is completely false and a real lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former press deputy of the White House.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not question the prosecutor's motives.
She must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also reported his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, underdue spy
It has now become a tradition of looking for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and renewed surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisty on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new chance of export?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes peeled and his face in rubber, has seen his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his doubtful attempts at glamorous charm, has some Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in Les Chariots de Fire during the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
Originally, he was also inspired by the international mystery traveler and man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor and that the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at the time when "serious" licences such as 007 and Mission impossible make themselves confident with comedy.
Humour seems more oriented towards children than towards adults and, for me, Johnny English's fake adventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's character.
The perpetually current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a role of low-level woe for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the scenario.
His intelligence advisors inform him that each active spy has been compromised, he will have to get someone out of his retirement.
This means that you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful stuffies here, because English offers a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-haul partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create great trouble at Her Majesty's secret services, re-examine the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful mortal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the grip of the technological charismatic billionaire that says he is able to solve Britain's computer problems: the fatal Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssée of fake jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set fire to a brilliant French restaurant; they create a chaos by faufiling on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to become familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All the arrests are insured for this last sequence, but nevertheless there's nothing wrong with the children in all this.
A rather moderate movie.
I couldn't help thinking, as for other Johnny English films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan to allow the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country towards workers.
The shift to a week of four days was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one night, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party stated: "A four-day workweek does not constitute a party policy and is not envisaged by the Party."
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to provide details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed his determination to regain power by "anonymous administrators" and "profits" in public utility companies.
The plans of the alternate Chancellor also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their disposal since the Labour Government may perform "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private business capital to employees, which will cover up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy entrust "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation of charges brought against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Have you done this?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she names couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old affair.
I see nothing new that changes."
What did the Global Citizen Festival do and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive stand-up of stars and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people going to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the provision of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, email a world leader, telephone or make any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to persuade them to demand a call for action, or is it just another example of "climaticism" - situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" on the part of its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of over $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Beginning 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including a tranche of at least $10 billion already paid or lifted.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executors who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda to provide £35 million in Sterling to put an end to malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that as a result of more than 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "what makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major movements in the defence of civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be performing this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will love the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, Ryan Zinke, the US secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways of remedying it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "Energy Consumer Spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one rope at its bow" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These declarations come at a time when the Trump administration committed itself to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the value of the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said: "I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States generated negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections of 2020, states the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was planning to introduce herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," says The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidature to the presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it is expected to appear in 2020.
According to the poll by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other very well-known names of democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 include those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes the PTSD of Track Palin during Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What is happening to my own son now, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and certain injuries our soldiers return with," she told the public at the assembly for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a "taboo subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they return a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air forces, and each other military, have given the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a legal challenge to the new American policy which refuses asylum for victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a statement in favour of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the American authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which authorized illegal immigrants fleeing marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "does not include decades of State, federal and international law."
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the Amicus Curiae stated in his memory.
The lawyers also argued in the memory that immigration's refusal of entry policy is detrimental to the American economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
" Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political beliefs," said Sessions on 11 June in its announcement of the said policy.
" Asylum has never been designed to mitigate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of family, comforting her youngest boy in Palu, in an empty city evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen to travel to their destroyed homes, to collect destroyed property, and to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" using "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had a four-page advertisement featuring the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to get involved in the US parliamentary elections of November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to get involved in the U.S. elections, Trump noted what American officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures aimed at hitting state exporters such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion paper published in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, at Beijing's press office, you will find few disputing voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that Chinese people can have on the troubled Chinese economic path, because the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist party," he writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has avoided publishing" his article, not to mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are bringing the electors closer to the mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's breakdown.
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case were extremely strong, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse stated "that we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute efforts made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in favour of an FBI investigation were enough to calm the electorate's anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not November," she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang "November is coming!" in the corridor of the Senate while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be too much," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban voters and young voters aged 18-29 who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be likely to be alive if the Republicans were to advance the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that "It became a mess for the GOP."
"It's not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor about the appointment of Kavanaugh. It's also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected democrats in the television newspaper.
As a result of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, however, Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of both sides, a small majority of which lean on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of the people consulted believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's free platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was intended to "dominate the world".
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a voluntary coder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and he are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not a complete change is necessary where all their business models are completely camouflaged in an instant.
"We do not ask permission from them."
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the [Inrupt] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid web."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Churchman of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman in the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden in Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his great-grandchildren, said it was "brightly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the firing line and, with the "greatest braver," led the line before jumping a campaign cannon to him alone and joining three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, claimed that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him."
The mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent all night looking at a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event included 13 combats, including six on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the viewers from the United Kingdom were sided when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to the cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding transmission, Bellator's Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Dave Schwartz, stated that "the government regulation states that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's programming."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were a lot of messages in both ways and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five battles instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" in sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, took a leave of absence for several months because of her illness.
As a wrecked in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the true things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medal is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of a cancer three years later - he said confided that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same heights and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought I'd win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets to London 2012, since he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: "Father, you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he died so that I would finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"That was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home during the Olympic Games, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired him his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - who had accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. BST.
An off-formed Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bank Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get up to avoid this being a unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fourballs and forsomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the fifth great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and refining his game at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He has never been the greatest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rush systematically punishes the wrong shots.
And as if the race wasn't quite daunting in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday game, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 games in simple, start a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much about anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demi, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play."
The captain of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simple of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful path.
The Danes played their first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally stood at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible deviation on the finish line, taking it 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were leading widely in Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but of justice," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 ranking win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go deep tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over before you have the points in the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I've always said I focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we're very aware of what's going on on the other side - they're the best players in the world."
Enjoying the performances of its players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and everything else goes.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to pass on to the players, it's to shoot the best of you tomorrow.
When one leaves his partner behind himself, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these last day shifts, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Medinah Miracle", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you have seen it in Brookline, as you have seen it in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do it, we are trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of carrying out the counterattack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pollter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple terms.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service before at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenditures.
According to Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was expected to integrate the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery issues of concern compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
However, according to Die Zeit, the constant delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the frigate cursed F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were not known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
Software malfunctions were particularly important because Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, the ship appears to be considerably overburdened, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is estimated to weigh twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), compared to $2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The officer stated that the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Bade-Wurtemberg class were able to join the Navy.
National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands field seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the comments will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-ear brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of the screams of bats and the activities of different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the bolts and results in the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as kill-mouse papers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, perchuring inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats on the site of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Three, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But much more remains to be learned about bats, so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before the maintenance of the property was carried out, since by destroying it without a single mother's nest, 400 females and young women could be killed or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their traps.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide his assistance.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes rape charges while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as "misinformation," and stated that people "want to make themselves known" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Youth was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he would have paid $35,000 to keep her silent on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were broadcast, Ronaldo, aged 33, described this information as "misinformation".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera the five-time Gold Ballon winner.
"They want to be a pub using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player said smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages proportional to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consented.
Majorga also stated that she had visited the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "terrorized by reprisals" and feared "to be publicly humiliated."
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “forever regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had just lost its position as world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain would withdraw from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of border delays on the eventuality of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, built almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are that car manufacturers qualify as risks to the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "soft stream", parts arrive every 37 minutes of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on orders.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's cheque plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, she advised, however, that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsovallaris, the coordinator of the United Union trade union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and possible impediments to the justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether or not Trump will send back the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he introduced himself to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump stated that he "would rather not" refer Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press attaché, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can resist another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press informed."
The statement would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has held no press conference at the White House.
The cheerleader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of conferences was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they are missing the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that "the president participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We checked the figures."
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, "but if the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and it will take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare that there are press conferences alone.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times an odd appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
With regard to concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to them and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British Government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the second of the Tennessee Tigers, was operated urgently after an injury to the head on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the State of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before the middle of the day.
"He arrived on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a cider and taking it to another examination.
A state representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there were "not yet any details of the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plaquages in total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 plaquages.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they purchase property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they purchase a property in the United Kingdom - additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing themselves to providing more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen the government's efforts in the struggle to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp right, including the higher levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to £120 million Sterling a year.
About 13% of new London buildings are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents primers from making a place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who stay most of the time outside the country.
This new policy only occurs a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right of stamps to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing the large construction companies of maintaining the real estate prices at a high level by capturing land without using them, he invited Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "real estate damage" imposed in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "no fault" evictions.
He also wished to give the advice more extensive powers to build new housing.
May stated: "Last year, I stated that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do so, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair to make it as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of access to property has become far away and the misery of homeless people remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland Technician Jack Ross explains that his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is delighted to meet the challenge of rebirth of the North-East Club, which is now the third place of the League 1, three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Scottish First League last season.
"I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's games in Hampden with my father and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only present itself if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland pickers are Dick Advvocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician stated that he did not hesitate to store behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not consider myself a success here unless I get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa get back from a relegation into third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the board of the relegation, into a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa's support "probably was a real road," he recalls.
"I really felt that being a coach was better than playing.
That sounds strange because I got away with it, that I made a good living and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to deal with every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine for me.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my entire adult life."

The summer canicule has raised the incomes of British audiences in difficulty, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunbathing and the longer participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following the June model, where bars had experienced an increase of 2.8 per cent, except for restaurants, which had been further shocked.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the catering sector in June was only worsening in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic drinks are served are by far the most in vogue, with more points of similarity than the lower restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restorers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and hospitality RSM, said: "These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors with regard to sales on the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales by 4.8% on average annually is particularly painful, in addition to continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will give a good respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the UK's Coffer Peach Tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children have secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one out of five children - some of whom are only 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "principal" account to show their parents
One child in five - some of whom are only 11 - opens an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "main" account cleaned up to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “violent ” me.
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, half of the students recognizing having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and World Athletic community, and we are confident that athleticism in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metre and 400 metre races in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after having undergone a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would seem to me to be restored or to what extent.
It was a hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!

Online, an advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a milking fire compares nursing mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "the first silent milk shot in the world", Elvie, a public technology company, launched a bold advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milk throw offers to nursing women.
In a barn full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rate of a song whose words are: "Yes, I live myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, no nipples."
The refrain continues: "Pick it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help women milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are taken away in the days after their birth," wrote one of them.

Another commented: "It's a trauma understandable to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk shot for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the impression that I was a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who draw their milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement that commends the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women revealed that they had danced with discreet milk-shooters hidden in their bra-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk are saying that they feel like they are cows.
However, Elvie's milk is completely silent, without wires or pipes and quietly fits into a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milk will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk-shooting has been done in one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled quietly in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have complicated the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared to compromise their own ability to stay in the country through the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of persons arrested had no legal background.
"About 80% of those who are respondents or members of their families are illegally here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to prosecute these people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have established new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case in relation to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed not eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to the speakers and reports that have been submitted over the past few months through the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that the movement of children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty in managing.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been evicted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "carry this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged" both by both terrorist groups and by any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has over 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said regarding refugees, that the conditions were favourable to their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "proclaiming irrational concerns" that have deterred refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union stated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition aimed at ending this war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel Idlib fortress has enabled political negotiations to advance.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and hoped that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the Nusra Front fighters, who are related to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, removal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would probably be "The most spectacular end of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during the big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, the dramatist of the ABC "Designed Survivor" who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Chapter.
Nell Scovell, a famous comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some irrefutable truths about sliding into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, Washington scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his "Fear" book on Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a garment filled with pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If part of what he does gives the impression of seeing a TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily situation shifts (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't have to.
When I contacted Mr.Fleiss this week, he was working 26 degrees at his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he landed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we excited all these crazy shows and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr.Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money invades the tightest elections in mid-term
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to an adjustment of the Congress's electoral districts, which allowed two holders to dispute the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh suburb, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has established his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another licensee, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping the new 17th District.
The cards were redrawn when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the republicans.
The race of the new 17th district has led to a confrontation with the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won by justice last March during a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point victory in the district.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China and then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had little opposition to.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the department at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions have only been imposed against Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, particularly to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against the Salvadoran people.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now voting at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show how important the administration attaches to the meeting has been to inform diplomats.
And the three American emissaries returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the anonymous cover.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next tile could be the report of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also orientate his investigation into the issue of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hand in hand, Mr. Trump will be obliged to report to this body, as he prepares to represent himself before the electors and perhaps before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many "yes", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact on the potential duration of this fight.
In 1938 the German officers were about to organize a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had led him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr Trump returns the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the reporting of the Times is inaccurate.
"What will we answer if the recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Mr Trump for an account?
If we fail to succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the table treeing the swastika.
With this heritage heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, trusting in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify as Group G in the League Europe.
A knee injury deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation from the season until the game nil 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game by thinking about getting something and we started with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but overall, a zero game was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half-time and we came back in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they did a good result during their last game, however I am sure that we can continue and achieve a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let us hope we can go forward now, leave the season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent reported having told their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do the necessary things to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with repurchase value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to secure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the crossing.
Provide a health care department that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There are not only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?" Martin asked.

A man was wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man received several bullets fired with a compressed air rifle as he walked home from an evening.
The victim, aged 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove region in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance sheet should increase.
Since communications were paralyzed, relief services were not able to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) from coasts to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency population, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the central Sulawesi province, and especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times for a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on December 26, on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that had dropped across 14 countries, killing 226 000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake reached southern Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake rocked the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake rocked the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was interrogated for suspicions of marital violence, contravening a report of marital violence and resistant to arrest, as reported by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held under unsecured bail of $500, said KTU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his defense was requested, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to one year and liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with marital violence, interference in the report of a crime of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed he hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to the PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
The earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victims' balance should be increased in the coming days.
The earthquake was declared just off the center of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video broadcasts on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami landed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a person suspected of terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assaulter who has victimized eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, would have used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a cyclist on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, floating on its pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a federal high jury sentenced Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a thorough preparation and premeditation," said the prosecutors, calling the method used by Saipov "hateful, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York City, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years that followed the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been moved to commit the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He appealed not guilty to the 2 heads of charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, declared himself "obviously disappointed" in the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the Conservative conference.
The former party for the independence of the United Kingdom indicated that politicians should "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's deputies suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative colleague Peter Bone stated at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faces in order to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has a hard time maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to remain and the EU.
The allies stressed that she would continue her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between her programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone indicated at the meeting of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Checkers".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that he would have been entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Checkers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not committed ourselves to world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the release, was also present at the march to tell the journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who silence the streets and make us choose first and foremost.
Leave Checkers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms May, she added: Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they honour their promises."
"Mr. Farage told the meeting that politicians should be brought to "feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to deceive Brexit and we say to them today, "We will not let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I wish you would feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have branded conservative banners against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because of security issues related to the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are in a position to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, presented for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of the speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to present herself to the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the time of the death by bullet of Sims of the State University of Louisiana
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by basketball player Wayde Sims, a basketball player at the LSU on Friday.
Baton Rouge police service participated in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man on the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by bullet on Friday morning, near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound in his head and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot down by Simpson.
Inquiringly, Simpson admitted that he had found himself in the premises, in possession of a weapon, and had shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained for police service at the East Baton Rouge parish.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, had 32 games, including 10 as a last season, and totaled an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading to the world title after the team's guidelines have enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became evident from the moment Valtteri Bottas became qualified by advancing Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and starred Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to embark on the platoon tail torment, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through the stands a turn later and found herself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheel-wheel action that saw Ferrari's pilot leave the inside at risk of resistance after a double defence attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to target a speeding arrival and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the stands at the 44th turn, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen clasting fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate in recent days, when one sees anger, when one sees people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"Seeing disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking of the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received last July from Ford the letter describing in detail the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the meeting: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Pursuing his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the machining, they don't care who they hurt, they have to crush to get power and control," the president told Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Friday defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by picking up the game back 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality back before Dwyer returned the advantage to the Giants.
François Bouchard equalized Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having won in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the fourth minute advantage at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the set four minutes later.
During a first well-preserved period, Sullivan revived the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt served Cownie at 15:16, with equalization.
Dwyer secured the advance of the Giants before the first break when he struck his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen place Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring victory for his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died assisting hundreds of people aboard an aircraft to escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others died after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan grande refused to leave his post in the violently shaken tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Siriat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, stated that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balykpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be helped," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman
Waves measuring up to six meters devastated Palu, who will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide support and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Flight Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that flowed.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not react immediately to more specific requests for passenger information, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses thought the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes says.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide through the water to the emergency exits of the plane flowing.
He claimed that the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that the sailors who worked near the improvement of a dock had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the farm before the plane flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people died in accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its file on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone calls records from a cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The telephone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
Defence must begin its advocacy on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A trio hip hop wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by imprinting its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins from political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
A New York New York Newman pursues a couple in court for dismissing her after a "racist" text
A New York New York New York Newman continues a trial couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a erroneously transmitted message from the mother who complained that she was "a black one again."
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates prosecutions to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his dismay in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black at her arrival for her first day of work.
"Nooooooooon ENCORE A NOIR," writes Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gaff, "disease to feel comfortable," Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice back, explaining to her that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting rather a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice is pursuing the couple in court to obtain compensation for her dismissal and claims $350 a day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said in Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust him after he had done him wrong.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Similarlying the trial to an "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small bear in teddy bear, would remain optimistic in the face of the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-water" taste after her death last year.
She described Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a calm man, and he was not a pretender," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to Louis Pastor 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given to her to maintain her heart rate were slowly exhausting and leaving her system.
She had been dead some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, in her daughter's mourning, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicide on the bridges.
Two women who have lost their lives because of suicide are trying to prevent others from living.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile was illuminating any room."
However, he left his job before he died, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I constantly fear there is a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and who you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet – you should talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She indicated that her death had represented a huge trauma for them, but they had to get out of it: "It's heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was at stake while the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for -- a limited investigation of time, limited in scope -- we could perhaps bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "fare" in a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, that is, November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met through his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI presented its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We still do not know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to start the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters "falls" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Department of Southern unification, stated that 1,127 deserts had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing fares claimed by passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized area (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriations.
The relationship between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in discussions focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had been pending so far.
This occurred after the historic meeting of June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the main, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to engage in unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelossi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate committee of the judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes nearly screamed and choked by referring to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling it "grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disillusioned Liberals that Hilary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he took over the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to detach Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unable to sit in the Supreme Court, but he's also unable to sit in the court where he's currently sitting," said Pelosi.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also added that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings of charges, Mr. Kavanaugh dismissed the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, "it's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women must use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and it cannot bring it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was a fit somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You can think that I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she went on.
And I found this brilliant."
The tears are allowed as exhalation to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehension.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying out of an inexpressible rage, was to have been caught by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little terrified - who had trained me in a stairway.
"Don't let them cry at all," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and excited because they've had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of herself presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a maturely thought-out decision," she told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "The Snow White and the Seven Nains."
As the campaign was very advanced, she had been late in fundraising, and she swore that she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually gave $1,000 to men, intended to give only $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a rebate?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt astonished about it.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press to her.
"You would have thought Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"Did she cry?"
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the trade war between the United States and China were shocking, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
American President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by charging key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), thus taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing has resorted to nature, recently hitting customs duties from 5 to 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will immediately waver.
Getting Washington back is yielding to demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security's thinking group.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn crossed the line of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, plunged his departure into the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players that has never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was dismissed 5 to 4 by the least well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help him," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said Rahm, aged 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record at Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who has scored 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time across the weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance regarding his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to join up, I'm going to work with the Americas PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love those guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to bow down.
We've gotten over it."
Point info on the red tide: Low concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in the concentrations of the red tide in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which cause fear of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coasts, from northern Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
There are islands about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in less sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off the county of Pinellas were reported last week, low to high concentrations off the county of Hillsborough, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or at the width, medium concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in Lee County and off the county of Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwest Florida last week.
