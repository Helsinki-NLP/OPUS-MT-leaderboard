This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely distributed, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid colouring at the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachide, but has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, researchers have concluded that the rachide is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for the flight, but rather for the temperature adjustment or for the courting. Researchers assume that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the pimp.

Huhne resigned and will be replaced to the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the role of Minister for companies left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Court of Judges of Westminster is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21-year-old.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo surgery to reconstruct the face.
Uka's weapon didn't explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind by an eye, lacks a section of skull and his face has been rebuilt into titanium.
Schneider witnessed through videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent it registered a DNT. Other 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race he participated in, the giant slalom, saw him rank tenth in the women's group "sitting", with a combined time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first class, Austrian Claudia Loesh, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female strikers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their face covered.
None of the three people who were at home at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the Audi TR red.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital at Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Cambridge Hospital.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the accusation of killing his own son.
It is held pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eye witness could be polluted, as its image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who publish photos or other of suspects, walk on a busy land".
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has informed journalists that new comments will not be issued at least until the formal indictment.
According to what has been said, the subject of the document will be the dispute on the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive security training and instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Election Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the Fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenged the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the failure of the elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused small burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) claimed to be aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was informed by Apple of another 34 accidents related to overheating, which the company has called "non-serious".
In his reply, the ministry defined "absolutely depreciable" the deferral of the report by Apple.
The earthquake at Marianne was at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
According to the Northern Marianne Island Emergency Management Office no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of tsunami in action.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took hostage to the tourists of Hong Kong after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza has set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released immediately with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins tracked his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
After attending the obstetrics training, in 1959 he entered the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving the hospital, in leisure time Liggins began studying cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His wrestling comrades also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, exactly like her. A strong woman."
"The moon was weird like me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... we hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people who opposed the transition from Australia to republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
To the opponents of the survey, 29% of the respondents argue that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three staff at the Commonwealth Games, but it accused several disorders that led to doubting its physical form.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the first largest number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that led on earth water and organic matter, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having been confronted with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he has placed his signature on a law that makes legal marriage between people of the same sex.
He said speculations are nothing but "political gossip and idiotism."
It is assumed that a presidential application will take place in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than obsolete ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No extra transport is being arranged and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking for cars or interchanges are not available on site.
Fear related to the absence of means of transport has given rise to the possibility of having the match played necessarily closed, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published on Thursday in the magazine Science, on the Galapagos islands in Ecuador a new species of birds would be born.
According to researchers at the University of Princeton, USA, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time needed for this process was much greater; this as a result of the coupling between an endemic fringe of Darwin, Geospiza fortes, and the fringling of immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be curled and intertwined. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand painted images in the books called "minimized codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes colour according to the acid or basic (alkaline) chemical element.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions consist of protons that have been torn away from electrons (because hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, remains of sewerage have been discovered in the homes of the Minoic cities of Crete and Santorini.
The cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public baths, attended by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then returns it almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to provide us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to its invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats in freedom) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called branches.
Branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a numerous family of daughters and sisters.
The lion-white acts in a very similar way to the wolf or dog-white, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other great females), even as regards deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, jump very long and exercise a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it more resembles a phrase of angry and angry words.
Birds love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, sitting on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as be able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the ocelots mimic with the surrounding environment and then fall on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population to which it belongs (e.g. if you move over a mountain range or a river, or move on a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment different from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to become a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed earlier.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is still less and less similar to the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different between them that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed from humans and absorb carbon dioxide ejected from them (through exhalation).
Plants develop their nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from the plants and produce the clothes with the plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without the plants the animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the superpredator of his era and therefore feared nothing, except the other Mosasaurs.
From its long cliffs more than 70 sharp teeth emerged as razors, plus another row located on the palate, so for whoever crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had the biforcated language. His diet included turtles, large fishes, other mosques and it may also have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, the Roman banquets also included various strange or unusual ones, such as the wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called gyrus.
Another difference was that while the poor and women were eating sitting on chairs, wealthy men loved to feast together while lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for every divinity a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People were offering sacrifices to the gods and priests trying to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurat, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was taking place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was scarcely populated. In the northern sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red to name it, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time the evicted tribes already lived there.
Although all "scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the film "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
However, this is false. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down in the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large document of parchment (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) has been rolled to be moved back.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only set as a label.
The D-Day landings and the clashes that followed had led northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
He was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had released southern France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, making up a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e., citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in some way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means to transmit knowledge through several generations, to leave an indelible cultural footprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true and own civilization.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at national level, it relied on the State authorities, often uncooperatively, for the implementation of their acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was necessary. For them, they had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most common sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see the Italians committed to competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, we refer to Japan as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who traveled from there barely record the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch Company of the East Indies in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, beginning a transformation that involved the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and employing Chinese bracelets to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Chinese-Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, thereby giving way to the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, including the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still under way.
The most common format in the world for photography fixed images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film on the end of the age of analog photography.
It still occurs today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the formats of the digital cameras image sensors.
Strangely enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integer numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derisive rule of third parties is a simple guide that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where placing the main subject corresponds to the intersection of lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was examined.
Christian religion had acted as a link between European states for over a thousand years, despite language and customs differences.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of the hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civil supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by numerous international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain has undermined international waters to prevent access to any whole-area ocean vessel, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and exhilarations of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated very singularly: every period of China or any family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, among many nobles in the struggle for the throne there are fierce wars.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all candidates men, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the military classifications, instead of being class-based, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to begin their revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond earth’s life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passing of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave stands on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knew the existence of it. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large amount of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only arrival to the present day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Giza Necropoli", in the Kings Valley in Egypt, hosts several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), several smaller tombs, several temples and the great Spinge.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arched up" looks like a V and the indication "arched down" looks like a graffiti or a square without the bottom side.
Going up means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the wing (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow toward yourself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it results in a stronger and more resolute sound.
You may decide to add your custom pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archeggio you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Luigi XVI, in captivity to terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Maria Antonietta, to their two little children (Maria Teresa, aged 11 and Luigi Carlo, aged 4 years) and to Elisabetta, the sister of the king.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point someone among the crowd showed the Queen terrified the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the huge gains resulting from the exploitation protracted in the time of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars we need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when the events took place is commonly called the Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII century (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Middle Ages, which was concluded by convention in about 1500.
Technology Determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that man's fate is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are developed to reduce costs related to the ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture related to this geography have emerged, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved to be more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known nowadays as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued around 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, especially because of the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were assessed more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the capital title of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached in the period between the X and the XI century and the XIV century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by East Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the lines of communication makes it possible to delay the spread of styles in the West by 25-30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie the clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised for the sole purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Agriculture of subsistence is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining maximum from crops.
Historically most of the farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, which do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialisation is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who have grown up without proper socialization with adults due to neglect, as a result of adventurous or intentional abuse.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before leaving or escaping.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within the physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning even simpler and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, the more it helps those who undertake a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the launching of a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small graffiti-shaped assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and aim at questioning, soliciting and explaining procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given in trust for various reasons ranging from abandoning abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nutrition, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that the entrustment represents a safe area for these children.
Our entrustment system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The entrustment is supposed to satisfy all the unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratification.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998)'s study on public reactions to websites has identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relations".
The use of video recording has allowed significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements of the duration of a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying to interpret microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks explained how people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
It even maintains that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and express variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is removed from the pool of variability expressed.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribution the variability forward and backward between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive device similar to that of humans it is difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins present in leaves and vegetables, but for primates like us are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors themselves have resolved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a sleep recovery (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to bring you to a state of consciousness, without awakening you completely.
If you decide to reset your watch to sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorrhythm-centred options provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up in bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Minor is tension, more positive is the existing life force. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and payment.
All can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but it has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayan rite and various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in a path of omnicomprehensive love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (light energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the fulcrum of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various divinities the energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the system conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the breakdown between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of a time had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been founded; the only option was to beat up and reorganise along the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were immediately obsolete, as more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Taking advantage of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods through the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country the safeguard of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time contrasting the ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most worthy of note is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German military navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, the goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of antiquity to easily have milk, vellum, meat and skin available.
The domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These shepherding methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England the cars were built.
Although they were formed simply by parallel wooden axles, the wagons, if compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses who were able to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively soon to keep track of the tracks. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to those in iron. In 1767 the first fully iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Humans began to walk in upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (meaning "right man").
His predecessor, the australopite, did not walk usually erect.
Signs of specialization for bipede walking are present in the fossils of Australopiteco dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent the future sufferings we can begin to adopt lifestyles more respectful of the environment, we can join the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while problems have increased due to overcrowding and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's print a few blocks away.
At night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Manifestos of Dunlap".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it read to his room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 embroidered Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that accompany them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two back legs.
Ultimately, handling of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, that is 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be obvious immediately. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence at home of an open container of medicines or harmful chemicals.
Check whether first aid instructions for that specific poison are available on the label.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed chemists, insects that have been strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both the killer chemists and the bed chemists are niches, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their guest.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has recorded about 400,000 known cases, placing in the first place among neurological diseases affecting young people and adults of half age.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double with males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in their child’s interest.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their children.
In one adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not only experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible assumptions; even asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacteria.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophagus with radioactive sulphate.
Mutations may have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the part of the genetic material involved and depending on whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting the natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo oranges.
Every morning, people leave the small countries of the countryside to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they just left.
In this dynamic, all are somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses the transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they dumped every day? Are the engineers who design them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Transfic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to the next and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because drivers' behaviour cannot be expected with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented in a generic mathematical way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) range, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to highlight the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Much of the insects benefit from the ability to fold the wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small amphitheaters to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones who are unable to fold the wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone was right, but many others believed the opposite, that is, the solar system, including the Sun itself (and even the other stars), was moving around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some points reaches six miles.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Rio delle Amazoni main river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It pours the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
They continued to build pyramids in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never overcome in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the lowest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: land, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more to the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theoryd that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillion of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower and less widespread status.
Today they all write messages on computer screens and never have the need to approach a temperament.
We can only ask ourselves what fate will have the keyboard when something new comes up.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a core with many protons and neutrons is at the base of the fission pump operation.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a weak push or nothing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava on the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people associate with and motivate them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that motivate them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most widespread content are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to direct their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
To the opposite end, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire work of the team and do it itself.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This attitude often generates disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as meetings may take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be included in local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
It is defined as "invisible team" the management team to which each member refers and that is what sets standards for each member.
Why should an organization be willing to address the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When you manage to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organization to define itself innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes more narrow and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is at the heart of scientific research.
It has long been known that some types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This offers us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong scientific fantasy connotation, the IA represents a branch of the very important computer science that deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The trips represent a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by the technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also an excellent pretext to share experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennett School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Often, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a grammar and an untreated spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, in order to avoid negative opinions the author of the blog undertakes to improve writing.
The blogs also "enforce students to become more aware of the moment around them."The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is an instrument that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning far beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's evocative and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell about the country's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and north you can admire the natural and uncontaminated beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to foreign opinion.
The larger northern areas are sparsely populated, among them some of which are almost deserted wildlands.
If a comparison of the population is made, the result may be quite surprising: in the United States the number of African Americans is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent itself.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, ranging from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by Sahel, while to the south and west borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that all declare that they are married, regardless of the actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one of appearance too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and be not afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it by the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghiles and a lot of quincaglierie, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, just a short distance from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside Goma, so as to assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a wedding (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short race.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant earth.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its most Arabist touch than African, the city stands out clearly from the other parts of the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in north-east South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which sustains a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry into the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card might also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, represents for many tourists the main destination.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glistening bar graph, even more evident because framed by Victoria Harbour's waters.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon Waterfront in front.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong island focused on the densely populated northern coast areas.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point to start from.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastline of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild fauna; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 real Bengal tigers and about 30,000 maculated deer.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those headed east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two stretchers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two wide lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction ended in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when probably the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed, the bridge should be fully functioning.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomad hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who lived hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish gave rise to a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Association Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the sterling of the Falklands (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British sterling (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers the currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on peripheral islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands out of the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below that marked by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "poor" seasons defined: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to man's sight, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how sweet they may look: bisons, wings, deer, bears, practically all large-sized animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not maintained an adequate distance. They need to be given adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that the smells can attract the bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying with you or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upulu and its population has little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the notorious naval stall of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the trees of pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitetata.
These are suitable beaches for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. You can make the bathroom safely.
The most popular local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better deal with the journey.
The water of the local tap is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, the bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. The espresso' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and accidents for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, comply with the instructions and pay particular attention to security alerts.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can find only occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he has reached his destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer breakfast packages, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some musical festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive soon and get a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stage, there may be sections of the festival where the music takes place until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the crossing of the ice causes rather annoying noise for those who are more exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to spend exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted exemption from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to increase the time and money spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests' mood high so that they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability of judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures near zero.
On frozen and snowy wagons, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive like when it is on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, within a very short time so much snow may fall to keep you stuck.
Precipitation and snowflakes, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, may also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, chepards, and leopards are sometimes fearful, and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binocular.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari hiking", or "safari walking") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics took place in 1964.
If your reservation for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the referral was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among themselves, however most cancellation policies related to coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not reach July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for the events will be between 2,500 and 130,000, while the normal tickets will cost about 7,000.
Stretching wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have iron, or if you don't like to wear woven socks, you can try with a hairdryer if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these prove to be more effective against specific risks.
In certain areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubts it is appropriate to assess the purchase of water packaged within sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come in contact with animal parasites which are not spread in their home regions.
Pesticides may damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmission of poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely enough, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are rather good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighbouring Austria most south.
Sweets to fruit are an endless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German oven cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other shelled fruit. The most popular cakes often accompany very well a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but tasty sweets can be guided by those who, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can occur either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for turkeys in inland regions, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term usually indicates foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Japanese cuisine, now widely distributed throughout the archipelago, offers a series of simple dishes of preparation; its predominant flavors are derived from the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Japanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffs are supports for the foot of the rider and are hung on the two sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present security problems for the possibility that the rider's feet will remain blocked.
If a ghost gets kicked by a horse but has a foot stuck in the staff, it could be dragged by the horse that runs away. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially those in English, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather staff pull out of the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important destination for climbing in Chile, known as the South America Yosemite, where there are a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from every part of the world continuously trace new roads on its walls, potentially infinite.
Sports on the free descent snow, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and are expected to slide on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also referred to as "ski bums" (ski bums), who dedicate entire periods of vacation to skiing activity in a particular area.
The beginning at the base of the ski is very old: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Hiking on the skis: the activity is also called off-road, mountain skiing or trekking on the skis.
It is connected, although usually does not include them, to the touring ski or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and shoes.
Think of the ski track as a trail similar to that hiking path.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way greater than those walks, but only very rarely will you reach the speed of the cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries, visas should be requested and passport checks should be carried out several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area works rather as a single country.
If you remain within this area, you can normally go from border to border without having to overcome passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to request visas for individual Member States, thereby obtaining a savings of time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a piece of antique work. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition is geographically different from the age limit which can be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antique parts, although more recent than such items in series.
Reindeer farming is an important source of subsistence for the Sami and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over the course of time, not all Sami were involved in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale; some lived of fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as work animals.
Today many Sámi perform modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a notice for travellers is to be issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but bear in mind that such opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simple compared to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression indicating any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social distress or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types of weather, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, precipitation above the norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to temporal, tornado, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are the storms, the snow bubbles, the ice storms and the sand storms.
Travellers are recommended to inform themselves about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they could influence travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a potentially considerable country as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally address all the issues here discussed in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who have scheduled surgery to change sex abroad must make sure to have with themselves the documents valid for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no indication regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the availability of foreign governments to accept these documents.
Inspections of security controls also became much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001.
People transgender in pre-operative stages must not expect to pass checks without their privacy and dignity being impaired.
The resacc currents are the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral barrier or similar formations.
In view of underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can be formed.
Most of the dead survive because of fatigue in the attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, getting back to the swim will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to identify an area where there is no risk of being trapped again, or assess whether to wait for the rescue, based on your skills and if you have been sighted.
The shock at return occurs in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a lower phase of honey moon), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patients and understanding people, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were needed even for those in their homeland.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is how much more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and every pyramid is lit.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of an still active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a 360 km chain cut into two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as Sentinella Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massiccio, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone does not usually constitute a mobile phone replacement, because to call you you must find yourself outdoors with the naked view up to the satellite.
The service is often used by sports boats, including sports boats, as well as missions that need data and remote voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a Saturday year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among neodiplomats, since they can take a year before starting the university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the Sabbath year can actually increase the chances of taking higher education back to their country of origin.
Registration of these educational programmes usually requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. There are also thousands of islands within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos in the "Land of the Thousand Lakes".
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly wide enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
The boat is Finland's national pastime, where a boat counts every seven or eight people.
This is also true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is quite unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises include a stay of several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, going back to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa (from 2009 onwards) will not be required for the descent to the ground using the excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal adversities that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people to understand a little how airplanes work and what happens during a flight may prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or not having control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some trips, larger companies use their aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it happen faster would be to send it as a storage baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice number for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class positions.
The airlines are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and conveniently to their destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but not recognised by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Smirne is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although in the city there is an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the large streets, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are lined with the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the 18th century market, mosques and ancient churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views on the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the shrine of the church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
In the north lies the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The line bus Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions around the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common moat, and has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen their dear murders or made to work until death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid beatings on the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid disturbing these places by hugging the structures with signs or scratches.
In Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by almost everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
By metro, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any interruptions of the service not scheduled are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to find yourself in Paris remains to behave best, relating as a "high ben" (well educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The harsh outward appearance of Parisians will quickly vanish if you browse some basic good manners.
The National Park of Plitvice Lakes is rich in forests, mainly beech, fish and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimes, soils and different altitude levels, there is a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a vast variety of animal species and birds.
In these places there live rare species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar cock, alongside several other more widely spread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries make available stoules for women arriving unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or sister at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down their knees.
Even these can be borrowed at the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you might not feel at your ease. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Major cuisine, such as that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa with Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments found, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All the nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei", always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are spoken as it is written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the voice below.
Also make sure to pronounce differently "r" and "rr": dear means blessed, while carriage means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the times regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you very much with Persian grammar and in understanding phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and should therefore not be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observers are often obsolete and function as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in the cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in lost areas where the weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherries flowering, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 15th century.
The concept was native to China, where plum flowering was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherries flowering parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to also take "only" an example.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the distance from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy to spin city; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to count with the hot (always) and the strong sun (most rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible were buried Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inside of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland watercourses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and in the Rhine Valley, you can make a cruise to visit the interesting Danube cities or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and well-known cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
A tradition plans to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place in order to admire the dawn.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations at the base of this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches, an Easter vigil is celebrated on Saturday night of Easter, with congregations that often begin the ceremony at midnight to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally reached the islands reached us by swimming, flying, or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals were unable to cope with the journey. This made the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
At Galapagos were introduced numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are scarcely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing is normally made up of jackets and ties or tailors and is addressed to colleagues with their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, since it attaches importance to the group's commitment rather than to commend individual achievements.
Workers must often receive the welfare of their superiors on every decision, and we expect them to stick to the instructions without asking questions.
